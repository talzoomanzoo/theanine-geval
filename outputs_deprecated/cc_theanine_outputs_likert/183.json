Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on.\nChild: What is it, Parent?\nParent: I created a website where I post advertisements, and people can pay to see them.\nChild: Oh, that's interesting. How does it work?\nParent: Well, I create the ads myself, and then I post them on my website. People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them.\nChild: Do you think people will pay to see your ads?\nParent: I don't know yet, but I hope so. I've put a lot of effort into creating some eye-catching ads.\nChild: That sounds cool, but why do you want to make money from ads?\nParent: Well, I want to have some extra income coming in. Plus, I enjoy being creative and making things, so this is a great way for me to combine those passions.\nChild: I see. Well, I hope it works out for you, Parent.\nParent: Thanks, Child. And who knows, maybe someday you can help me create some ads for the website.\nChild: Sure, that sounds like fun! Speaking of creativity, remember that time we made those homemade decorations together?\nParent: Yes, I do remember that. That was a fun afternoon.\nChild: It was! Maybe we can do that again someday.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe Parent values cherishing moments with loved ones and stresses the unpredictability of life, which makes the Child feel it is unfair that they have to do certain chores because the Parent is too tired. The Child suggests creating a schedule for chores to ensure everyone contributes equally, and the Parent agrees to make an effort to start pulling their weight around the house and follow the chore schedule. In open communication, the parent and child discuss various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores, leading to the Parent being seen by a doctor and taking medicine for their illness. The Child expresses gratitude for being adopted by the parent and believes other children will be lucky to have them as a parent, supporting the idea of the Parent adopting more children and hoping for a happy home for them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers some historical context about the Parent and Child's relationship, including themes of household chores, the Parent's illness, and the Child's adoption and gratitude towards the Parent. However, there is little direct correlation between the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which primarily focuses on the Parent's project of creating a website for advertisements and the creative bond shared with the Child through a past activity.\n\nWhile the MEMORY reveals certain aspects of the characters' personalities and relationship dynamics, it doesn't provide specific information that would likely inform or enhance the continuation of the ongoing dialogue about the advertisement project or the reminiscing about shared creative activities. The MEMORY's content could offer some background understanding of their interactions and familial roles, but it lacks direct relevance or connections to aid in generating the next immediate response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
