Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret?\nNeighbors B: Of course, what's up?\nNeighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door.\nNeighbors B: Oh, why are you hiding from her?\nNeighbors A: She wants me to go to a family dinner tonight, but I'm too tired and just want to relax at home.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you should talk to her about it and let her know how you feel.\nNeighbors A: I know, but I don't want to disappoint her.\nNeighbors B: It's important to take care of your own needs and speak up for yourself. Plus, maybe you can compromise and go to the dinner for a little while and then come back home to relax.\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of compromise, remember that dinner we went to a few days ago?\nNeighbors A: Yes, it was so much fun!\nNeighbors B: I'm glad you enjoyed it. Maybe we can make it a regular thing and try out new restaurants together.\nNeighbors A: That sounds great! And it gives me something to look forward to after work.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A and B joke about the fun aspects of using telekinesis to surprise people. Neighbor B is excited and supportive of Neighbor A's new ability. Neighbor B offers support and suggests planning a dinner to celebrate Neighbor A's new adventures in learning. \nNeighbors A enjoys cooking and made roasted vegetables and quinoa for dinner. Neighbor B offers support and suggests planning a dinner to celebrate Neighbor A's new adventures in learning. \nNeighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation. Neighbor A is thinking about exploring new skills or hobbies outside of work, such as taking online courses or learning a new language.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'll start looking for some new restaurants for us to try out. It'll be a nice way to unwind after a long day.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information about Neighbors A and B's interactions, particularly around shared interests such as cooking and hobbies. However, it lacks direct relevance and beneficial contextual cues to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which centers around a family dinner issue. The MEMORY includes different topics like telekinesis, cooking, and new skills, but these do not connect well to the conversation about compromise and attending family events. Moreover, the repetition in the MEMORY (e.g., \"Neighbor B offers support and suggests planning a dinner\") does not provide added context or relevance to the ongoing dialogue in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, MEMORY falls short of providing clear development or relevance that would assist a language model in generating a more contextually aware response."
