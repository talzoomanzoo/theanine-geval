Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned?\nClassmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed.\nClassmates A: Embarrassed? Why?\nClassmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier.\nClassmates A: Come on, tell me! I won't judge you, I promise.\nClassmates B: Well, I accidentally spilled my lunch all over myself in front of some people.\nClassmates A: (laughs) That's it? That's why you're embarrassed? I thought it was something serious.\nClassmates B: (sighs) Yeah, it's silly. But still embarrassing.\nClassmates A: Don't worry about it. It happens to everyone. Remember the time I tripped and fell in front of the whole class during our presentation?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A successfully lands on a moon but is running out of oxygen and needs to repair the ship to get back home. This leads to Classmate A showing determination in fixing their spaceship after it was damaged in a meteor shower, which prompts Classmates B to praise Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n\n2. Classmates A and B have been on field trips to other planets or moons before, like Mars, which is a topic they both enjoy. This admiration makes Classmate B see Classmate A's attitude as a good example for others. As a result, both classmates value supporting and uplifting each other in their learning and growth, leading to Classmates A helping Classmates B out of friendship and believing in supporting each other.\n\n3. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during a difficult situation, which is hindered by Classmates A helping Classmates B out of friendship and believing in supporting each other.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Haha, I do remember that! Thanks for making me feel better about my lunch mishap. You're right, embarrassing moments happen to everyone.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains sentences that narrate fictional space-related events and interactions between Classmates A and B. While these sentences are imaginative in nature, they do not directly relate to the current emotional situation discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which involves an embarrassing incident of spilling lunch. The MEMORY primarily focuses on past supportive interactions in adventurous or difficult situations, which could vaguely relate to encouraging and supportive behavior. However, the specific context of embarrassment and casual exchange about a spill isn't reflected in the space-themed MEMORY, nor does it illustrate the immediate emotions and relational dynamics of the dialogue about embarrassment.\n\nThe structure of the MEMORY is somewhat coherent, but the content doesn't provide clarity or relevant cues for responding to the specific scenario in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT surrounding a commonplace incident. The vague connection of supportive behavior provides minimal usefulness, hence the score of 2 for a lack of relevant development and relevancy to the context provided."
