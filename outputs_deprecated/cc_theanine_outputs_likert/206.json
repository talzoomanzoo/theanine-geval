Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager!\nCo-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge.\nCo-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail.\nCo-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader?\nCo-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago.\nCo-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality.\nCo-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes. But it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Remember when I was really stressed about you not liking me?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember. But we worked through it, didn't we?\nCo-workers A: We definitely did. And it taught me to just take things one step at a time, like I am with this new role.\nCo-workers B: Exactly, and I'm sure you'll apply that same mentality to your training as well. I remember you were really dedicated to it a couple of years ago.\nCo-workers A: Oh yeah, I still try to keep up with it whenever I can. It's important to stay physically and mentally fit, especially with this new job.\nCo-workers B: Just don't let your anger get the better of you again. Remember when you exploded and started throwing things?\nCo-workers A: Ugh, let's not even go there. My parents gave me a good scolding for that.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A fantasizing about being a great leader led to them emphasizing the importance of communication and aspiring to be respected and admired.\n\nCo-worker B encouraging Co-worker A to pursue a leadership position resulted in them stressing the significance of communication, conflict resolution, and taking small steps in conversations.\n\nCo-worker A's fantasies of being a great leader influenced them to prioritize getting along and working smoothly with Co-worker B, despite feeling stressed about their past relationship. This stress caused Co-worker B to advise Co-worker A on managing emotions and addressing the issue openly.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Well, it sounds like you've learned a lot from that experience. Remember to keep your cool and handle any challenges that come your way with grace and composure in your new role as a product manager.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes references to past interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, such as Co-worker A's fantasies about being a great leader, their emphasis on communication, conflict resolution, and taking small steps, which are all relevant themes in the dialogue context. The MEMORY also mentions the stress Co-worker A felt about their relationship with Co-worker B, which was discussed in the context. Additionally, Co-worker B's advice on managing emotions and addressing issues openly is relevant to the dialogue, where Co-worker B reminds Co-worker A not to let anger get the better of them. However, not all sentences in MEMORY are naturally connected to each other, slightly hindering the clarity and flow. Nonetheless, the information is relevant and meaningful for understanding the context, which is why it scores a 4."
