Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on.\nChild: What is it, Parent?\nParent: I created a website where I post advertisements, and people can pay to see them.\nChild: Oh, that's interesting. How does it work?\n\nMEMORY:\nThe Child suggests creating a schedule for chores to ensure everyone contributes equally. The Parent acknowledges being lazy about washing dishes and promises to contribute more to keeping the home clean. The Parent has seen a doctor and is taking medicine for their illness.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is focused on the Parent's new project involving a website for posting advertisements. While the MEMORY details previous interactions about household chores, the Parent's acknowledgment of laziness with chores, and a doctor's visit, these points do not establish or support the context regarding the Parent's project. The information is not structured to draw a relevant connection to the current dialogue about the website's functionality. As it stands, the MEMORY does not provide helpful cues or context that would significantly aid in generating a relevant response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, though it is presented in a clear and naturally phrased manner."
