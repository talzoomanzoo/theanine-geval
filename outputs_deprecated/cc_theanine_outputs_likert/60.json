Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A suggests grabbing lunch together, showing an interest in spending more time with Classmates B. This indicates a desire to strengthen their bond and enjoy each other's company. As a result, both Classmates A and B enjoy talking to each other and consider themselves great study partners. This positive interaction is further emphasized when Classmate B admires Classmate A's dedication and believes they have a knack for science. The conversation flows smoothly as they share a common interest in science, with Classmate A mentioning their favorite Lady Gaga song, \"Born This Way.\" Additionally, Classmates B is considering taking biology classes in college to deepen their understanding of how the body functions, while Classmate A is driven by a passion for science and dreams of becoming a doctor or researcher to make a difference in people's lives. Their good relationship is evident through expressions of admiration for each other's intelligence and sense of humor, fostering a supportive environment for their academic pursuits.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a detailed and comprehensive background on the relationship between Classmates A and B. It includes various aspects such as their mutual interests, shared activities, admiration for each other's qualities, and future aspirations. This information is relevant and beneficial for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT because it highlights the established rapport and mutual respect between the two classmates, which can help the language model predict the tone and nature of Classmate A's important discussion. The MEMORY is structured in a logical and coherent manner, clearly demonstrating developments and connections in their past interactions. However, while most sentences are relevant, the mention of Classmate A's favorite Lady Gaga song, \"Born This Way,\" is not directly useful in this context. Despite this, the overall MEMORY remains highly helpful in setting the stage for an understanding of the dynamic between Classmates A and B."
