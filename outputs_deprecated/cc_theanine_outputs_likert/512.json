Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I know you know something about my past. Can you tell me what it is?\nClassmates B: I'm sorry,, but I can't disclose that information. It's not my place to tell.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B warns Classmates A about the potential danger of dark alleys because Classmates A doesn't have their own car yet and takes the bus.\n   \n2. After discussing the benefits of a positive mindset in making a difference in the world, Classmates B appreciates the genuine friendship and positive attitude of Classmates A, which leads to Classmates B encouraging Classmates A to keep striving towards their goals. This makes Classmates A curious and open to exploring new things and taking risks.\n\n3. When Classmates A and B discuss the benefits of a positive mindset in making a difference in the world, Classmates A was nervous about fitting in but saw Classmates B as well-liked and wanted to be friends with them. As a reaction, Classmates B advises Classmates A to be careful and aware while on the bus, relating to the topic of warning about the potential danger of dark alleys.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's okay, I understand. I appreciate your honesty.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some helpful information regarding the general relationship and interactions between Classmates A and B, which could assist a language model in generating a continuation of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, the MEMORY provides insights into the trust and camaraderie between the classmates, hinting at why Classmates B is reluctant to share certain information about Classmates A's past. Furthermore, it depicts both the protective and supportive nature of Classmates B towards Classmates A. However, the specific details and past dialogues presented in the MEMORY are somewhat tangential to the direct request and denial conversation occurring in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY could be enhanced by including more focused sentences directly referring to the past instances where this specific topic of discussing or hiding information might have come up. Overall, the MEMORY successfully demonstrates the relational dynamics but lacks direct relevance to the immediate dialogue, thereby limiting its helpfulness in generating a precise next response."
