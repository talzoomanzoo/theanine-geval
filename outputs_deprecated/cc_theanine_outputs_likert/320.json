Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today?\nCo-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there?\nCo-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done.\nCo-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Co-worker B is supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable, as both co-workers show a supportive and caring attitude towards each other.\n- Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions, causing Co-worker B to be supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable.\n- Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits, reacting to Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides, while still wanting Co-worker A to be more responsible and avoid such situations.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Co-workers A",
    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, that was a rough night. I've been working on being more responsible with my outings since then.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant context concerning the interactions and relationship dynamics between Co-worker A and Co-worker B. It gives insights into Co-worker B's supportive and caring nature, their concern about Co-worker A's lifestyle habits (punctuality, drinking habits), and their encouragement for Co-worker A to improve their responsibility and reliability. This can be helpful as it gives background on the supportive dynamic and some challenges Co-worker A faces and Co-worker B's reactions to them, which can be useful in understanding the line about getting stranded due to being unable to drive home. \n\nHowever, the MEMORY does not directly relate to the discussion about the post office or sending packages in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, and the sentences provide more generalized past interactions rather than detailed specifics that connect directly to the current dialogue. Furthermore, the two sentences in the MEMORY have some redundancy which could slightly confuse the language model in determining the direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
