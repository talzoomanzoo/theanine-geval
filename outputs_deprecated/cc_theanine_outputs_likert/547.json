    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today?\nClassmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B are both keeping up with the homework in their math class. This leads to Classmates B finding it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after a conversation they had about following dreams. Consequently, Classmates A and B enjoy jamming together and plan to collaborate on music in the future. Their friendly and supportive relationship is evidenced by their conversation about their respective experiences.\n\n2. Classmates B is interested in learning to play an instrument, while Classmates A bought a sleek and red Mustang GT car. This purchase leads Classmates B to recently buy a red sports car and find driving it to be fun and freeing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I understand how you feel. Is there a specific situation that's been bothering you lately?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided has limited relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around Classmate B's feelings of frustration and desire for independence, but the MEMORY does not address this directly. Memory 1 emphasizes a supportive relationship and shared music interests, which could be tangentially relevant if the frustration is related to musical pursuits, but it lacks direct connection or causality with the specific context of B's current emotional state. Memory 2 discusses interests in musical instruments and cars, but again does not directly relate to the core issue of frustration and desire for autonomy. Therefore, while there are elements of context about their relationship, the provided information does not effectively aid in generating an appropriate response to Classmate B's feelings of frustration in the given conversation."
