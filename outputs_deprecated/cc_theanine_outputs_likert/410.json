Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm really excited about finding a buyer for my product. I think it has a lot of potential.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A is working on improving themselves after being advised by Neighbors B to change their behavior at work and be responsible. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's efforts to change and appreciates their support during difficult situations. Neighbors A acknowledges the need to work harder, be nicer to colleagues, and improve their behavior, as they are having issues at work. Neighbors A and Neighbors B have a friendly and supportive relationship, enjoying coffee and chatting together. Neighbors B expresses a desire for Neighbors A to succeed, emphasizing respect and effort at work. Neighbors A reassures Neighbors B that they had nothing to do with Neighbors B's missing dog.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about the relationship and history between Neighbors A and Neighbors B, which could be helpful in understanding their dynamic. It indicates that they have a supportive relationship and that Neighbors A is working on improving their behavior based on Neighbors B's advice. This information could help a language model in framing responses that reflect this supportive dynamic. However, the MEMORY does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about Neighbors A being excited about finding a buyer for their product. There is no direct mention of the product or how Neighbors B may be involved in this new development. Therefore, while the MEMORY provides some useful context about the relationship, it does not directly aid in generating a response to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
