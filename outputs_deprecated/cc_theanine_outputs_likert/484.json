Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately.\nClassmates B: Why is that?\nClassmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically.\nClassmates B: That's a good goal to have. Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra?\nClassmates A: Definitely. I feel like I'm able to break down problems and analyze them more effectively.\nClassmates B: It's always rewarding when hard work pays off.\nClassmates A: Yes it is. It reminds me of when I proved my brother wrong in that race. I was so determined to win and it paid off in the end.\nClassmates B: It's great to see that determination and hard work lead to success in different areas of life.\nClassmates A: And even when I felt that pain in my arm, I waited and it eventually went away.\nClassmates B: It's important to listen to your body and take care of yourself.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates B emphasizes the importance of enjoying the journey and effort put in, not just focusing on winning. \nClassmates A reminisces about a past race with their brother and a conversation with Tyler about a personal issue. \nClassmates A is always looking to challenge themselves and improve their skills.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant context to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights Classmate A's focus on self-improvement and determination, which is in line with A's motivation to study algebra and become smarter. The mention of a past race with the brother connects to A's recollection of a race in the dialogue, and the idea of challenging oneself is consistent with the goal of developing logical and critical thinking skills through algebra. However, the MEMORY could be more helpful if it provided more detailed connections or examples from past interactions between the classmates. The mention of a conversation with Tyler is irrelevant as it doesnâ€™t relate to the specific context, nor does Classmates B's emphasis on the journey directly link to the given dialogue. The sentences in the MEMORY are relevant and naturally phrased, but the connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT could be more explicit to enhance its helpfulness further."
