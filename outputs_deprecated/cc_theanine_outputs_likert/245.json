Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\nCo-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A and Co-worker B plan to treat themselves to a nice dinner with their paychecks. Co-worker A suggests celebrating their detective work with drinks after work. Co-worker B, who is married, had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends. Co-worker A and Co-worker B reminisced about their happy memories from their time working together. Co-worker A is observant and used their Sherlock Holmes-like skills to find out that Co-worker B is married, which surprised Co-worker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does not provide helpful information for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around Co-worker A's singing at church and personal interests, while the memory focuses on unrelated details such as planning dinner, Co-worker B's marital status, and other events that don't connect to the dialogue context. There is no clear development or causality of past interactions between Co-worker A and B that connect to or enhance understanding of the current dialogue about singing. The structure of MEMORY doesn't aid in generating a relevant and coherent response to the context provided, as it lacks cues about the topic at handâ€”Co-worker A's singing passion."
