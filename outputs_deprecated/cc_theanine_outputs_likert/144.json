Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit?\nNeighbors A: It was Chicago. I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations.\nNeighbors B: I bet it was a nice change of scenery from our neighborhood.\nNeighbors A: Definitely. But you know, it's interesting how much our neighborhood has grown on me over the years. I remember when I first moved here, I was so unsure about it.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember. But you stayed because you wanted to be here.\nNeighbors A: That's right. And since then, I've made so many great memories here. It's become my home.\nNeighbors B: And you're still spending time with God every day, right?\nNeighbors A: Yes, I am. It brings me so much peace and happiness.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B appreciate each other as good neighbors and have organized a block party together in the past. This routine has brought positive changes, helping them stay focused, calm, and grateful. Spending time with God brings Neighbor A peace and happiness. Now, Neighbor A found a park and a coffee shop nearby that they want to visit.\n\nNeighbor A has been living in the same place for a long time and enjoys the neighborhood and people there. They feel comfortable and safe, have made good friends, including Neighbors B. Neighbor A values the relationship with Neighbors B and considers them like family. This makes Neighbor A excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends. \n\nNeighbor A has been living in the same place for a long time and enjoys the neighborhood and people there.

    "raw_prediction": "It's wonderful how much your neighborhood has become a special place for you. Your positive outlook and sense of community have really made a difference.",
    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY contains several relevant connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it also includes redundant information or less relevant details. The helpful aspects are as follows:\n\n1. It mentions that Neighbor A and Neighbor B appreciate each other, which aligns with the dialogue where Neighbor B appreciates Neighbor A's time spent in the neighborhood.\n   \n2. It acknowledges that Neighbor A spends time with God, which directly connects to a portion of the dialogue.\n\n3. It reflects on how Neighbor A feels comfortable and safe in the neighborhood and has made good friends, including Neighbor B. This relates to the discussions about the neighborhood in the dialogue.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY is somewhat redundant, with repetitive points about Neighbor A enjoying the neighborhood and valuing the relationship with Neighbor B. Also, the information about discovering a nearby park and coffee shop seems less integrated with the context provided. \n\nOverall, while the MEMORY has potentially useful information, its structure lacks conciseness and some connections to the key topics in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT could be more explicitly highlighted."
