Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, check out this spot I found to camp out for the night. It's perfect!\nClassmates B: Wow, this view is amazing!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B finds Classmates A's involvement in the community admirable and important. Classmates B remembers Classmates A's previous involvement in community improvement projects and acknowledges their passion for making a difference. As a result, Classmate A realizes that their current allergic reaction could be related to the previous discussion on allergies.\n\n2. Classmate A and Classmate B are classmates who attended a party together. In reaction to this, Classmate B suggests that Classmate A should go see the nurse immediately and take antihistamines if available.\n\n3. Classmates B finds Classmates A's involvement in the community admirable and important. This leads to Classmate A expressing a desire to find alternative ways to have fun and make a positive impact in the community. Subsequently, Classmate A, who is proactive and curious, takes the initiative to research topics of interest, resulting in the realization that their current allergic reaction could be related to the previous discussion on allergies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information about Classmates A and B's previous interactions, such as their involvement in community improvement projects and attending a party together. However, the provided details do not have a clear or logical connection to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about camping and the amazing view. While there is mention of an allergic reaction, it seems unrelated to the context of camping. The memory lacks coherence, with separate pieces of information not forming a clear narrative or development that would aid in generating a relevant response to the dialogue context. Therefore, the majority of the MEMORY content does not effectively contribute to a helpful or relevant response for continuing the current dialogue."
