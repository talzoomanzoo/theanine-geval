Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you?\nParent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe child's support and care towards the parent led to the parent being in juvenile detention in the past, where they made mistakes and are now trying to turn their life around.\nThe parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations, which caused them to now live in a little house in the suburbs that they love.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information regarding the Parent's past experience in juvenile detention and their journey towards turning their life around, which connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where the Parent talks about the importance of listening during tough times. This background contextualizes the importance of listening for the Parent, given their own experiences. However, the MEMORY does not directly support the specific dialogue about the emotional impact of listening or specific past interactions, such as the child's role in listening. Additionally, the mention of the parent's current living situation adds some character depth but isn't directly relevant to the dialogue, which is primarily focused on listening and feeling heard. Therefore, while the MEMORY contains some relevant context, it lacks seamless integration and focus on direct relevance to the ongoing dialogue, limiting its helpfulness."
