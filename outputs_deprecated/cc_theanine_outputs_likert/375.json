    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to share something with you. I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend.\nClassmates B: That's really kind of you. What did you do to help?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support. This has made Classmates B feel valued and appreciated. Classmates A saved up for the car despite it being pricey.\n2. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support. They both value their friendship and feel comfortable talking to each other about anything. Classmates A and B appreciate the support and friendship they have. \n3. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support. As a result, both Classmates A and B are looking forward to hanging out outside of school. They got a new Ford Mustang car and took it for a test drive on the highway.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I helped them fix their leaky faucet and mow their lawn. It felt good to lend a hand.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some information about the dynamic between Classmates A and B, particularly how Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support, and that they both value their friendship. This gives a general sense of a supportive and friendly relationship. However, these sentiments are repeated multiple times without adding new, specific information relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about Classmate A helping a neighbor. \n\nThe additional details about the car and their plan to hang out outside of school might be useful if the DIALOGUE CONTEXT was centered around those topics, but they aren't relevant to the current context. Overall, while the MEMORY does provide some insight into the relationship between the speakers, enhancing the memory with more details specific to the topic of helping a neighbor would make it more helpful for generating an appropriate response."
