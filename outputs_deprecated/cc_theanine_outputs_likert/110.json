Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become?\nNeighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out?\nNeighbors A: Yes, I go to the gym every day and lift weights. It's been really helping me build muscle.\nNeighbors B: That's great to hear! It reminds me of the time when you apologized to me for the way you treated me.\nNeighbors A: Yes, I realized that I needed to take responsibility for my actions and I didn't want to make the same mistake again.\nNeighbors B: It's always important to own up to our mistakes. It's like when you forgot your backpack in high school and had to deal with the consequences.\nNeighbors A: Definitely. It taught me to always be prepared and double-check everything. It's like how I make sure to tighten screws and wires when working on my computer.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A and B discussed the importance of taking care of trees and the environment for future generations. This led to Neighbor B accepting Neighbor A's apology and mentioning how hurtful it was to be treated poorly. In response, Neighbors A apologized to Neighbors B, admitted their mistake, and expressed a desire to make amends.\n\nThe conversation about the environment continued with Neighbor A apologizing to Neighbor B and showing a willingness to make things right. This triggered Neighbors B to remind Neighbor A about the importance of taking responsibility for past mistakes and learning from them. As a result, Neighbor A apologized again and acknowledged their wrongdoing.\n\nBuilding on the theme of environmental care, Neighbor A apologized to Neighbor B and expressed a desire to make amends. This prompted Neighbors B to suggest talking to the teacher so Neighbor A could potentially take a test on another day.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You've learned some valuable lessons from those experiences. It's great to see how you've grown and become more responsible.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it lacks clarity and coherence in terms of the development or causality of events. The MEMORY does capture the essence of past apologies and taking responsibility, which is a theme in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the information about discussions on environmental care, the apology, and the suggestion of talking to a teacher are not clearly connected or entirely relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY could be more naturally structured to better reflect the causality and connections between past interactions. As it stands, while there are some relevant elements that could aid in generating a response, the overall structure and phrasing do not entirely provide a natural or clear connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
