Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately.\nClassmates B: Why is that?\nClassmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically.\nClassmates B: That's a good goal to have. Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra?\nClassmates A: Definitely. I feel like I'm able to break down problems and analyze them more effectively.\nClassmates B: It's always rewarding when hard work pays off.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A is facing sudden pain in their left arm and is considering going to the hospital. Classmate B reminds Classmate A to trust their instincts and know when to seek medical attention.\n\nClassmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness. They offer support and suggest taking a step back to find a balance. Both classmates value taking moments to relax and appreciate the small things. \n\nClassmates A faced tough competition in middle school from a fast girl, motivating them to improve. They acknowledge the need to find a balance and accept the advice given. Classmates B is supportive and emphasizes the importance of having someone to talk to about personal matters. Classmate A emphasizes the importance of self-care and relaxation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about Classmates A's determination, competitiveness, and the importance of self-care and relaxation, which may tangentially relate to the discussion about focusing on algebra. However, the connections are not direct or strong. The MEMORY primarily discusses Classmate A's health concern and past experiences regarding competitiveness, which do not seem directly relevant to the current dialogue about algebra and logical thinking. While there are elements of support and acknowledgment in MEMORY, the information does not directly enhance or provide contextual cues related to the current focus on studying algebra. Therefore, the MEMORY does not significantly aid in generating a relevant next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
