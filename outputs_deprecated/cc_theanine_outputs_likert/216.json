Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax.\nNeighbors B: What kind of breathing exercise?\nNeighbors A: It's just a simple one, where you inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, and then exhale for eight seconds. I've been doing it every day for the past week and it's made such a difference.\nNeighbors B: That's really interesting. I've heard that breathing exercises can be really helpful for reducing stress and anxiety.\nNeighbors A: Yes, it definitely has helped me with that. Plus, it's something that I can easily do anywhere, whether I'm at home or out running errands.\nNeighbors B: That's great. It's always good to have a simple tool like that to help manage stress. \nNeighbors A: Speaking of managing stress, remember a few years ago when I pushed your shoulder because I wanted you to accept me?\nNeighbors B: Oh yeah, I do remember that. That was a stressful time for both of us.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A ordered a large cheese pizza with extra sauce for Neighbors B. This gesture of appreciation led to Neighbors A being willing to take things slow in their relationship with Neighbors B. In response, Neighbor B reassured Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasized their current friendship.\n\nNeighbors A surprised Neighbors B with a pizza, leading to Neighbor B valuing their friendship with Neighbors A. This made Neighbor A want to address an embarrassing past incident where they pushed Neighbor B's shoulder to gain acceptance.\n\nNeighbors A did this as a gesture of appreciation for Neighbors B's actions in the neighborhood. This led to Neighbors A being willing to take things slow in their relationship with Neighbors B. Additionally, Neighbor B, who has a son starting high school, understands the challenges and excitement that come with it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Neighbors A",
    "raw_prediction": "I just want to apologize for that moment, it was definitely not the right way to go about gaining acceptance.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly the reference to an embarrassing past incident where Neighbor A pushed Neighbor B's shoulder to gain acceptance, which is directly mentioned in the dialogue. This establishes a clear connection between past events and the ongoing conversation about stress management. However, the rest of the MEMORY, which focuses on Neighbors A ordering pizza for Neighbors B and their friendship, is less relevant to the current context of stress and anxiety management. The sentences in the MEMORY are naturally phrased and connected, providing a coherent narrative about Neighbors A and B's relationship and past interactions. However, due to the partial relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, the MEMORY provides only moderate helpfulness."
