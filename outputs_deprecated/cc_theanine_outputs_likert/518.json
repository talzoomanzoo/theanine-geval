Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother. This has caused Neighbor A to be tired of living in a run-down apartment complex and want to improve their quality of life. As a result, Neighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there. This change has led Neighbor A to find solace in nature and believe that it helps in coping with their emotions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe provided MEMORY contains information about Neighbor A's recent life changes, including the loss of their grandmother, the desire to improve their living situation, and their newfound solace in nature. However, this MEMORY doesn't directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Neighbor A is expressing shock and disbelief about being left by someone presumably significant in their life. While MEMORY does contain emotions and context about Neighbor A's personal life, it lacks direct relevance to the immediate topic of conversation in DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about a relationship ending unexpectedly. The connection between the memory about life changes and the dialogue about a breakup is not clearly demonstrated, making the helpfulness limited in this scenario. The MEMORY could benefit from more directly addressing relationship dynamics if it is to guide the generation of a more contextually relevant response."
