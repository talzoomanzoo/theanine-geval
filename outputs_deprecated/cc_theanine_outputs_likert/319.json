Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today?\nCo-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there?\nCo-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done.\nCo-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B is supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable. This includes being concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits, as well as encouraging them to give people a chance. Additionally, both co-workers show a supportive and caring attitude towards each other, with Co-worker A successfully not being late to work for weeks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains general information about the relationship between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, highlighting their supportive and caring dynamic. However, it does not directly relate to the specific context of the current dialogue about Co-worker A's trip to the post office. The memory indicates a supportive relationship, which is a helpful contextual cue for generating responses that reflect understanding and empathy, such as acknowledging the hassle of sending a package. While the MEMORY offers a useful background to understand the dynamic between the two co-workers, it lacks specific relevance to the current dialogue context around the post office experience. The sentences are naturally phrased and inform about the supportive relationship but do not provide specific cues connected to the conversation at hand."
