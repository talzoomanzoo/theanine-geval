Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I can't believe how honored I am to be part of our class. I feel like we have something special going on here.\nClassmates B:  You're right. Our class definitely has a unique energy about it. What do you think sets us apart from other classes?\nClassmates A:  I think it's our sense of community. We all support each other and work together to achieve our goals.\nClassmates B:  That's definitely a big factor. And I also think our class has a lot of diversity, which brings new perspectives and ideas to the table.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmates A and B are both interested in going to the mall near their school. This interest is shared by both of them.\n- Classmate B feels relieved that they can still be friends with Classmate A after a conversation about feelings. This conversation led to a sense of relief for Classmate B.\n- Classmates B appreciates Classmates A's honesty about their feelings, but doesn't feel the same way. This honesty from Classmate A resulted in appreciation from Classmate B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I agree, diversity is key. It helps us see things from different angles and learn from each other's experiences.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful context about the relationship between Classmates A and B, especially concerning their emotional interactions and shared interests. For instance, Classmate B's relief after a conversation about feelings indicates a close bond likely characterized by honesty and mutual respect. This memory can be helpful in maintaining a friendly and supportive dynamic, which parallels the sense of community mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the specific details about going to the mall and appreciation of honesty do not directly relate to the current conversation about the class's unique energy and diversity. While the MEMORY is structured in a way that depicts some past interactions, it doesn't strongly enrich the ongoing dialogue or provide specific cues to answer the current conversation. Hence, a score of 3 reflects the moderate helpfulness of MEMORY in generating a follow-up response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
