Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become?\nNeighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out?\nNeighbors A: Yes, I go to the gym every day and lift weights. It's been really helping me build muscle.\nNeighbors B: That's great to hear! It reminds me of the time when you apologized to me for the way you treated me.\nNeighbors A: Yes, I realized that I needed to take responsibility for my actions and I didn't want to make the same mistake again.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and B emphasize the importance of taking care of trees and the environment for future generations. This reminds Neighbors A of the time when they apologized to Neighbor B for their behavior and expressed a desire to make amends. In response, Neighbors B reminds Neighbors A about taking responsibility for their mistakes in the past and learning from them.\n\n2. Neighbors A and B appreciate the resourcefulness of using fallen trees for firewood or other purposes. This also reminds Neighbors A of the time when they apologized to Neighbor B for their behavior and expressed a desire to make amends. In response, Neighbors B reminds Neighbors A about taking responsibility for their mistakes in the past and learning from them.\n\n3. Neighbors A and B emphasize the importance of taking care of trees and the environment for future generations. This leads to Neighbors A staying up all night studying for a test and feeling terrible about forgetting the backpack, as they had once left their backpack at home and had to borrow notes from a classmate.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Neighbors B",
    "raw_prediction": "It's impressive to see how much you've grown, not just physically but also in your character. Keep up the good work!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information regarding Neighbors A apologizing to Neighbors B for past behavior, which is directly mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This provides helpful context for understanding the relationship and interactions between the two speakers. However, parts of the MEMORY are somewhat repetitive and do not significantly add new information or connections beyond what's already mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the apology context is relevant, the remaining information about trees, environment, and backpack incident seems less connected and could be structured more effectively to enhance the development and connection to the given context. This results in a moderately helpful MEMORY, justifying a score of 3."
