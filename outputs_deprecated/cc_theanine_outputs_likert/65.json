    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: I know about your affair with that other woman.\nClassmates B: What are you talking about? I don't have an affair with anyone.\nClassmates A: Don't lie to me! I saw you together at the restaurant last week.\nClassmates B: That was just a business meeting. We were discussing a potential collaboration on a music project.\nClassmates A: I don't believe you. You're just trying to cover it up. I'm going to tell everyone and ruin your career.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A expressed admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor, and they are both excited about seeing Lady Gaga in concert and looking forward to singing and dancing along to her hits. \nClassmates A suggests grabbing lunch together, showing an interest in spending more time with Classmates B, who is considering taking biology classes in college to learn more about how the body works and is balancing high school and college classes to be successful and help their family.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Please, let's talk about this calmly. There's a misunderstanding, and I want to clear things up.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not contain information directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Classmates A accuses Classmates B of having an affair. The MEMORY details about admiration, interests, and plans unrelated to the affair subject. There is no connection or development of events that would assist in generating a relevant response to the current situation. Moreover, although the MEMORY is naturally phrased, it lacks important contextual cues to aid in understanding the interactions related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY slightly hints at past positive interactions, which could offer minimal context to interpret the current conversation dynamics, thus warranting a score of 2 instead of 1."
