Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you?\nParent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference.\nChild: I'm glad you found someone to talk to. You know, I remember when we watched the sunrise together a few weeks ago. That was really special.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. [The Parent's experience in juvenile detention led to a newfound appreciation for small moments, such as watching the sunrise after leaving detention.] - (SameTopic) - [The child reminisces about a special morning watching the sunrise with the parent.]\n   \n2. [The child's supportive and caring attitude towards the parent inspired the Parent to find hope and value small moments even in tough situations.] - (Causes) - [The parent reflects on past mistakes and efforts to make positive changes in life.]\n   \n3. [The child's comforting reassurance towards the parent resulted in the Parent getting to see the sunrise after leaving detention.] - (Changed) - [The parent faced challenges during arrest and had to seek help from a lawyer and the justice system.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful and relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It effectively builds on the context by linking the Parent's past experience in juvenile detention with an appreciation for small moments, which connects to the Child's memory of watching the sunrise with the Parent. This connection is relevant to the dialogue context and provides a clear development of the Parent's character and experiences. The MEMORY also highlights the Child's supportive attitude and its impact on the Parent's outlook, which aligns with the theme of the importance of listening and feeling connected. While some sentences could be more explicitly connected to the immediate dialogue context, they are naturally structured and provide enough context for a language model to generate a coherent and informed response."
