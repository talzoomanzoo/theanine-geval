Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentee, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Thank you for finding my glasses for me, Mentor. I always seem to misplace them.\nMentor: Not a problem, Mentee. I'm glad I could help. \nMentee: This actually reminds me of when I was struggling with substance abuse. I would often lose things or forget where I put things because of my drinking. It's amazing how much clearer my mind is now that I'm sober.\nMentor: That's a great observation, Mentee. Sobriety can definitely improve your cognitive abilities and overall wellbeing. It's amazing how much substance abuse can hold us back in life.\nMentee: Yeah, it's definitely a difficult journey, but I'm grateful for the support systems I have in place. Like you, Mentor. Your experience and guidance have been invaluable to me.\nMentor: I'm happy to be there for you, Mentee. It's been great seeing you grow and develop over the years.\nMentee: Speaking of growth, I've been really trying to live in the moment lately. It's been bringing me so much joy and fulfillment, and I feel more connected to the world around me.\nMentor: That's fantastic, Mentee. Being present and mindful can do wonders for your mental health and overall satisfaction with life. Keep it up!\n\nMEMORY:\nMentor has been supportive of Mentee's journey to sobriety, and the Mentee credits Mentor for their help in achieving sobriety and expresses gratitude for the support. This causes Mentor to be proud of Mentee for making positive changes and taking control of their life. \nBoth the Mentor and Mentee believe that living in the moment can bring joy and strength in facing challenges. Additionally, Mentor has been in the business for a long time and has a lot of experience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you, Mentor. Your encouragement means a lot to me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that is relevant and helpful for understanding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It accurately summarizes the key points of the conversation such as the Mentor's support in the Mentee's sobriety journey, the gratitude expressed by the Mentee towards the Mentor, and their mutual belief in living in the moment. The MEMORY captures the key themes of the conversation and presents them in a structured manner that shows the development of the relationship between the Mentor and Mentee. However, the last sentence about the Mentor's experience in the business is less relevant to the current context of the conversation. Overall, the MEMORY provides a useful recap of important past interactions that help generate contextually appropriate responses."
