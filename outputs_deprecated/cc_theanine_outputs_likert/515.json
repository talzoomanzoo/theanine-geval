Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I know you know something about my past. Can you tell me what it is?\nClassmates B: I'm sorry,, but I can't disclose that information. It's not my place to tell.\nClassmates A: But how did you find out? I haven't told anyone.\nClassmates B: Let's just say I have my ways of finding out things. But don't worry,, it's nothing bad or embarrassing.\nClassmates A: Okay, but it's still bothering me that you know something about me that even my closest friends don't know.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A admired Classmates B's positive attitude and wanted to be friends with them. Classmates B warned Classmates A about the potential danger of dark alleys, advising them to be careful and aware.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some context about the past interactions between Classmates A and B, indicating that Classmates A admired Classmates B and wanted to be friends, and that Classmates B had given a warning about avoiding dark alleys. However, this information is not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Classmates A is concerned about a secret that Classmates B knows. The MEMORY lacks a direct connection or causality related to the conversation about how Classmates B found out about Classmates A's past. The relevance to the current discussion is limited, and it doesn't aid in generating a response specifically addressing the secretive knowledge aspect discussed in the context. Additionally, the MEMORY lacks sufficient detail to provide a comprehensive background that would help understand this aspect of their interaction, hence the score."
