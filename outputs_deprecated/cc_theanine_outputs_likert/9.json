Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you?\nParent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference.\nChild: I'm glad you found someone to talk to. You know, I remember when we watched the sunrise together a few weeks ago. That was really special.\nParent: It was. I love being able to appreciate the beauty of nature. And you know, having my own place to live in the suburbs makes it even easier to do things like that.\nChild: Yeah, your house is really nice. You've always been good at taking care of yourself.\nParent: Well, I've always valued my independence. Even as a kid, I wanted to do things on my own. That's why I decided to live on my own a few years ago.\nChild: I can see why you would want to do that. You're just really good at being self-sufficient.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The child's help and reassurance make the parent want to provide a safe and stable environment for the child, as the parent values independence and self-sufficiency.\n2. The child finds the parent's story inspiring, leading to the child being supportive and proud of their parent for making changes, and willing to help out if needed.\n3. Both the parent and child expressing love and support for each other causes the parent to find hope and appreciate small moments even in difficult situations, mentioning making mistakes in the past and trying to turn their life around.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains sentences that are relevant and helpful for the Parent to generate a suitable next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures the themes and emotions present in the dialogue, such as the importance of listening, independence, and the supportive relationship between the parent and child. The MEMORY helps to provide context to the Parent's past experiences and the impact of shared support in their relationship. Sentences within MEMORY are coherently structured and demonstrate a clear connection and development of past interactions. However, the MEMORY could perhaps provide a bit more direct detail from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT to achieve a perfect score. As it stands, MEMORY provides a strong foundation for understanding the parent-child dynamic at play, which is essential for crafting responsive dialogue."
