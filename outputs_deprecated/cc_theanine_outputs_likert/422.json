    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me.\nCo-workers B: That's amazing to hear. Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job.\nCo-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B was nervous about working with Co-worker A because of their talent as an actor. This caused Co-worker B to emphasize the importance of learning from mistakes and working together as a team. As a result, Co-worker A felt remorse for what they did and appreciated Co-worker B's understanding, leading them to be grateful for life experiences and open to new possibilities in the future.\n\nDuring their collaboration, both Co-worker A and Co-worker B felt that they brought out the best in each other. However, Co-worker A had a tough week on set, feeling overwhelmed and chaotic. This stress led Co-worker A to mention a past event involving blowing up a rabbit with dynamite, indicating a history of poor coping mechanisms for frustration, which still angers them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Co-workers B",
    "raw_prediction": "It's great to hear that you feel secure and motivated at work. Having that kind of support can really boost your confidence and performance.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context for generating a suitable response, highlighting the past dynamics and sentiments between Co-workers A and B. It has a narrative elaboration of their professional relationship, mentioning Co-worker B's initial nervousness due to Co-worker A's talent and the value they place on learning from mistakes. This part helps to understand the past interactions better and contributes to the co-worker's eventual gratitude, tying in with Co-worker A's current sentiment of feeling secure due to support.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY introduces some specific anecdotes, like the rabbit incident and Co-worker A's chaotic week, which, while possibly intriguing, don't directly connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The relevance of these details to the ongoing dialogue is unclear, as they stray from the main theme of gratitude and support from a boss.\n\nIn conclusion, the MEMORY captures relevant sentiments and professional dynamics but can be further refined to align more closely with the ongoing conversation, hence receiving a mid-range score of 3."
