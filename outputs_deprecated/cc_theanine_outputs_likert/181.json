Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on.\nChild: What is it, Parent?\nParent: I created a website where I post advertisements, and people can pay to see them.\nChild: Oh, that's interesting. How does it work?\nParent: Well, I create the ads myself, and then I post them on my website. People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them.\nChild: Do you think people will pay to see your ads?\nParent: I don't know yet, but I hope so. I've put a lot of effort into creating some eye-catching ads.\nChild: That sounds cool, but why do you want to make money from ads?\nParent: Well, I want to have some extra income coming in. Plus, I enjoy being creative and making things, so this is a great way for me to combine those passions.\nChild: I see. Well, I hope it works out for you, Parent.\nParent: Thanks, Child. And who knows, maybe someday you can help me create some ads for the website.\nChild: Sure, that sounds like fun! Speaking of creativity, remember that time we made those homemade decorations together?\n\nMEMORY:\n- The Parent acknowledges being lazy about washing dishes and promises to contribute more to keeping the home clean.\n- The Parent has seen a doctor and is taking medicine for their illness.\n- The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings.\n- The Child is caring and offers help to the Parent.\n- The parent and child have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I remember that! It was a lot of fun. I'm glad you enjoy being creative too, just like me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does not provide directly relevant or helpful information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding the website project or the Parent's creative pursuits. Most of the memory information pertains to different topics, such as household chores, health, and generic open communication rather than the specifics of the current discussion. While some mention of open communication suggests a positive interaction style that could help infer the Parent-Child relationship, it doesn't provide substantial helpfulness for generating the next response based on the dialogue about the ad website. Thus, it lacks the specificity and relevance needed to effectively support the language model in generating a response aligned with the dialogue context's themes."
