Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I really enjoy being a carpenter. It's a very fulfilling job.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate B is supportive and encourages Classmate A to pursue their dream, hoping the President will consider their concerns and make improvements for the country's betterment.\n2. Classmates A is attending a seminar on starting a business and is excited about applying that knowledge to future plans, as Classmate B wants the President to consider their concerns for the country's betterment.\n3. Classmates A is attending a seminar on starting a business and is excited about applying that knowledge to future plans, appreciating the President's difficult decisions to improve the country's situation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided is somewhat structured and contains some past interactions between the speakers, however, it is not very helpful in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 1 mentions Classmate B as being supportive and encouraging to Classmate A, which is somewhat helpful but lacks clarity and relevance to the context. Sentences 2 and 3 mention a seminar on starting a business that Classmate A attended, but they focus more on the President's decisions rather than the carpenter job mentioned in the dialogue. Therefore, the memory does not clearly demonstrate a connection or development directly related to Classmate A's enjoyment of being a carpenter, and does not provide a significant amount of useful contextual information for the next response."
