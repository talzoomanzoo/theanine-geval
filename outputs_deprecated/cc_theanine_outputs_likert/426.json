Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me.\nCo-workers B: That's amazing to hear. Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job.\nCo-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work.\nCo-workers B: It's great to have that kind of positive reinforcement. Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated?\nCo-workers A: Oh yeah, I remember. I was so angry after blowing up that rabbit with the dynamite. But talking it out with you really helped me work through my emotions.\nCo-workers B: That's right. It's important to have someone to talk to when you're feeling overwhelmed or upset.\nCo-workers A: And speaking of talking it out, do you remember when I was a kid and I ran to our parents screaming because of that spider?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. [Co-worker B was nervous about working with Co-worker A because of their talent as an actor.] - (Causes) - [Co-worker B emphasized the importance of learning from mistakes and working together as a team.] - (React) - [Co-worker B acknowledges that some people have fears and suggests finding healthy ways to deal with frustrations.]\n\n2. [Co-worker A and Co-worker B met on a movie set and are now good friends.] - (SameTopic) - [Co-worker A felt remorse for what they did and appreciated Co-worker B's understanding.] - (React) - [Co-worker A has grown as a person and as an artist, learning about empathy and compassion.]\n\n3. [Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.] - (React) - [Co-worker A had a tough week on set, feeling overwhelmed and chaotic.] - (React) - [Co-worker A mentions a past event involving blowing up a rabbit with dynamite, indicating a history of poor coping mechanisms for frustration.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I remember that! It's funny how some childhood fears stick with us. It's great that we can support each other through those moments.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information that contributes to understanding the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures the past interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, demonstrating the evolution of their relationship and highlighting previous instances where Co-worker A was frustrated and benefited from Co-worker B's support. Sentences are structured to showcase causality and the connection between events, such as Co-worker A's growth in dealing with emotions and the effect of their collaboration on set. However, while most sentences are naturally phrased and pertinent to the conversation, a bit more specificity in certain elements (e.g., emotions, outcomes) could have enhanced the context. Overall, the MEMORY is very useful in guiding a language model to generate a contextually appropriate response."
