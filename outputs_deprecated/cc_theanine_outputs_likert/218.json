Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax.\nNeighbors B: What kind of breathing exercise?\nNeighbors A: It's just a simple one, where you inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, and then exhale for eight seconds. I've been doing it every day for the past week and it's made such a difference.\nNeighbors B: That's really interesting. I've heard that breathing exercises can be really helpful for reducing stress and anxiety.\nNeighbors A: Yes, it definitely has helped me with that. Plus, it's something that I can easily do anywhere, whether I'm at home or out running errands.\nNeighbors B: That's great. It's always good to have a simple tool like that to help manage stress. \nNeighbors A: Speaking of managing stress, remember a few years ago when I pushed your shoulder because I wanted you to accept me?\nNeighbors B: Oh yeah, I do remember that. That was a stressful time for both of us.\nNeighbors A: It definitely was. But I'm so glad that we've been able to move past that and have a good neighborly relationship now.\nNeighbors B: Me too. And remember when you found that great park a few years ago?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A showed appreciation for Neighbors B's actions in the neighborhood, leading to Neighbors A being willing to take things slow in their relationship with Neighbors B. This resulted in Neighbors B reassuring Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasizing their current friendship. \nNeighbors A ordered a large cheese pizza with extra sauce for Neighbors B, highlighting the value of their friendship. This conversation transitioned to Neighbor A's daughter starting high school, which has been a significant adjustment for the family.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, that park has been such a peaceful place to unwind. I still go there sometimes to clear my mind.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some sentences that could be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly the themes of past incidents, friendship, and moving past stressful situations. Neighbors A's appreciation for Neighbors B's actions and their willingness to take things slow in their relationship is in line with Neighbors A's acknowledgment of a past stressful incident in the context. Additionally, Neighbors B's reassurance about past embarrassing incidents ties into their conversation about moving past a difficult period. However, the MEMORY also includes details that seem unrelated to the current dialogue, such as the ordering of a cheese pizza and Neighbor A's daughter's transition to high school. These elements are not naturally phrased in a way that clearly builds on or connects with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, reducing the overall helpfulness of the MEMORY."
