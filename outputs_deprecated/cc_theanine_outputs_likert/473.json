    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing!\nNeighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go?\nNeighbors A: I visited Brazil and Peru. The culture and food were incredible.\nNeighbors B: That sounds awesome. I've always wanted to go to Peru to see Machu Picchu.\nNeighbors A: Yes, Machu Picchu is amazing. The view from the top is breathtaking.\nNeighbors B: Have you thought about where you want to go next?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I'm thinking about visiting Australia and Antarctica next. I want to see the Great Barrier Reef and the penguins.\nNeighbors B: Wow, that's quite a contrast. From the hot desert to the cold ice. It must be interesting to experience such different environments.\nNeighbors A: Definitely, that's what I love about traveling. You get to see and experience so much diversity in the world.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A taught the kid the special move and the kid was relieved. Neighbors B agrees to buy candy for the neighborhood kids to make them happy.\nNeighbors A won against a kid in chess using a special move. Neighbors A and B believe in doing nice things for others to bring the community together.\nBoth Neighbors A and B believe in the importance of learning and self-improvement. Neighbors A and B believe in doing nice things for others to bring the community together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains information that is not relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences describe interactions involving teaching chess moves, buying candy, and beliefs about community and self-improvement, which do not relate to the discussion about travel, South America, or future travel plans mentioned in the dialogue. Additionally, the sentences in the MEMORY do not establish a clear connection or development related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, and they do not provide helpful information for generating a proper next response in the conversation. As such, the MEMORY does not aid in continuing the dialogue context and receives a low score."
