Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess.\nClassmates B: Wait, what? You cheated on your taxes? That's not okay.\nClassmates A: I know, I know. I was just really struggling financially and I thought I could get away with it.\nClassmates B: You can't just cheat and hope to never get caught. That's not how it works.\nClassmates A: Remember when we talked about me wanting to become a professional basketball player?\nClassmates B: Yeah, I remember. So, what does that have to do with cheating on your taxes?\nClassmates A: It's just that I feel like I keep hitting roadblocks in my life. Every time I try to move forward, something happens to set me back. It's really discouraging.\nClassmates B: I understand that it can be tough, but cheating isn't the answer. You have to keep working hard and doing the right thing, even when it's hard.\nClassmates A: On a completely different note, do you remember when I got a job at the local grocery store?\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A has a big dream of becoming a professional basketball player and works hard towards that goal. Classmates A believes in hard work and dedication to achieve goals both in basketball and their job. Classmate A is pursuing a dream of becoming a professional basketball player and is working at a grocery store to save up money for training.\nClassmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed. Both classmates have a positive attitude towards each other and their respective goals.\nClassmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed. Classmates A balances their job with basketball practice by scheduling shifts around practice time and requesting time off for games or tournaments.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Classmates B",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I remember when you started working at the grocery store. How's that going for you?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does a decent job of capturing Classmates A's ambition of becoming a professional basketball player and his coordinated effort to save money for training by working at a grocery store. It also accurately portrays Classmates B's supportive role, offering advice to stay focused and seek help when necessary. These aspects align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Classmates A discusses his struggles and aspirations. However, the MEMORY could be more helpful by explicitly connecting these details with Classmates A's challenges, such as cheating on taxes due to financial stress, which would provide a clearer causality or development of past interactions. The repeated mention of Classmates B's advice is unnecessary and does not add new information, causing some redundancy. Overall, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but could be improved by making stronger connections to the specific issues raised in the dialogue."
