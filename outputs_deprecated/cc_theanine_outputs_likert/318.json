Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today?\nCo-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there?\nCo-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done.\nCo-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits. Co-worker B is supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable. Co-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides. \nCo-worker A has been getting written up for being late to work. Co-worker A believes their success as a leader was due to determination and strength of character.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some general context about the relationship between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, such as Co-worker B's concerns about Co-worker A's punctuality, drinking habits, and supportiveness of A's efforts to improve. While this could be useful in understanding the dynamics between the co-workers, it does not specifically relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT discussing a visit to the post office. \n\nThe MEMORY lacks any direct reference to events or topics discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the trip to the post office or feelings towards such errands. The information is more focused on character judgments and work-related punctuality, which, while potentially relevant to general interactions, don't assist in generating the next response related to the post office topic. \n\nHowever, the MEMORY is structured clearly in terms of understanding the ongoing development between the relationship of Co-worker A and B, which could be helpful context in a different dialogue scenario. Therefore, while some parts of the MEMORY may be indirectly useful for understanding character dynamics, it doesnâ€™t significantly contribute to the specific context and conversation at hand."
