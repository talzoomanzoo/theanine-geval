Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today.\nClassmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about?\nClassmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A is also working on an essay about the Industrial Revolution. This dedication to studying hard and taking extra classes to get into a good college caused Classmates A to show up to school in pajamas due to oversleeping after studying late. This incident reminded Classmates B of a funny moment from high school involving Classmates A wearing pajamas to school.\n\nClassmates A is also working on an essay about the Industrial Revolution, which made Classmates B notice Classmates A's improvement and acknowledge their hard work. In response, Classmates B advised Classmates A to consider how others perceive them, especially in situations like applying to college.\n\nClassmates B working on finishing a history project was hindered by Classmates A's past frustration, but Classmates A has learned to channel that energy into studies. This change led Classmates A to be willing to work hard to achieve their dreams and not be afraid to be themselves, embracing their quirks, which their girlfriend appreciates.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fascinating! The history of the pyramids is always so intriguing. Did they mention anything about the theories surrounding how they were built?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some relevant context about Classmates A's dedication to studying, which helps to contextualize their interest in attending the talk about the pyramids. However, it lacks direct information about the talk or their interest in ancient history, which would be more directly helpful for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory does offer insight into Classmates A's character and work ethic, which can enrich the generation of responses with a deeper understanding of their motivations and personality. There are also some references to past interactions and development, such as the incident with pajamas, which could inspire conversational threads. However, the connection between the memories and the dialogue context isn't very strong, leading to a middle-of-the-road score for helpfulness."
