Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message.\nCo-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Co-worker B is supportive and interested in the evidence collected by Co-worker A, which leads to Co-worker B commending Co-worker A for their courage in defending their beliefs. This prompts Co-worker A to agree to be more conscious of how they come across to others in the future. Additionally, Co-worker A shares their experience dealing with challenging clients and emphasizes the importance of communication and setting expectations.\n\n- Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument, sparking Co-worker B to commend Co-worker A for their courage in defending their beliefs. This encourages Co-worker A to be more conscious of how they come across to others in the future. Furthermore, Co-worker A shares their experience dealing with challenging clients and stresses the importance of communication and setting expectations.\n\n- Co-worker B is supportive and interested in the evidence collected by Co-worker A, leading to Co-worker B commending Co-worker A for their courage in defending their beliefs. As a result, Co-worker A is willing to take on the project of building a deck for Co-worker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That dedication to practice really shines through in your speeches. It's impressive how you can make complex topics so relatable and engaging.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information about the relationship and dynamics between Co-workers A and B, such as Co-worker B being supportive and Co-worker A being willing to take on new challenges or projects. However, this information does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around public speaking and Co-worker A's skill in that area. The MEMORY focuses more on a different context, possibly regarding a work-related project or evidence collection, which is not helpful in generating a response relevant to public speaking, as mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the sentences in the MEMORY repeat similar information and do not fully demonstrate a coherent development or causality linked to the public speaking context. Thus, the MEMORY lacks relevance and clarity for generating a meaningful continuation of the given conversation."
