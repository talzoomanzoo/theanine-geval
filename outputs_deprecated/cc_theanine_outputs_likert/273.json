Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Wife, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today.\nWife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that.\nHusband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you.\nWife: You always go above and beyond, dear.\nHusband: It's the little things that count, right?\nWife: Definitely. Speaking of little things, do you remember when you told me about catching the bus just in time a few months ago?\nHusband: Oh yes, I remember. I was so relieved I didn't have to wait in the cold for the next one.\nWife: It's amazing how small moments like that can make such a big difference in our day, isn't it?\nHusband: Absolutely. It's the small moments that make life worth living.\nWife: And speaking of living, you mentioned a while back how involved you are in the different ministries at church.\nHusband: Yes, I'm so grateful for the community and support I've found there. It's helped me grow in my faith so much.\nWife: It's wonderful to see you so passionate and dedicated to something you believe in.\nHusband: And I'm grateful for your support and encouragement in it all.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband finds joy in his friendship with someone he can trust and enjoy spending time with, which the wife appreciates. This connection mirrors the supportive community of believers at church that the husband values and appreciates with his wife by his side.\n2. The husband and wife share the belief that the small moments in life are what truly matter, supporting each other's hobbies and interests, like the husband's love for playing the guitar.\n3. The husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that bring him happiness, emphasizing the significance of appreciating the little things in life, such as making it to the bus on time, a memory shared by the wife.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",
