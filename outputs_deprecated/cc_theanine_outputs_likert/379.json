Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to share something with you. I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend.\nClassmates B: That's really kind of you. What did you do to help?\nClassmates A: She was moving and needed some extra hands to pack up her things and load them onto a truck. So I spent most of the day helping her out.\nClassmates B: Wow, that's really generous of you. I'm sure your neighbor really appreciated it.\nClassmates A: I hope so. I just felt like it was the right thing to do. I know if I were in that situation, I would appreciate any help I could get.\nClassmates B: Absolutely. It's important to be there for each other, especially in tough times.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B has been supportive and helpful to Classmates A, which Classmates A appreciates. Classmates B then advised Classmates A to drive safely to avoid accidents.\n2. Classmates A appreciates the support and friendship of Classmates B, as they value their friendship and feel comfortable talking to each other about anything.\n3. Classmates A and B started as acquaintances and have developed a strong friendship, which Classmates A appreciates. Initially worried about Classmates A going out with friends, Classmates B now values their opinions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Definitely, helping others in need is something we should all strive to do. It's all about making the world a better place one small act of kindness at a time.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY includes relevant background information about the relationship between Classmates A and B, highlighting their supportive and appreciative friendship. This context can aid in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT because it provides insight into the dynamic of mutual support and appreciation that exists between the two classmate speakers. While there isn't a direct reference to the specific incident of helping a neighbor, the sentiment of kindness and support present in memory aligns with the ongoing conversation about helping others and being there for each other. The MEMORY sentences are structured naturally, providing useful cues about the relationship and interactions between the speakers."
