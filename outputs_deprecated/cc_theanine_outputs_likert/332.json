    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going?\nNeighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you?\nNeighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band.\nNeighbors B: Really? You had a band?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, we were called \"The Neighbors A Band.\" We used to play live shows around the city.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A has been dealing with back pain for a few months but sought help from a chiropractor, avoiding surgery. This made Neighbor A look forward to playing with Neighbor B again when feeling better. Consequently, Neighbor A recently moved to London from their current location, where they had to learn how to manage stress.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides minimal relevant information in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context of the conversation involves Neighbor A reminiscing about their past experience in a rock band, while MEMORY focuses on Neighbor A's back pain and recent move to London. The MEMORY is not directly connected to the conversation about the band, and it lacks the development and relevance necessary to aid in generating a response aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Although the memory could indicate potential topics of Neighbor A's personal experiences and changes in their life, it does not build on the past interaction of the conversation regarding the rock band. The details given in MEMORY do not clearly support the development of the conversation present in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, thus limiting its usefulness in this context."
