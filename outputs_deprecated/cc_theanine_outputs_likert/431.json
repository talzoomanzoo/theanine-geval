Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentor, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, have you ever tried to imagine what it would be like to think like someone else?\nMentor: Yes, I have. It's a great way to better understand and empathize with others.\nMentee: That's exactly what I thought. I've been trying to imagine what personY is thinking lately. It's been helping me to understand their perspective a bit better.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentee is currently living in an abusive and controlling cult, so Mentor suggests Mentee volunteer at a local church or religious organization to gain experience, which causes Mentor to become a mentor to help others going through similar situations.\n   \n2. Mentee wants to teach religion to help people find meaning in their lives and make a positive impact, showing gratitude for Mentor's support. \n\n3. After Mentee agrees to try the advice and expresses gratitude towards Mentor, Mentor advises caution and careful planning to avoid raising suspicion from the cult, also warning Mentee to be careful not to be preachy or judgmental while teaching religion.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a great exercise in building empathy and understanding. Putting yourself in someone else's shoes can really open your eyes to different viewpoints.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided contains three distinct pieces of information that could help generate a suitable response in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, its relevance to the current dialogue is moderate at best. \n\n1. The first memory point mentions Mentee’s situation in an abusive cult and Mentor’s advice for volunteering. This could somehow connect to the mentee’s attempt to understand Person Y's perspective, but the connection isn't clear or direct.\n\n2. The second memory piece about Mentee's desire to teach religion and acknowledge Mentor's support provides some context about their relationship, which is helpful. However, the connection to the current dialogue about imagining someone else's thoughts isn't strong.\n\n3. The third memory highlights Mentor's guidance and caution to Mentee, which may be useful for the Mentor to keep in mind if more detailed advice is needed in the present conversation. Still, there isn’t a strong connection to the mentee’s exploration of perspective-taking in others.\n\nOverall, MEMORY provides some relevant context but lacks a cohesive connection to the present DIALOGUE CONTEXT around understanding perspectives, affecting its helpfulness score. Sentences are fairly well-structured and coherent, allowing for easier identification of relevant information by the language model."
