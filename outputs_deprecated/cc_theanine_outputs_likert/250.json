Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\nCo-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while.\nCo-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing?\nCo-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites.\nCo-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it.\nCo-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A and Co-worker B both plan to treat themselves to a nice dinner with their paychecks. Co-worker A suggests celebrating their detective work with drinks after work. Co-worker A is observant and did some research on social media to find out that Co-worker B is married. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n\nCo-worker A and Co-worker B both plan to treat themselves to a nice dinner with their paychecks. Co-worker A suggests celebrating their detective work with drinks after work. Co-worker A enjoys solving puzzles and mysteries, even considering becoming a detective. Co-worker A has a talent for solving puzzles and mysteries.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks, I appreciate your kind words. It was definitely a memorable experience.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provided does not appear to contain any information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around Co-worker A singing at church, while the memory is about planning dinners, drinks, detective work, and personal interests unrelated to singing or performing. The memory details do not help in generating a suitable response based on the conversation about Co-worker A's singing experience. Additionally, the repetition of certain details (e.g., treating themselves to dinner, Co-worker A's detective interest) further detracts from the helpfulness. As such, the memory lacks the natural structure and coherence required to support the interaction development in the dialogue context."
