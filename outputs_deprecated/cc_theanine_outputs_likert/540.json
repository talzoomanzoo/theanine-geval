    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, check out this spot I found to camp out for the night. It's perfect!\nClassmates B: Wow, this view is amazing!\nClassmates A: I know, right? And it's completely level and free of any debris. We won't have to worry about rolling off our sleeping pads or anything like that.\nClassmates B: It definitely looks like a great spot to spend the night. How did you manage to find it?\n\nMEMORY:\n- [Classmates A and B found a perfect camping spot with a great view and level ground, free of debris, ensuring a comfortable night's sleep.]\n- [Classmate A's active involvement in the community inspires them to seek fun and impactful activities, leading to a decision to prioritize self-care in the future.]\n- [Classmate B admires Classmate A's community engagement and stresses the importance of allergy awareness, preparedness, and prevention.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information, particularly the first sentence, which perfectly encapsulates the main points from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about finding a camping spot with a great view and level ground. This gives the language model a clear past interaction regarding the camping scenario. However, the second and third sentences in the MEMORY seem unrelated to the camping context. Although they provide insight into the personalities and interactions of Classmates A and B, they don't directly aid the current dialogue. The MEMORY could be stronger if more content were directly linked to the camping experience rather than diverging into other aspects of the characters' past interactions. Despite this, the unrelated sentences are clearly phrased, making it easy for the language model to differentiate them from contextually beneficial information."
