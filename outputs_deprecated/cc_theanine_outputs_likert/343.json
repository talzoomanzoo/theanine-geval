Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful.\nCo-workers B: Did you make sure to include all the necessary details?\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A took over the family business and made changes to adapt to modern times, which has been doing well recently. This success caused Co-worker A's father to trust them, and now Co-worker A wishes they could be outside on the balcony enjoying the weather and music.  \nCo-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen that they still use and appreciates, leading Co-worker B to thank Co-worker A for the gesture.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about Co-worker A's background, particularly with the family business and their father's trust. However, these details do not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on a written report given to a boss. The second part of MEMORY mentions a pen that Co-worker B appreciates from Co-worker A, showing some past interaction and goodwill between them, but it does not provide specific details helpful for the current conversation about the report. Overall, the MEMORY contains relevant information regarding the dynamic between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, but it lacks a direct connection or relevance to the context of their conversation about the report, thus limiting its helpfulness."
