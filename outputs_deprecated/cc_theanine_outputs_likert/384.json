Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Wife, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway?\nWife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go?\nHusband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe wife supports the husband's goals but wanted to be involved in them. Both the husband and wife are supportive of each other's dreams and aspirations. The husband has long-awaited plans and is finally taking action on them, causing the wife to be disappointed that he didn't wait for her and wanted to be included in his plans. This led to the wife bringing up past disappointment when the husband left without her, breaking a promise to wait for her.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful context that can aid the language model in generating a next response. It highlights the wife's desire to be involved in the husband's plans and her past disappointment when the husband acted without including her. This is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where the husband suggests a weekend getaway and the wife expresses interest. The MEMORY explains the dynamics of their relationship, showing that the wife wishes to be more integrated into the husband's activities, which could influence her dialogue regarding planning the getaway. However, the MEMORY could be more effectively structured; it discusses past events and emotions in a somewhat fragmented manner, which might not make the connections as clear as possible for generating a nuanced response. Nonetheless, it still provides a base understanding of the wife's perspective and past experiences that could inform the dialogue."
