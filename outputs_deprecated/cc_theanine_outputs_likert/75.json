Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret?\nNeighbors B: Of course, what's up?\nNeighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door.\nNeighbors B: Oh, why are you hiding from her?\nNeighbors A: She wants me to go to a family dinner tonight, but I'm too tired and just want to relax at home.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A enjoys trying new things, like new recipes, and Neighbor B offers support and suggests planning a dinner to celebrate Neighbor A's new adventures in learning.\n\nNeighbors A and B joke about the fun aspects of using telekinesis to surprise people, which causes Neighbors A to feel overwhelmed but also excited about their new ability. As a result, Neighbor A is thinking about exploring new skills or hobbies outside of work, such as taking online courses or learning a new language.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some interesting and potentially useful information about Neighbors A and B's past interactions, such as Neighbors A trying new things and Neighbors B being supportive, as well as the mention of joking about telekinesis. However, it does not directly relate to or provide context for the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Neighbors A is hiding from their mom to avoid a family dinner. The information in MEMORY is only loosely connected to the current situation, and these past interactions do not really help Neighbors B generate a relevant or informed response for the current dialogue. While the MEMORY is naturally phrased, it lacks the immediate relevancy and connection to the current context that would make it more helpful."
