Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess.\nClassmates B: Wait, what? You cheated on your taxes? That's not okay.\nClassmates A: I know, I know. I was just really struggling financially and I thought I could get away with it.\nClassmates B: You can't just cheat and hope to never get caught. That's not how it works.\nClassmates A: Remember when we talked about me wanting to become a professional basketball player?\nClassmates B: Yeah, I remember. So, what does that have to do with cheating on your taxes?\nClassmates A: It's just that I feel like I keep hitting roadblocks in my life. Every time I try to move forward, something happens to set me back. It's really discouraging.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A feels nervous when practicing in front of others, but they have a big dream of becoming a professional basketball player and work hard towards that goal. They balance their job with basketball practice by scheduling shifts around practice time and requesting time off for games or tournaments.\n2. Classmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed. Both classmates have a positive attitude towards each other and their respective goals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY is moderately helpful in providing context for the dialogue. The MEMORY reveals important information about Classmates A's dream of becoming a professional basketball player, which is relevant as it is mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Classmates A's struggle to balance their job with basketball practice might relate to their financial struggles mentioned in the current dialogue. Additionally, Classmates B's positive attitude and advice to Classmate A to stay focused and ask for help might provide useful context for Classmates B's responses in the ongoing dialogue. However, the MEMORY does not provide direct context about the cheating incident or the financial struggles that are central to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it only moderately helpful. The MEMORY is phrased and structured well, providing a clear connection between the past interactions, but could include more relevant details related to the current discussion about the tax issue."
