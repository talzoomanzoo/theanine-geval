Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you.\nClassmates B: Oh really? What are they?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmate A encourages Classmate B to initiate conversations and be friendly to make new friends. This causes Classmates B to appreciate Classmates A's gesture of buying coffee. As a reaction, Classmates A agreed to try the suggestion and thanked Classmates B for it, wanting Classmates B to encourage them to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n\n- Classmate A and Classmate B enjoy singing karaoke together and look forward to future outings. They both plan to relax at home later in the day, having had trouble sleeping and trying natural remedies like chamomile tea and lavender oil.\n\n- Classmate A and Classmate B both enjoy socializing and going out to parties together. This shared interest leads Classmates A to be social and enjoy meeting new people, while also considering talking to a therapist or counselor to address past issues.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm thinking about starting a new hobby, maybe painting or cooking classes. I feel like it could be a great way to relax and unwind after a long day.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides helpful insights into the dynamics and interactions between Classmate A and Classmate B. The first memory mentions Classmate A encouraging Classmate B regarding social interactions and contains elements of encouragement for future development, which is somewhat relevant to Classmate A wanting to share exciting future plans in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the phrasing could be clearer and more directly related to the context of the conversation. The second and third memories discuss shared activities and interests, such as singing karaoke and socializing, which, while not directly relevant to the context of discussing future plans, still provide background that could be useful for generating a conversational response. The structure and connection of sentences are adequate, but they do not strongly align with the current context. Overall, the MEMORY provides useful background information, but it lacks a strong, direct connection to the current dialogue setting."
