Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Student, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\nTeacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation?\nStudent: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle.\nTeacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time?\nStudent: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then.\nTeacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going?\n\nMEMORY:\nThe teacher praised the student for their bravery and quick action in the emergency situation, which led to the teacher offering support and reassurance that they are there to talk to. This positive and understanding relationship between the teacher and student is evident.\n\nThe student had a heroic experience at the beach where they saved a young kid from drowning, sparking a desire to spend time with their grandchildren in retirement. Additionally, the student is studying French at college and aims to learn Spanish and German as well.\n\nThe teacher praised the student for their bravery and quick action in the emergency situation, which made the student feel stressed lately, possibly leading to an outburst. As a result, the student wants to visit more often and take the grandkids on trips with their daughter and son-in-law.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "**Helpfulness Score: 2**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe MEMORY contains information about past interactions between the teacher and the student; however, much of it is not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The details about the student's bravery during an emergency situation and their intentions to spend more time with their family, including grandchildren, are not tied directly to the ongoing conversation about the student's language studies and their experience with spicy foods.\n\n1. **Relevance to Context:** The MEMORY does not provide helpful information pertinent to the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Although it mentions the student is studying French and aims to learn other languages, this is only a small portion of the MEMORY and is not directly tied to the conversation about building a tolerance to spicy foods or the current state of the student's language studies.\n\n2. **Structure and Connection:** The MEMORY presents a fragmented view of past events that do not naturally lead or contribute to a deeper understanding of the current dialogue about spicy foods and language learning. The structure does not effectively support causality or development connecting previous events with the current dialogue.\n\n3. **Natural Phrasing:** While the MEMORY does have some sentences phrased well enough to identify their irrelevance, the majority seem to lack coherence in relation to the current dialogue topic.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY's usefulness is limited in aiding the generation of an appropriate next response in the ongoing conversation, indicating improvement in relevance and coherence could be made."
