Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\nCo-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while.\nCo-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing?\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A and Co-worker B are both excited about payday and being able to pay off bills. Co-worker A suggests celebrating their detective work with drinks after work. Co-worker B is married and had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together. \nCo-worker A is described as having \"Sherlock Holmes-like skills\" and enjoys solving mysteries. Co-worker A suggests celebrating their detective work with drinks after work. Co-worker A is observant and did some research on social media to find out that Co-worker B is married. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I sang \"Amazing Grace.\" It was a special moment for me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some information that could potentially be interconnected with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as past interactions and shared activities between Co-worker A and Co-worker B. For instance, the detail about Co-worker A having \"Sherlock Holmes-like skills\" and their penchant for solving mysteries might relate to Co-worker A's singing skills, suggesting that they have various talents or skills. However, most parts of the MEMORY, such as the details about being excited about payday, the hiking trip, and marital status revelations, are not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT concerning Co-worker A's singing at church.\n\nThe memory could provide some foundation for the interaction if the dialogue were to explore Co-worker A's skills, interests, or Co-worker B's surprise in learning about a new aspect of Co-worker A. However, these connections are indirect and not immediately helpful in progressing the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT concerning singing. The information is not presented in a naturally unfolding manner, lacking a clear connection or causality between MEMORY and the current context of conversation. Hence, the rating of 2 reflects the memory's limited helpfulness in generating a relevant, context-aware response for Co-worker A."
