Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate A encourages Classmate B to initiate conversations and be friendly to make new friends. This causes Classmates B to appreciate Classmates A's gesture of buying coffee. In reaction, Classmates A agreed to try the suggestion and thanked Classmates B for it. As a result, Classmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n\n2. Classmate A encourages Classmate B to initiate conversations and be friendly to make new friends. In reaction, Classmates A is social and enjoys meeting new people. This makes Classmates A consider talking to a therapist or counselor to address past issues.\n\n3. Classmate A and Classmate B enjoy singing karaoke together and look forward to future outings. This makes Classmates A want to enjoy treating their friends to coffee, which causes Classmates A and B to have shared memories of buying coffee from Starbucks and enjoying it together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Classmates A",
    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! I can't wait to hear about your exciting plans.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Classmate A having plans for the future. For example, the mention of Classmate A considering talking to a therapist or making efforts to work through their feelings could be relevant to their future plans, suggesting a desire for personal growth and improvement. However, the sentences are not structured in a way that clearly connects these memory snippets to the immediate context of sharing future plans, lacking a direct causality or development in the conversation. The memories about karaoke and coffee outings, while providing a nice background to Classmate A and B's relationship, are not directly relevant to future planning and thus don't significantly aid in generating a response related to the present conversation. Overall, the MEMORY is moderately helpful, with some connection to the intended dialogue but not comprehensively or clearly linked."
