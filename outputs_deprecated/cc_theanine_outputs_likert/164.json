Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentee, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Thank you for finding my glasses for me, Mentor. I always seem to misplace them.\nMentor: Not a problem, Mentee. I'm glad I could help. \nMentee: This actually reminds me of when I was struggling with substance abuse. I would often lose things or forget where I put things because of my drinking. It's amazing how much clearer my mind is now that I'm sober.\nMentor: That's a great observation, Mentee. Sobriety can definitely improve your cognitive abilities and overall wellbeing. It's amazing how much substance abuse can hold us back in life.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentee used to feel overwhelmed but now feels more fulfilled by living in the moment, credits Mentor for their help in achieving sobriety, and expresses gratitude for the support. Mentor is proud of Mentee for making positive changes and taking control of their life.\n   \n2. Mentor advises Mentee to be gentle with themselves when they slip back into old patterns, has been supportive of Mentee's journey to sobriety, and is willing to share their knowledge with Mentee to help them achieve their goals.\n\n3. Mentee used to feel overwhelmed but now feels more fulfilled by living in the moment, found getting sober to be a challenging process but is now proud of their progress. The Mentee is dedicated to their sobriety and believes incorporating yoga into their routine will benefit their mental and physical health.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm grateful for your support, Mentor. It means a lot to have someone who understands the journey to sobriety.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a useful context for understanding the relationship and dynamic between the Mentor and Mentee, particularly in relation to the theme of sobriety, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY highlights the Mentor's support and the Mentee's journey towards sobriety, which echoes the Mentee's reflection on the improvement of their mental clarity. Additionally, there is a development in the Mentee's experience from feeling overwhelmed to feeling fulfilled and grateful, which can help the language model generate responses that acknowledge these past interactions and emotions. However, while the MEMORY is structured and offers some helpful contextual information, there could be clearer connections or expansions in describing how specific past interactions relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT itself to achieve a perfect score of 5."
