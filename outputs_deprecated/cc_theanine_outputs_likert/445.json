Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: It's great to have friends who can help each other out, isn't it?\nNeighbors B: Absolutely. It's a two-way street, and it's important to be there for each other.\nNeighbors A: I remember when I helped you move last year, and then you watched my cat when I went on vacation.\nNeighbors B: Yes, and I appreciate it so much. It's always nice to have someone you can count on.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A stumbled upon Neighbors B's shop while looking for a new necklace and received a suggestion. Neighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the help and now wants earrings for an upcoming wedding. Both neighbors discussed the challenge of not being able to adopt all animals they see but admire those who do, and also agreed on the strength required for apologizing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Definitely, it makes life a lot easier when you know you have someone you can rely on.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY does provide some helpful information, but not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. In the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, the neighbors discuss reciprocal help in a social context, emphasizing mutual support through favors like moving and pet sitting. MEMORY, however, highlights different interactions like shopping for jewelry, animal adoption, and discussing the strength of apologizing. While these past interactions exhibit a positive relationship and shared experiences, only the general theme of cooperation and support is maintained. There is no direct link or clear causality between MEMORY and DIALOGUE CONTEXT, although MEMORY is structured in a way that shows the development of familiarity and mutual respect between the neighbors."
