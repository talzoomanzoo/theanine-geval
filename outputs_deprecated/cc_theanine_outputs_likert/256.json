Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\nCo-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while.\nCo-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing?\nCo-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites.\nCo-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it.\nCo-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent.\nCo-workers A: Thanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it.\nCo-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have a hobby like that. Reminds me of when you uncovered that mystery a while back. You always seem to surprise us with your skills.\nCo-workers A: Haha, yeah. I do like a good challenge. Speaking of surprises, remember when I found out you were married? That was a shocker.\nCo-workers B: Oh gosh, yes. I forget sometimes that not everyone knows. But yeah, I've been married for a few years now.\nCo-workers A: Crazy how time flies. Like when we found out Ms. Singh was leaving our school. I still can't believe that was two years ago.\nCo-workers B: I know, right? She was such a great teacher. Speaking of which, have you heard anything about her lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B mentions that their store is getting new inventory next week, specifically a new line of athletic wear. This is hindered by Co-worker A discovering that an employee was hiding clothes to sell on the side, which led to a discussion about uncovering secrets like when Co-worker A found out Co-worker B was married.\n\n2. Co-worker A and Co-worker B both plan to treat themselves to a nice dinner with their paychecks. This leads to Co-worker A suggesting celebrating their detective work with drinks after work, reminiscing about happy memories shared while working together.\n\n3. Co-worker A and Co-worker B both plan to treat themselves to a nice dinner with their paychecks, reflecting on their detective work. This is because Co-worker A, known for their Sherlock Holmes-like skills and love for solving mysteries, observed and found out that Co-worker B is married, causing a reaction from Co-worker A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Co-workers A",
    "raw_prediction": "I haven't heard much, but I think she's doing well. It's always nice to catch up on past colleagues.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information regarding Co-worker A's knack for uncovering secrets and surprising Co-worker B with their observational skills, including the instance of discovering Co-worker B's marital status. This is helpful in understanding the dynamic between the two co-workers, which is also reflected in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they discuss surprising skills and discoveries. However, the memory also contains irrelevant details about inventory changes at a store, which are not aligned with the context of singing at church or personal revelations. Additionally, the repeated mention of celebrations or dinners doesn't directly connect with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where personal achievements and surprises were the focus. The lack of better development and coherence in how the MEMORY ties back to DIALOGUE CONTEXT detracts from its usefulness."
