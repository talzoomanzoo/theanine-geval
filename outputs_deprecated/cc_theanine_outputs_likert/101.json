Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you.\nClassmates B: Oh really? What are they?\nClassmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners.\nClassmates B: Wow, that sounds amazing! What kind of project are you thinking about?\nClassmates A: I was thinking about starting a marketing agency specialized in social media.\nClassmates B: That's a great idea! I'd love to work with you on that. We could really make a difference in the industry.\nClassmates A: Yes, exactly! And I think our skills complement each other's so well.\nClassmates B: I totally agree. You're so creative and outgoing, while I'm more analytical and detail-oriented.\nClassmates A: It's like we were meant to work together, right?\nClassmates B: Absolutely! I can't wait to see what the future holds for us.\nClassmates A: Me too. And honestly, it's a bit of a relief to finally have a solid plan for the future.\nClassmates B: Yeah, I get that. Speaking of the future, how have you been doing with your sleeping problems?\nClassmates A: It's been a slow process, but I've been making progress with it. I started doing yoga and meditation before bed, and that's been helping a lot.\nClassmates B: That's great to hear. And what about your past struggles with school and friendships? Do you feel like you've moved on from that?\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates B admires Classmates A's outgoing nature and expresses a desire to be more like them. \nClassmates B appreciates Classmates A's gesture of buying coffee and responds positively to it. \nClassmates A agrees to try the suggestion and expresses gratitude towards Classmates B. \nClassmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future. \nClassmates A encourages Classmates B to initiate conversations and be friendly to make new friends. \nBoth Classmates A and B enjoy socializing and going out to parties together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Classmates A",
    "raw_prediction": "I have definitely made progress in those areas too. I've been focusing on building new connections and embracing new opportunities.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of helpful information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, the memory mentions Classmates B's admiration for Classmates A's outgoing nature and their encouragement for each other, which aligns with the dialogue context where Classmates B acknowledges A's creativity and outgoing personality. The memory of Classmates B encouraging A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future connects to Classmates A discussing progress with their sleeping problems and meditation practice in the dialogue. Additionally, the mention that both enjoy socializing is relevant to their positive and collaborative interactions in the context. However, some elements, like buying coffee or specific advice on initiating conversations to make new friends, are not directly relevant to the current dialogue, hence the score is not a perfect 5. Nonetheless, the memory is mostly well-structured and does provide helpful context for the ongoing conversation."
