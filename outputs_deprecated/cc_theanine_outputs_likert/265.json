Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Wife, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today.\nWife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that.\nHusband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you.\nWife: You always go above and beyond, dear.\nHusband: It's the little things that count, right?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both the husband and wife appreciate the little things in life that add up and make life meaningful.\n2. The husband enjoys being outside and loves the weather after being stuck indoors at work. The wife is glad that the husband has a friend he can trust and enjoy spending time with.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, those little touches make all the difference. Thank you for always making our home feel so special.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does provide some relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 1 (\"Both the husband and wife appreciate the little things in life that add up and make life meaningful.\") aligns well with the dialogue context as it reflects the mutual appreciation for the small gestures, like hanging up lights, that create a meaningful atmosphere in their relationship. However, sentence 2 (\"The husband enjoys being outside and loves the weather after being stuck indoors at work. The wife is glad that the husband has a friend he can trust and enjoy spending time with.\") does not directly relate to the current dialogue context and does not contribute to generating the next response. While both sentences are naturally phrased and connected, only one of them directly aids in understanding the context of the conversation about creating a cozy home environment. Therefore, the MEMORY is moderately helpful."
