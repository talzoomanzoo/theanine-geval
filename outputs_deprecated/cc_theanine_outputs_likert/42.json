Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B mentioned helping a customer resolve an issue last week, showing a willingness to assist others. This reminds Co-worker A of the time when Co-worker B was supportive and willing to help in any way. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it. \n2. Co-worker A spoke with the police about the incident and the women involved were thankful. In reaction, Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time. \n3. Co-worker B mentioned helping a customer resolve an issue last week, showing a willingness to assist others. This made Co-worker A remember how brave and strong Co-worker A has been in past situations. This further led to Co-worker B admiring Co-worker A's resilience and positivity, and eventually appreciating Co-worker A's positivity and friendship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provided does not contain information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory primarily focuses on past interactions where Co-workers B has been shown to be helpful or Co-workers A has been appreciated for their resilience. However, there is no clear connection or development that is pertinent to the situation in the dialogue context, where Co-worker A is discussing taking drastic actions regarding a bride. The memories related to helping customers or other scenarios do not lend themselves to generating a coherent or contextually appropriate response to the given dialogue. Additionally, the sentences in the memory are repetitious and do not build upon each other meaningfully to connect to the dialogue context. Therefore, the memory does not enhance the understanding necessary to formulate a response in this context."
