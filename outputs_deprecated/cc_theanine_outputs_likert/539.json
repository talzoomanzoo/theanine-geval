    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, check out this spot I found to camp out for the night. It's perfect!\nClassmates B: Wow, this view is amazing!\nClassmates A: I know, right? And it's completely level and free of any debris. We won't have to worry about rolling off our sleeping pads or anything like that.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmate A hopes to encourage others to get involved and create a ripple effect for positive change, expressing a desire to find alternative ways to have fun and make a positive impact in the community. Additionally, Classmate A agrees to take better care of themselves in the future.\n- Classmates B finds Classmates A's involvement in the community admirable and important, as Classmate B is involved in an action committee working on organizing a community clean-up day. Furthermore, Classmates A was part of an action committee in high school to improve the community.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information about Classmates A and B's involvement in community activities and their shared interest in making a positive impact. However, this information does not appear directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is focused on camping and enjoying the natural setting. The MEMORY does not provide details about the speakers' past interactions related to camping, outdoor activities, or their current situation. Although the sentences in MEMORY are well-structured, they do not help in generating a response that continues the dialogue about the camping scene described in the context. Thus, the MEMORY has limited helpfulness in this scenario."
