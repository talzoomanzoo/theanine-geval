    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I really enjoy being a carpenter. It's a very fulfilling job.\nClassmates B: That's great to hear! How did you get into carpentry?\nClassmates A: My dad was a carpenter, so I grew up around it. I started by helping him out when I was young, and then I began to really enjoy it myself.\nClassmates B: That's awesome that you were able to learn from your dad and turn it into a career. Have you done any big projects lately?\nClassmates A: Yeah, I just finished building a custom bookshelf for a client. It was a challenging project, but I'm really happy with how it turned out.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmate A is interested in entrepreneurship and has signed up for a seminar on starting a business. This has caused Classmate A to attend the seminar and is excited about applying that knowledge to future plans. As a result, Classmate A wants to pursue singing, a passion they never thought possible before.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains information relevant to Classmate A, but it does not directly connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about carpentry. The MEMORY describes Classmate A's interest in entrepreneurship and singing, which are unrelated to the discussion about carpentry and a recent project. The MEMORY does demonstrate causality and development regarding Classmate A's pursuits outside of the carpentry context, but those details don't help in generating a meaningful or relevant response based on the current dialogue. The MEMORY's phrasing is clear and naturally structured, but its lack of connection to the specific topic in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT limits its relevance and usefulness in this evaluation."
