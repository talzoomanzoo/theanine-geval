Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\nCo-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing.\nCo-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Co-worker A is considering seeing a doctor to ensure everything is okay and Co-worker B is supportive and glad that Co-worker A is okay. Co-worker B was surprised to learn about Co-worker A's past struggles.\n- Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A, and Co-worker A is grateful to Co-worker B for letting them borrow the horse and is having a great time riding her. This act changed Co-worker B to be glad to have been able to help Co-worker A and feel the trade worked out well for both of them. Co-worker B is also impressed with Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information about past interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B that illustrate a supportive and helpful relationship, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Co-worker A is offering help to Co-worker B. The mention of Co-worker B's surprise about Co-worker A's past struggles and the supportive nature of their relationship could be helpful contextually to understand the dynamics between the two co-workers. However, details about borrowing a horse and riding it, while showing a positive dynamic, are not directly relevant to the current workload discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY provides some helpful context but has extraneous details not directly pertinent to carrying forward the current dialogue. Overall, it offers some beneficial background, but the relevancy and connection to the specific dialogue context could be stronger."
