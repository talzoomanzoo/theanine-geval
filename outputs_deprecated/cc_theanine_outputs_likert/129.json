Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss!\nCo-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes.\nCo-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan.\nCo-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway.\nCo-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way.\nCo-workers B: And sometimes it is, but we all have different ideas and perspectives to bring to the table.\nCo-workers A: Okay, I see your point. I'll try to be more open-minded in the future.\nCo-workers B: That's all we can ask for. Remember that we're a team and we all have something valuable to contribute.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Co-worker A and Co-worker B share a talent for collaborating well with others and resolving issues, which leads to Co-worker A giving Co-worker B a massage to help them relax.\n- Co-worker A's strong work ethic and positive influence on the workplace are recognized by Co-worker B, emphasizing the importance of communication and understanding in their relationship. This mutual appreciation allows both co-workers to enjoy connecting with each other, making work more enjoyable.\n- Co-worker B's belief that they had permanently lost their watch is overturned when Co-worker A returns it to them, resulting in the repair and rekindling of their friendship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information about the relationship between Co-workers A and B, which can be helpful in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It shows that Co-worker A and B have a collaborative relationship and work well together, which aligns with the context of discussing team dynamics and contributions. However, the MEMORY also includes an unrelated event about Co-worker A returning a watch to Co-worker B, which, although it demonstrates trust and friendship, does not directly pertain to the current conversation about leadership and teamwork. While the MEMORY is generally well-structured and clear, its helpfulness could be improved by focusing more on shared experiences or past discussions that directly address the power dynamics and collaboration discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
