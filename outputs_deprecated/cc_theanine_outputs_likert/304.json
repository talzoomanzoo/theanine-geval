Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins.\nNeighbors B: Oh, okay. I didn't realize there was any confusion about that.\nNeighbors A: Well, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page. I don't want any misunderstandings in the future.\nNeighbors B: I understand. Is there anything else we should do to make sure we're clear about this?\nNeighbors A: I don't think so, but if you have any other suggestions, I'm open to hearing them.\nNeighbors B: No, I think the line is a good idea. It's clear and simple.\nNeighbors A: Great. Hey, speaking of lines and boundaries, remember when we talked about my promotion at work? I had to set some clear boundaries with my team about what I expected from them.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember. How did that go?\nNeighbors A: It was tough at first, but eventually, everyone respected the boundaries I set and our team was more productive because of it.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B, which leads to Neighbor A believing in setting goals, developing a positive attitude, and taking action for personal development and career advancement. This prompts Neighbor A to offer help to Neighbor B in getting into a workout routine. However, this offer is hindered by Neighbor B's counteroffer to be more supportive and check in on Neighbor A more often. \n\nNeighbor A's favorite book is \"The Great Gatsby,\" which influences Neighbor A to focus on setting goals, developing a positive attitude, and taking action for personal development and career advancement. As a result, Neighbor A offers to assist Neighbor B in starting a workout routine. Additionally, Neighbor A tries to work out every morning to relieve stress but finds it challenging to maintain the routine.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! Setting boundaries can definitely lead to a more efficient and effective team dynamic.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some potential insights into the character of Neighbor A, such as their interests in reading, their personal development values, and their workout routine. However, these aspects are not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which centers around property boundaries and work-related boundaries. The MEMORY fails to offer a clear connection or causality related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which limits its helpfulness in generating an appropriate next response for Neighbor B.\n\nWhile the MEMORY is naturally phrased and offers a glimpse into past interactions, it does not effectively support the development of the conversation about boundaries or link to the experience Neighbor A shares regarding their work. Additionally, the MEMORY's repetitive mention of reading, personal goals, and workout routines does not enhance understanding or provide substantial background regarding the current discussion about boundaries or previous interactions between the neighbors in the dialogue context. Thus, it scores a 2 for helpfully providing context relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
