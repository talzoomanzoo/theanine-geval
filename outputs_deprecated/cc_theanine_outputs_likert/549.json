Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today?\nClassmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own.\nClassmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others.\nClassmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmates A and B enjoy playing music together, plan to collaborate in the future, and have a supportive relationship.\n- Classmates A and B are both dedicated to their math class homework and share a passion for music.\n- Classmates A and B are excited about their new red sports cars and plan to celebrate with a drink.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I get that. Just know that I'm here for you if you ever need help or support.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some insight into the relationship between Classmates A and B, highlighting their common interests in music and math, as well as their supportive dynamic. This information partially aligns with the supportive tone present in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY does not directly address the specific concern mentioned by Classmate B about feeling like a burden, nor does it establish a direct link to the current issue of frustration and dependency. While the shared interests and supportive relationship may be helpful contextual cues for generating a future response, there is a lack of direct relevance to the immediate emotional concern mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
