    "raw_prediction": "Speaker B: I understand that you may not be a big fan of cats, but it's important to find a loving home for them if you decide not to keep them. It would be best to make sure they are well taken care of and not mistreated. Maybe you can reach out to a local shelter or rescue organization to help with rehoming them properly. It's important to prioritize the well-being of the cats above all else.",
