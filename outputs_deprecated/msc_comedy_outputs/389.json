It must be exciting to see people's reactions to your art. Hopefully, the administrators will come around and appreciate the creativity behind it.\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I hope so too.

Keep up the good work, and maybe one day your art will be officially commissioned!\n\nSpeaker A: Thanks, that means a lot coming from you. It's always encouraging to hear positive feedback.
