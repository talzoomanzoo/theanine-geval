    "raw_prediction": "Speaker A: Yes, I make sure to keep all my chemicals and medications locked up securely. I would hate for Bandicoot to get into anything harmful. And when I drive, I always keep him in a cage to ensure both of our safety. It can be quite dangerous if he starts wandering around in the car while I'm driving. Thank you for the reminder. \nSpeaker B: That's great to hear that you're taking precautions to keep Bandicoot safe. It's always important to be mindful of potential dangers, especially when it comes to curious pets like raccoons. If you ever need more advice or assistance with handling raccoons, feel free to reach out. And if you ever decide to adopt a bearded dragon or any other pet, I'm here to help with that too.",
