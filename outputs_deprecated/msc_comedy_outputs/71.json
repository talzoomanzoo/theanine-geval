They're one of my favorite bands to listen to while relaxing by the ocean.\n\nSpeaker B: Oh yes, I love Sublime! Their music really sets the mood for a day by the beach. I can't wait to teach you some fishing tips when we go out together, maybe we can even try to catch a trout like the one I caught recently.\n\nSpeaker A: That sounds amazing, I'm really looking forward to our fishing trip! And maybe after that, you can teach me a bit about rock music, I'd love to learn more about your favorite bands like Aerosmith.",

None of those memories seem directly related to the question of what instrument Speaker A plays.\n\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
