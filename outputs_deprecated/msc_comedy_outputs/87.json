    "raw_prediction": "Response: That's great to hear that your family is doing well and that you had a fun time at the park with your grandkids. My family is good, thank you for asking. I wish I could spend more time with them, but work keeps me occupied. I've been trying to get my youngest interested in playing the flute, it's something I really enjoy. It's nice to see how our families are growing and changing over the years.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT does not specifically require past information for response generation. The question is about the use of technology to communicate with grandkids, which doesn't necessitate background or event details from MEMORY.\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
