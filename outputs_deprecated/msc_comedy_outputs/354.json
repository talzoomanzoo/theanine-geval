And yes, we had a blast water skiing last weekend. I can't wait for the next time we can all hit the water together. And who knows, maybe one day we can all go boating together too!",

While the memory provides information about Speaker A's favorite jello flavors and their tradition of making jello, it does not directly relate to Speaker B, who is the one teaching the recipe in the provided context. The context is about Speaker B's personal experience, and Speaker A's past experiences or preferences are not necessary for generating a response based on this specific context.\nJudgement: No"
