    "raw_prediction": "Speaker A: I appreciate how having snakes like Hensel and Gretel aligns with my interest in neuroscience. Their behavior and unique biology offer a fascinating perspective on the nervous system. Plus, their low maintenance allows me to focus on my research and volunteer work without worrying about their care. It's a perfect balance for me.",

The MEMORY provided contains information about Speaker A and Speaker B's interests, passions, and experiences, none of which mention snakes or pets. Therefore, the MEMORY does not contain helpful past information for generating a response about the pet snakes.\n\nJudgement: No"
