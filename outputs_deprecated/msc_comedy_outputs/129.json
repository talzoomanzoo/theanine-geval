    "raw_prediction": "Speaker A: I can't wait to see the Dojo tomorrow! I'm really excited to learn more about karate. By the way, have you seen any good foreign language movies lately? I recently watched \"The Life Ahead\" and loved it!\n\nSpeaker B: That's awesome! I haven't seen that movie yet, but I'll definitely check it out. I'm glad you're interested in karate, it's such a cool martial art to learn. Let's grab lunch at the new sandwich shop by the college after our visit to the Dojo tomorrow. And I'll bring those guest passes to the pool as well!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves a question about studying other martial arts. The MEMORY contains information about Speaker B's interest in karate, which could be relevant. However, the memory does not provide direct information about other martial arts or Speaker B's experiences with them, which is what the question might be aiming towards. Nevertheless, it does indicate Speaker B's general interest in martial arts.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
