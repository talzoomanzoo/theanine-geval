    "raw_prediction": "Response: I completely understand where you're coming from. There's something special about the simplicity of a phone call that can't be replaced by text messages. Speaking of parks, I had a wonderful time with my grandkids at the park recently. It's moments like those that make me appreciate the beauty of spending time with family.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context is about the use of technology, particularly text messaging, to interact with grandkids. The memory primarily contains information about Speaker B's family life, profession, interests, and previous interactions with Speaker A, but nothing specifically about their use of text messaging or technology to communicate with their grandchildren.\nJudgement: No"
