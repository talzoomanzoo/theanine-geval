    "raw_prediction": "Speaker B: I'm not married, but I have a partner who was definitely shocked when she saw the picture of that massive muskie I caught in Michigan. She couldn't believe it! But yeah, I definitely agree with you about discussing big decisions like tattoos with your significant other. It's always better to be on the same page. And hey, speaking of fishing, when are we planning our next trip off the California coast? I can't wait to explore those beautiful spots we talked about!",

The memory content mainly pertains to fishing, travel, and shared plans, rather than anything directly relevant to the tattoo discussion.\nJudgement: \"No\""
