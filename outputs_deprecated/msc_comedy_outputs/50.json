    "raw_prediction": "Speaker B: It's great to hear that you find therapy in riding your horses. It's important to find what works for you to address any unresolved issues. And yes, therapy can have an end point, depending on the goals you set and achieve. If you're open to it, I would be happy to work with you and support you through your journey.",

The MEMORY contains information about Speaker B, including how long they have been practicing. While it does not directly address how they decided to become a therapist, it could provide context for their career choice and approach to therapy. Therefore, the MEMORY contains relevant background information that could help in formulating a response.\nJudgement: Yes"
