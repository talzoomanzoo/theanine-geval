    "raw_prediction": "Response: I suggest trying out some action-adventure games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or Super Mario Odyssey. They are both immersive and fun to play, and they might be a nice change of pace from the horror games you're used to. As for me, I enjoy playing games like Mario Kart or Animal Crossing on rainy days. It's a nice way to relax and unwind. And yes, I'm familiar with Ring Fit Adventure! It's a great way to stay active when you've been sitting for too long. Let's plan a gaming session soon and maybe we can try out some new games together.",

This could provide context for Unknown to generate a more personalized and appropriate response regarding whether Speaker B has played Resident Evil this week. \n\nJudgement: Yes"
