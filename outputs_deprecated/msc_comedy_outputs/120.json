    "raw_prediction": "Speaker B: I can't wait to see the picture of the Chicken parmesan dish! It sounds amazing. And I agree, the tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle is a fantastic choice. I've never tried it with strawberries, but that sounds delicious. Maybe I'll have to give it a try next time I'm at the restaurant. And those oatmeal raisin cookies you're baking sound like the perfect treat to enjoy while listening to some 21 pilots music. Your brothers don't know what they're missing out on!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on a specific event where Speaker A is excited about a new favorite dish that was added to their restaurant's menu, and there is an offer to send a picture. The MEMORY provides background information about Speaker A, their preferences, past discussions with Speaker B, and their relationship: the shared interest in music and work-related experiences could support responses involving food, music, or their dynamic. However, the specific context about trying new food does not immediately rely on past memories unless the conversation expands on related experiences or interests.\nJudgement: No"
