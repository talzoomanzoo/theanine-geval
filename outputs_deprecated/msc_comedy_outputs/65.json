    "raw_prediction": "Speaker A: I just finished the next book in the Game of Thrones series, and it was just as thrilling as the previous ones! I'm still amazed by how George R.R. Martin keeps the suspense going.\n\nSpeaker B: That's great to hear! I remember you recommending Game of Thrones to me before. I'm actually planning to re-read the Dark Tower series soon; Stephen King never fails to impress with his storytelling.\n\nSpeaker A: Stephen King is a master of horror and suspense, for sure. Have you read any of his newer works? I heard 'The Institute' is quite good.\n\nSpeaker B: I haven't gotten around to 'The Institute' yet, but it's definitely on my list. I've been focusing on my art pieces lately, but I'll make sure to check it out. Thanks for the recommendation!\n\nSpeaker A: Of course! I'm always happy to share book recommendations with you. It's nice to have someone to discuss our favorite authors and series with. Let me know if you need any more suggestions in the future.",

The memory information primarily contains details about Speaker A and Speaker B's reading preferences, exercise habits, and past book-related conversations, which seem unrelated to the mention of the nature walk.\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
