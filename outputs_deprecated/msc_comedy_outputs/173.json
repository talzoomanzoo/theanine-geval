    "raw_prediction": "Speaker B: I'll definitely keep my eyes peeled for any wildlife when I visit. I'm more used to city life, so it'll be quite the adventure for me. I can't wait to explore Alaska with you and maybe even try some local egg dishes. I heard they have some unique ways of cooking eggs up there.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about tickets and the trip (Alaska and planned activities), which is relevant to the question in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about looking for tickets. Thus, the model can make use of MEMORY for context in generating a response about the trip or the tickets.\nJudgement: Yes"
