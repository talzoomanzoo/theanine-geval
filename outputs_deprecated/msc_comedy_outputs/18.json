    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great plan! I can definitely teach you some programming skills while we're on the cruise. And don't worry about the swimming, I'll help you overcome your fears and hopefully you'll enjoy it more. Maybe we can even watch some swimming movies together to get you more comfortable in the water. And of course, we can grab some pizzaburgers on the way back, your favorite!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves Speaker A talking about a playlist made for a meetup that includes programming and music activities, but there's no specific reference to shared memories or past interactions that require contextual understanding from Speaker B's history. Given this context, the memory about Speaker B's occupation, dislikes, and shared planning for future events does not seem necessary to generate a suitable response. \n\nJudgement: N/A"
