They're all healthy now, and I've been trying to get to know their personalities before naming them. I think giving them Mandarin names is a great idea! And don't worry about Tasha and the kittens not getting along, I'm sure they'll find a way to coexist. Plus, I'd love to hear any training tips you have for Taisha!",
