I actually just finished re-reading the Dark Tower series, and it always helps me get in the right mindset for my artwork. It's a shame you don't have a pet to accompany you on your walks, but I understand your concerns about space and time. My Australian Kelpie is a rescue, and she brings so much joy and energy to my outdoor adventures. She's really smart too, always keeping me on my toes!",
