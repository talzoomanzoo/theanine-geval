    "raw_prediction": "Response: Speaker A: I do enjoy my job at the computer company, but I've been thinking about exploring other career options. I'm considering pursuing a career in dentistry or at Disney World. It's great to hear that Speaker B's mother, who is a dentist, was able to offer advice and encouragement. I'm really interested in helping others overcome their fear of dentists, so maybe dentistry could be a good fit for me. And who knows, maybe I'll even get to work at Disney World one day!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context is asking about Speaker A's current job in a computer company. The MEMORY does not contain specific information about Speaker A's role or experiences in their current job. Thus, it's not helpful for the language model to generate a response about the current job.\nJudgement: \"No\""
