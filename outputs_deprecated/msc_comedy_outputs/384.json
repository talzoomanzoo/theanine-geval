    "raw_prediction": "Speaker B: I've actually been thinking about getting a tattoo related to my love for fishing. Maybe a symbol of a fish or a fishing rod. It would be a great way to honor my passion for the sport. And I'll definitely have to get permission from my wife too, just like you!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about Speaker A considering a new tattoo for their mom. While the MEMORY contains some relevant information about Speaker A saving up for a tattoo of their father's face, it does not address the idea of a tattoo for the mother or opinions on such a theme. Therefore, the MEMORY is not helpful in generating a response about this specific tattoo.\nJudgement: No"
