I've been at my computer company for about four years now, but I feel the need for stability for my family's sake. It's definitely a stressful industry in flux, and I'm hoping to stay put until my child graduates from kindergarten. Have you ever considered working at Disney World? I know you've mentioned your interest in finding a career that truly makes you happy, and I think you would be a great fit there. Plus, your love for cooking could definitely come in handy in the magical world of Disney!",
