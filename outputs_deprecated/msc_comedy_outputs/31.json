    "raw_prediction": "Speaker A: I can't wait to try your chili dog casserole at the diner! It sounds delicious. And I'm so excited to see you continue your studies in molecular biology. Have you thought about how cloning could be used in neuroscience research?\nSpeaker B: Thank you! I'm glad you're excited to try it. And that's a great idea about using cloning in neuroscience research. I haven't really thought about it, but it's definitely something worth exploring. Maybe I can incorporate that into my future studies!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT refers to the cloning of a cow, which intersects with Speaker B's interest in molecular biology as described in MEMORY. This past information could be relevant to discussing the continuation in the lab when they clone the cow, demonstrating an overlap in interests and potential involvement. \n\nJudgement: Yes"
