I love being outdoors and sharing my passion for nature with others. It's just a dream for now, but who knows what the future holds. And speaking of outdoor adventures, I can't wait for our hike this weekend! I've packed some delicious veggie sandwiches and fruit for our picnic at the top of the mountain. And maybe we can even take a dip in the lake to cool off. Oh, and I have to tell you, my dog absolutely loves the hammock that John sells. He's always trying to steal it from me when we're camping!",
