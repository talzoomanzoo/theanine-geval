    "raw_prediction": "Speaker A: I love the idea of adding vibrant colors to create a hippy feel in your living room! It sounds like it will be a cozy and inviting space. As for patio furniture, an umbrella table with chairs or a screened-in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle would be perfect for enjoying the outdoors. And I'll definitely bring the corn for the barbecue, along with some Miranda Lambert songs on the guitar! I can't wait to see how your house turns out.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT includes Speaker A offering to play guitar during their planned barbecue meeting with Speaker B. The MEMORY contains information about their shared interest in grilling and barbecuing, but it doesn't provide any relevant past information related to playing the guitar or their musical interests. The MEMORY mainly discusses furniture, grilling preferences, and plans to meet, which are not directly relevant to the guitar playing aspect of the conversation.\n\nJudgement: No"
