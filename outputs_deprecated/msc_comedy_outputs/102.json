    "raw_prediction": "Response: Yeah, I heard about the whole daylight and darkness thing in Alaska too! It's called the midnight sun phenomenon, where they have daylight for months at a time. It's definitely a unique experience to witness. And don't worry about the cold during camping, you can always bring your coding skills to automate a heating system or something! And I'm sure you'll find some delicious ice cream to enjoy while you're there, maybe even come up with a new ice cream flavor based on your coding expertise!",

The MEMORY contains specific past conversations related to planning the Alaska trip, including activity preferences like fishing, hiking, and avoiding mosquitoes. This information can help Unknown generate a response that aligns with Speaker B's interests and previous discussions.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
