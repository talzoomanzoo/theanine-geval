    "raw_prediction": "Response: I think it's great that you invited your friend to join you on your trip! Having someone familiar with the area will definitely make your adventure more enjoyable. Since you're good at coding and automating systems, maybe you could create a bear repellent device to bring along with you just in case. It might come in handy if you encounter any grizzlies during your hikes. And don't worry, I'm sure your friend will have plenty of insight on local customs and outdoor safety tips. Have a fantastic time in Alaska and make sure to share your coding skills with the bears if they get too close!",
