    "raw_prediction": "Speaker A: It's definitely eye-opening when you start to pay attention to the ingredients in desserts. Maybe you could try experimenting with some healthier alternatives, like using natural sweeteners or fruits instead of sugar. \n\nSpeaker B: That's a good idea, I'll have to look into that. I do love a good juicy steak though, nothing beats that. And speaking of food, have you ever tried making jello with fresh fruit instead of the sugary mix-ins? It's a refreshing twist on a classic recipe.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains past information about the relationship and exchanges between Speaker A and Speaker B, specifically related to jello and family dinners, which directly connects to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about teaching kids a jello recipe. This indicates that past information about jello (Event Description point 4 and 5) is relevant for generating a proper response.\nJudgement: Yes"
