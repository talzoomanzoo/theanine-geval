    "raw_prediction": "Speaker B: I've actually been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash, which is working out pretty well for me. It's nice to have some extra money coming in, especially when you're in between jobs. And you're right, it's a win when it's under the table and you don't have to worry about taxes. As for my career aspirations, I've always been drawn to the idea of working in a field where I can make a difference in people's lives, maybe something related to community outreach or social services. What about you? Have you thought about what you'd like to do career-wise after your cross-country journey?",
