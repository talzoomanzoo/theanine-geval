    "raw_prediction": "Speaker B: Don't worry, I'll make sure the yodeling marathon training sessions are worth it! Maybe we can incorporate some musical elements into our runs to keep things interesting. And hey, if you need a break from the early morning motivational quotes, just let me know. We're in this together, remember?",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves Speaker A asking about a motivational speaker to motivate a friend to run again. The memory includes information about Speaker A's background, relationship with Speaker B, and shared experiences, but it doesn't specifically identify a motivational speaker or someone who could motivate another to run. Thus, the memory doesn't directly help answer the immediate inquiry.\nJudgement: No"
