Maybe we can even rock out to some 21 pilots while you enjoy it on your next shift. Your positive attitude towards trying new things always inspires me.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about Speaker A expressing excitement about trying a new dish added to their work menu. This context does not necessitate recalling specific past interactions or shared events between Speaker A and Speaker B to generate the next response. The MEMORY contains details about Speaker A's personal interests and past events but doesn't contain specific information on the new dish or recent changes in the menu at work. Thus, recalling past information isn't required for the continuation of this conversation.\nJudgement: N/A"
