I'll have to use my coding skills to set up some automated reminders for when it's time to sleep! And I'll make sure to pack some warm essentials for the cold weather. As for the ice cream, I'll definitely take some pictures and share them with you. And don't worry, I'll keep an eye out for bears while I'm there - hopefully they won't be interested in me!",
