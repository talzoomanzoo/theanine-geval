And definitely go for the tres leches cake with fresh strawberries - it sounds like a perfect choice. Maybe we can grab dessert together sometime and chat about our favorite old bands like Styx and Journey!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about Speaker A being excited about a dish at the restaurant where they work and planning to send a picture to Speaker B. The MEMORY contains information about Speaker B's interests and past events concerning Speaker A, such as free meals at the restaurant, but it does not specifically relate to the addition of a favorite dish to the menu. The MEMORY information about free meals could be slightly relevant, but it isn't necessary for generating a response to this specific dialogue context.\n\nJudgement: No"
