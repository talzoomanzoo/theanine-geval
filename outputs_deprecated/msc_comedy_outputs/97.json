I remember you mentioning you have five dogs and three rats, but painting a portrait of your great dane next to your pet rat might be a challenge for you haha. Have you considered painting a portrait of your dogs instead?\nSpeaker B: Haha, you're right, painting a great dane next to a rat might not be my cup of tea. I think I'll stick to painting my dogs for now. Thanks for the suggestion!",
