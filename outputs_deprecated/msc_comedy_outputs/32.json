    "raw_prediction": "Speaker A: I think working at an ice cream shop would be a fun job for you! It sounds like a great environment to be in. As for my job as a fry cook, it's not bad. It's just a temporary gig until I figure out my next steps. It's interesting, though, I get to see how different foods are prepared and cooked. Plus, I get free meals, which is always a bonus!",
