    "raw_prediction": "Response: \n\nThat's awesome that you're planning to take your pet snakes with you to your off-campus place! It must be nice to have them around while you're studying. As for me, I can relate to wanting your own space for less drama and more freedom. It sounds like you have a lot of interesting experiences and passions, especially with your neuroscience and scuba diving interests. Have you thought about combining those interests in any way for your future career goals?",
