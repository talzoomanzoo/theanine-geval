    "raw_prediction": "Response: I totally get you on avoiding the bugs in the summer! Maybe we can plan a cruise trip together sometime. It sounds like it would be more up your alley than hiking in the woods. I'll make sure to pack extra bug repellent just in case!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The context revolves around Speaker A discussing preparations for repelling mosquitos, likely in anticipation of an outdoor activity. Memory provides some related information about Speaker B's strong dislike for mosquitos and usage of sprays, as well as Speaker B's general dislike for the outdoors. This information could help Unknown generate a response that acknowledges Speaker B's preference and connects with the current conversation topic.\nJudgement: Yes"
