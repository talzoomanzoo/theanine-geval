    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT inquires if Speaker A interacts with their grandkids using technology, particularly text messaging. The MEMORY confirms that Speaker A has grandkids, but it does not provide specific information on their use of technology or text messaging to interact with them. Therefore, while the MEMORY contains relevant background information about Speaker A having grandkids, it lacks specific details about their communication methods with them, which would have been helpful in this context.\nJudgement: No"
