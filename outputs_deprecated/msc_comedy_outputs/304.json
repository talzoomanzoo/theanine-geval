    "raw_prediction": "Speaker A: When it comes to healing vegetables, I think dark leafy greens like kale and spinach are fantastic options. They are packed with nutrients and antioxidants that are great for the body. As for vegetables to avoid, I would say maybe stay away from processed and fried foods, as they can be harmful to your health in the long run. What are your thoughts on that?",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMEORY contains past events and activities shared between Speaker A and Speaker B, such as enjoying movies together. Given the current context where Speaker A talks about their experience watching the Black Widow movie, the MEMORY may be helpful for Unknown to generate a response relating to similar shared experiences or interests, which aligns with the friendly and interactive relationship they have. Hence, MEMORY may help Unknown generate a response acknowledging this shared enjoyment or suggesting another activity or experience.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
