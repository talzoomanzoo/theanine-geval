    "raw_prediction": "Speaker A: Thank you for offering to help at the library, I might take you up on that offer sometime. It's great to see your passion for books and libraries.\nSpeaker B: Absolutely, anytime you need a hand just let me know. I love being surrounded by books and helping out. And speaking of books, have you thought about taking your grandkids to the library sometime? It could be a fun outing for them.\nSpeaker A: That's a great idea, I think they would really enjoy exploring the library and picking out some new books to read. I'll definitely plan a trip soon. Thank you for the suggestion!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The context involves a question about using technology to interact with grandkids. The memory does not directly address technology usage like text messaging with grandkids. It's more focused on past activities and mutual interests related to being a librarian, without explicit mention of technology. Thus, the memory doesn't contain helpful past information for generating a response to this specific question.\nJudgement: No"
