    "raw_prediction": "Response: Thanks for the encouragement, I really appreciate it. I'll try my best to balance everything. And I totally get what you mean about not wanting to eat a hamburger from a cloned cow. It's definitely a strange concept to think about. Maybe we can stick to our usual burger joints for now.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The question posed by Speaker A about continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow could relate to Speaker B's night job cooking hamburgers and feeding lab rats at a research lab. This makes it plausible that the MEMORY provided could include relevant and helpful past information about Speaker B's experience and role at the lab. \n\nJudgement: Yes"
