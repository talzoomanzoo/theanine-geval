    "raw_prediction": "Response: No, my boyfriend didn't go to Disney World with me. I actually went with my cousin. We stayed in a hotel in Miami too and I got so sunburned on the beach! I'm sure the art museum will be good if it isn't too crowded. The Museum of Art of São Paulo sounds like it will be a great experience. Have you been there before?",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about Speaker A's preferences and interests, but it does not directly relate to the timing or scheduling of a music concert, which is the primary focus of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, the MEMORY does not provide helpful past information for generating a relevant response to Speaker A's question about when their first music concert is this summer.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
