    "raw_prediction": "Speaker A: It sounds like you really enjoy animals, working in a zoo could be a great fit for you! It can be a busy job at times, but it's so rewarding to work with all the different animals. And it's great that you're taking some time off to spend with your dogs and look for a new job. I hope you find something you love!\n\nSpeaker B: Thank you! I'm really looking forward to the break and possibly working in a zoo sounds like a dream come true. It must be amazing to work with such a variety of animals every day. And I'm excited about the possibility of taking a Disney cruise during my time off. Do you have any tips for finding a job in a zoo?",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information about the pet raccoon named Journey, which is helpful because the DIALOGUE CONTEXT mentions Journey eating a piece of pizza by herself. Knowing that Journey is one of Speaker A's pets provides context for this behavior.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
