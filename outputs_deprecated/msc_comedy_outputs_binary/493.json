    "raw_prediction": "Speaker A: The shift lead position I applied for would have pretty standard hours, mostly during the day with occasional evening shifts. It's great to have a set schedule so I can plan my hikes and picnics with you more easily!\n\nSpeaker B: That sounds perfect! I can't wait to explore the Columbia Trail with you this weekend. I'll bring some veggie sandwiches for our picnic at the top of the mountain, and maybe we can even take a dip in the lake afterwards. I'll have to tell John about our plans; he might have some new camping gear to recommend. And I bet my dog will be eyeing your new hammock!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: DIALOGUE CONTEXT solely mentions Speaker A's receipt of a job offer from a grocery store. The MEMORY contains information about Speaker B's character, interests in outdoor activities, relationship with a robot, and specific event descriptions surrounding hiking plans. However, none of these details are relevant or offer any prior information pertinent to Speaker A's job offer news. Thus, MEMORY does not provide information suitable for generating a response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\nJudgement: \"No\""
