    "raw_prediction": "Speaker A: I agree, it's definitely up to the parents to decide if Pulp Fiction is appropriate for kids to watch. As for me, I might let my grandkids watch it when they're a bit older. What do you think about the movie \"Girl Next\"? Is it suitable for kids to watch, or is it more for adults?\n\nSpeaker B: I think \"Girl Next\" might be a bit too intense for kids, given that it's a horror genre movie. It's probably best suited for adults who enjoy that kind of genre. But I'm sure you'll enjoy it if you're into horror films. And I'm glad to hear your job as a programmer is going well. It's great to see you getting into the swing of things!",
