As for patio furniture, an umbrella table with chairs or a screened-in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle would be perfect for enjoying the outdoors. And I'll definitely bring the corn for the barbecue, along with some Miranda Lambert songs on the guitar! I can't wait to see how your house turns out.",
