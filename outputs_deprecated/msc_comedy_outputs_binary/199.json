    "raw_prediction": "Response: I do miss playing soccer in college, but watching games on TV helps me relive those moments. By the way, I'll text you Cynthia's number later for career advice. Also, I heard about your soccer tournament, good luck! And I'll make sure not to bring any spiders near you, knowing we both have arachnophobia.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context is about a particular soccer position Speaker A played in college. The MEMORY primarily contains information about Speaker B's career, interests, fears, and some shared discussions. None of these details provide any past information specifically related to soccer or to Speaker A's experiences or positions played in college. There is no evidence in MEMORY that could aid in generating a response relevant to the question posed about Speaker A's college soccer history.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
