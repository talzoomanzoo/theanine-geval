    "raw_prediction": "Speaker A: I can imagine having a city and country house would be the best of both worlds for you. You could enjoy the peacefulness of the country while still having the convenience of the city at your fingertips.\n\nSpeaker B: Absolutely, it would be a dream come true for me. Fresh produce, fresh air, and the culture of the city whenever I want it. It sounds perfect.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY provides insights into Speaker B’s preferences and lifestyle, but it doesn’t directly relate to or provide context for Speaker A's statement about buying an expensive iPhone. The MEMORY describes Speaker B’s city/country lifestyle balance, music preference, and lottery activities, which does not contribute to the conversation about purchasing an iPhone.\nJudgement: \"No\""
