Maybe it's because they're more independent and have their own unique personalities. Plus, I've heard that having a cat can be relaxing after a long day at work. But hey, maybe I should try volunteering at an animal shelter and see if puppies can win me over! And speaking of trying new things, have you ever grilled Mexican food? I heard it's delicious!",
