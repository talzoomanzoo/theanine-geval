I definitely don't want any raccoons getting into my pantry like that. I'll definitely look into contacting animal control to see if they can help relocate them to a safer area. Thanks for all the insight on caring for raccoons, it's really interesting.\"",

It indicates that Speaker B is knowledgeable about raccoons and their behavior, making the information in MEMORY directly applicable to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
