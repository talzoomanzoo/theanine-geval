    "speaker": "Unknown",
    "raw_prediction": "Speaker A: I actually find the work I do quite fascinating, troubleshooting between hardware and software. It's like solving a puzzle every day. And it's great to hear that you love your job too. It's important to find something you're passionate about, just like how you mentioned your mother, who is a dentist, encouraged me to pursue my interests.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY highlights Speaker A's career considerations, especially towards switching jobs to either Disney World or dentistry, due to a supportive conversation with Speaker B and their mother. Though personally enriching, none of this directly addresses Speaker A's current opinions on building computers or programming, which is the main inquiry from Speaker B in the dialogue context.\nJudgement: No"
