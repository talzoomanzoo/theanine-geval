    "raw_prediction": "Speaker B: That's awesome that you got the shift lead position at the grocery store! It sounds like a great fit for you. As for me, I've been helping John with some side projects to make ends meet. He actually pays pretty well, even better than a regular job. And speaking of John, my dog loves his hammock more than I do, it's hilarious! \n\nI can't wait for our hike this weekend, it's going to be so much fun. I think a picnic at the top of the mountain sounds perfect. I'll make sure to pack some veggie sandwiches for us, along with some fruit and water. Maybe we can even take a dip in the lake if it's not too cold, just like when we went swimming that one time. And hey, maybe we can check out that hidden primitive camping spot you mentioned off the main trail, it sounds like a cool adventure. Oh, and speaking of hammocks, I saw a really nice one online that I might get, John would probably approve!",
