    "raw_prediction": "Speaker A: I can't wait to try your chili dog casserole at the diner! It sounds delicious. And I'm so excited to see you continue your studies in molecular biology. Have you thought about how cloning could be used in neuroscience research?\nSpeaker B: Thank you! I'm glad you're excited to try it. And that's a great idea about using cloning in neuroscience research. I haven't really thought about it, but it's definitely something worth exploring. Maybe I can incorporate that into my future studies!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information about Speaker B's plans to clone a jersey cow, which directly relates to Speaker A's question about continuing to work in the lab for the cow cloning. This suggests that MEMORY contains helpful information for generating a response about the cow cloning discussion.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
