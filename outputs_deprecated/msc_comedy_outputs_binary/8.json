    "raw_prediction": "Speaker A: Your nephew sounds like a character with his green hair! It must be fun to see him express himself creatively. Speaking of hair, I recently dyed my hair turquoise with the help of my grandchildren. They had a blast doing it! I'm considering trying out purple or blue next. It's great to have family members who support our choices, like your daughter with her cosmetology passion. \n\nSpeaker B: That's so cool that you dyed your hair turquoise! I bet purple or blue would look fantastic on you as well. It's wonderful to have family who are supportive and encouraging. Do you have any book recommendations for a beach visit? I'm always looking for new reads to enjoy while relaxing by the ocean.",

The MEMORY mainly focuses on Speaker A's interests, family, and shared activities with Speaker B, none of which pertain to the current dialogue context about plane tickets.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
