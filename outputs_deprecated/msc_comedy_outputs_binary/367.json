    "raw_prediction": "Speaker B: I'm glad you enjoy playing all kinds of games, even though scary ones aren't your thing. I can understand why you might not enjoy Resident Evil. It can be pretty intense and scary. Have you ever tried playing any hunting games? I know you enjoy hunting deer in real life, so maybe a hunting game would be a fun way to pass the time without the scare factor.",

It also provides context about Speaker B's recent purchase of Resident Evil VIII and their experience with it, which could inform Unknown's response by acknowledging past interactions and shared gaming plans.\n\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
