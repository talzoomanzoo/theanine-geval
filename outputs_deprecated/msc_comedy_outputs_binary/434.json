It's amazing to see how everyone comes together to overcome challenges and make the most out of limited resources. Plus, nothing beats the feeling of accomplishment when you successfully start a fire or cook a meal with just the basics. It's all about pushing yourself to learn and grow, which is something I really value in both scouts and in my job at the fast food place.",
