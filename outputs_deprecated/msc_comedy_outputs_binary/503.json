    "raw_prediction": "Response: If I were to win the lotto, I'd definitely use the money to buy a bigger farm where I can have both a city and country house. It would be the perfect balance for me - some peace and quiet in the country, but still close enough to the city for convenience. I can imagine having a nice little spot where we can listen to blues music and enjoy the fresh air. What do you think?",
