    "raw_prediction": "Speaker B: Learning to surf is actually quite similar to learning to play an instrument - it takes time, practice, and patience. Just like how you taught yourself drums, I've been taking lessons and practicing on my own to improve my surfing skills. It's a process, but I find it really rewarding to be out on the waves, just like how you feel when you're fishing near the ocean. Have you ever tried surfing before?",
