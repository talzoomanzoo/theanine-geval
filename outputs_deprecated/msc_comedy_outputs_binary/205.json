    "raw_prediction": "Response: That sounds like a plan! I'll definitely make sure to schedule our casual game on the weekend when I'm off work. I'll text Cynthia's number to you later so you can connect with her about career prospects. Oh, and I'll make sure there are no spiders around when we meet up to play!",

The context of seeking career advice, career preferences, arachnophobia, and previous conversations about soccer teams does not provide insight or context about Speaker A's position in soccer.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
