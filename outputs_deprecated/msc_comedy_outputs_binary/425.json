    "raw_prediction": "Speaker A: I appreciate how having snakes like Hensel and Gretel aligns with my interest in neuroscience. Their behavior and unique biology offer a fascinating perspective on the nervous system. Plus, their low maintenance allows me to focus on my research and volunteer work without worrying about their care. It's a perfect balance for me.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY provides information about Speaker A's interests, such as neuroscience and scuba diving, but it does not mention anything about Speaker A having pet snakes. Thus, it does not offer helpful information for generating a response to Speaker B's question about pet snakes in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\nJudgement: \"No\""
