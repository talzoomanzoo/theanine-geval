    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY indicates that Speaker B works in a research lab, specifically cooking hamburgers and feeding lab rats. This information is potentially helpful since the DIALOGUE CONTEXT mentions a lab-related topic (cloning a cow), which suggests Speaker B's involvement or interest in lab activities could contribute to the context of the conversation. Thus, the MEMORY contains relevant information that could guide Unknown's response.\n\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
