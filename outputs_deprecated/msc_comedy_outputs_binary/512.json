    "raw_prediction": "Speaker B: I'm currently living in France, actually. It's been a great experience living here, but I do miss our ice skating outings! And I'm sure your son's girlfriend will be thrilled to meet you. It's always nice to see our children happy and in love. When you visit, let's definitely catch up and maybe try out some new French cuisine together!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY provides information about the relationship between Speaker A and B, noting their shared enjoyment of ice skating. Additionally, it describes Speaker A's sons, who enjoy various activities, though it doesn't specifically mention if they like ice skating. However, since the MEMORY indicates that Speaker A and Speaker B have gone ice skating together, it's plausible that this activity might extend to Speaker A's family. Therefore, the MEMORY partially aligns with the inquiry in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the sons' interest in ice skating.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
