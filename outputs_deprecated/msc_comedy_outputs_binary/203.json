I really appreciate it.\nSpeaker A: No problem at all, happy to help. And hey, if you ever need a break from work, we can always hit the field for some soccer.\nSpeaker B: Definitely, I could use the exercise. Let's plan something soon, maybe we can even catch an Arsenal game together afterwards.",

The MEMORY focuses on Speaker B's personal and professional background, interests, and past interactions with Speaker A, but none of this helps in determining what position Speaker A played in college soccer.\nJudgement: \"No\""
