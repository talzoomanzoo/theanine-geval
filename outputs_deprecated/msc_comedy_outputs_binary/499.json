    "raw_prediction": "Response: That's great to hear! It sounds like your new iPhone is perfect for your love of music. Maybe we can even find some blues concerts to attend together in the future.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY provides background on Speaker A's lifestyle, values, and relationship with Speaker B, which can be used to understand the context of their comment about the iPhone being expensive. However, it does not specifically contribute to generating a response about buying an expensive phone. Therefore, the MEMORY is not directly helpful for this conversation.\nJudgement: \"No\""
