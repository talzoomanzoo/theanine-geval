    "raw_prediction": "Speaker A: It sounds like you have a lot of exciting plans for your living room and patio! I think a screened-in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle would create a cozy atmosphere for your outdoor space. And it's great that you're considering furniture that is safe for your dogs. When you're ready, I can help you pick out some vibrant colors to add to your new color scheme. Can't wait to see how everything turns out!",

Although the MEMORY focuses more on furniture choices and grilling preferences rather than music, it establishes their relationship and plans to meet for activities that could include playing guitar as mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
