    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY primarily contains information related to the Mentee's journey to sobriety and the Mentor's supportive role in that process. However, the DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on a specific instance where the Mentor helped the Mentee find their glasses, which is unrelated to the sobriety topic. Hence, MEMORY does not contain relevant information to generate the next response.\nJudgement: \"No\""
