    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about the Mentee's past experiences with feeling overwhelmed, decision-making, and studying, but it does not directly relate to the current issue of loneliness in a new city. There is no mention of social connections, adaptation to a new environment, or past experiences of overcoming loneliness. Therefore, this MEMORY is not helpful for addressing the current situation.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
