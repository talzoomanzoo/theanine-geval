    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about a lunch invitation, which is primarily a social interaction. The MEMORY information is mainly about Co-worker B's supportive and encouraging behavior towards Co-worker A, as well as facts about their past professional collaboration and Co-worker A's competition plans. This information does not have a direct connection to responding to a lunch invitation, which is focused on social engagement rather than professional encouragement or support.\nJudgement: \"No\""
