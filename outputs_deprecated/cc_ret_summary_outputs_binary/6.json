    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT discusses the parent's appreciation for being a good listener. The MEMORY, however, focuses more on past experiences the parent and child shared, which relate to moments of hope and inspiration rather than specifically on listening skills or related conversations. Thus, the MEMORY does not directly contain relevant information about being a good listener.\nJudgement: \"No\""
