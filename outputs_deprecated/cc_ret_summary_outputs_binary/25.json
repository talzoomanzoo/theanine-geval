The MEMORY contains various information about the working relationship and mutual respect between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, but does not provide any specific past information that directly relates to someone being the boss or the implications of such a statement. Therefore, MEMORY does not contain information that would help generate a specific response to Co-worker A's statement about being the boss.\nJudgement: \"No\""
