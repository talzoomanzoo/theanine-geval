    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT indicates that Neighbor A is upset and surprised by a breakup or separation. Although MEMORY contains information about Neighbor A appreciating support from Neighbor B during grief and their close friendship, it specifically mentions grieving the loss of a grandmother, which is a different context than the breakup situation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Nothing in MEMORY directly connects to this breakup event or to how Neighbor A feels about romantic relationships.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
