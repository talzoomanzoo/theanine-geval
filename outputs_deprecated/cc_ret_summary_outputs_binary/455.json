    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about Neighbor A feeling shocked and upset because their partner left them. Among the entries in the MEMORY, none directly reference Neighbor A's relationship or partner. While some memories indicate that Neighbor A has moved to a safer place or values emotional support from others, these are not directly relevant to the current situation of being left by a partner. Therefore, the MEMORY entries do not contain specific helpful past information that directly addresses Neighbor A's current situation regarding the breakup.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
