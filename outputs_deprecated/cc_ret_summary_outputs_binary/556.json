    "raw_prediction": "I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed with work lately, but trying out new recipes and cooking has been a great stress-reliever for me.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The memory primarily revolves around the topic of new experiences in cooking, sharing recipes, and trying new things, which doesn't directly connect to the current dialogue context, where Neighbors A is asking if Neighbors B can keep a secret. This context is not related to cooking or recipes, so the memory does not provide helpful past information for generating a response to the question of keeping a secret.\nJudgement: \"No\""
