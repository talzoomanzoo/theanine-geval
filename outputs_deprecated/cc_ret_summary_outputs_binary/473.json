    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, working at the grocery store has been helping me save up money for training and pursuing my dream of becoming a professional basketball player. It's a tough journey, but I'm not giving up. Your support means a lot to me.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains details about Classmate A's aspirations, mindset, and support system, which are unrelated to the issue of getting caught cheating on taxes. The focus is on Classmate A's dream of being a professional basketball player and Classmate B's support, which doesn't connect with the context of dealing with tax cheating consequences. Therefore, the MEMORY does not include relevant past information.\nJudgement: \"No\""
