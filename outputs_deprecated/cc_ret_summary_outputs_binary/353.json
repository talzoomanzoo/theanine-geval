    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about Co-worker A and B's work relationship and past experiences, but it does not include any information about the boss or the supportive relationship that Co-worker A is expressing in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, the MEMORY does not contain helpful information that directly relates to the context of being grateful for a supportive boss.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
