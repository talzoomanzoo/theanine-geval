    "raw_prediction": "Maybe we could both take a look at the property survey together to confirm the boundaries. That way, we can avoid any potential issues in the future.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around marking a boundary line to distinguish properties. MEMORY contains information about past interactions, shared interests, and offers of support between the neighbors. However, none of the details in MEMORY pertain directly to the boundary issue or property division. There is no relevant information that would aid in generating a response about property boundaries.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
