    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about Co-worker B's perception of Co-worker A as positive, resilient and their supportive friendship, which could be helpful in interpreting Co-worker A's statement in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as a light-hearted joke or something non-serious rather than an actual plan. This understanding of their relationship dynamic is useful for Unknown to generate a proper response.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
