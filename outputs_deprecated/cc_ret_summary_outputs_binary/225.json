The MEMORY details interactions related to personal support, career development, and mutual care, but it does not contain any direct information relevant to property lines or boundary disputes. There is no prior discussion related to property divisions which would provide context or clarity on the current dialogue about property boundaries.\nJudgement: \"No\""
