    "raw_prediction": "Well, it's just that I completely froze during that emergency drill earlier. I couldn't think straight and panicked. It made me realize how important it is to stay calm and think clearly in difficult situations, like you did when we were stranded in space. You handled it so well, and it's something I really admire about you.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The memory entries provided do not contain information relevant to Classmate B's current condition, which involves having a red and splotchy face potentially due to sunburn. The memories focus on mutual support, admiration, resilience during past experiences, and personal philosophies, none of which directly address or explain the condition mentioned in the dialogue context.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
