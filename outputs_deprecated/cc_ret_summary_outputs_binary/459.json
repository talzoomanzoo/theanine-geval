    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about Neighbor A expressing disbelief and sadness over a recent breakup. While the MEMORY contains information about Neighbor A's grief and emotional needs, it primarily focuses on the support from Neighbor B and other events in Neighbor A's life, like the loss of their grandmother and moving to a new neighborhood. As the context specifically involves a breakup, the MEMORY doesn't provide directly relevant information about the breakup situation or information that could help address Neighbor A's feelings regarding the breakup itself.\nJudgement: No"
