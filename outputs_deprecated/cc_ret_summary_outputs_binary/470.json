    "raw_prediction": "I understand that you're feeling discouraged, but remember what we talked about before. Stay focused on your goal of becoming a professional basketball player. Believe in yourself and keep pushing forward. Don't let doubts or setbacks hold you back. You have the determination and dedication to achieve your goals, both in basketball and in your job. Just keep working hard and things will fall into place.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY mostly contains information about Classmate A's aspirations of becoming a professional basketball player, their mindset, and their efforts towards that goal. The current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, however, pertains to Classmate A's tax-related issue, which is unrelated to basketball aspirations or motivational advice. Therefore, the MEMORY does not contain helpful information relevant to resolving or dealing with the tax cheating situation. \n\nJudgement: \"No\""
