Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately. Classmates B: Why is that? Classmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness.\n2. Classmate A and Classmate B are classmates.\n3. Classmates B offers support and suggests taking a step back to find a balance.\n4. Classmates B emphasizes the importance of enjoying the journey and effort put in, not just focusing on winning.\n5. Classmates A expresses gratitude for the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n6. Classmate A emphasizes the importance of self-care and relaxation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! Your dedication to improving yourself is truly admirable. Just remember to find a balance and not burn yourself out. Enjoy the process and the learning journey.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for the dialogue context in several ways. First, sentence 1 acknowledges Classmates A's determination, which aligns with the current conversation about focusing on studying algebra. Sentence 3, where Classmates B offers support and suggests finding balance, complements the context by providing a possible supportive response Classmates B might say in response to Classmates Aâ€™s goals. Sentence 5, where Classmates A expresses gratitude, might follow a conversation where Classmates B has been supportive, as in the current dialogue. Sentence 4 about enjoying the journey and effort aligns with encouraging logical and critical thinking as part of learning algebra. Overall, these sentences show a clear development of interactions between the classmates contributing to generating a coherent and connected response. Sentence 2 serves as basic background information and isn't directly relevant to advancing the conversation. Sentence 6 about self-care seems least directly applicable but could be offered as advice after recognition of Classmates A's hard work. Most sentences are related to the context or structured in a way to support a cohesive narrative, hence the score of 4."
