Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message. Co-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident. Co-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows. Co-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive. Co-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right. Co-workers B: Speaking of convincing people, have you ever been in a physical altercation before?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument.\n2. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs.\n3. Co-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\n4. Co-worker A has experience dealing with challenging clients and emphasizes the importance of communication and setting expectations.\n5. Co-worker A believes their evidence is more compelling than the opposing side's evidence.\n6. Co-worker A agrees to be more conscious of how they come across to others in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you for the compliment. I haven't been in a physical altercation before, but I believe in resolving conflicts through communication and understanding. It's crucial to handle challenging situations with care and empathy.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, points 1, 3, and 5 about Co-worker A collecting evidence, the strength of their argument, and their belief in the superiority of their evidence are directly relevant and beneficial for the continuation of the current conversation about speaking skills and presenting compelling arguments. This adds depth and context to Co-worker A's skills in debates and public speaking, as mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Points 2 and 6, while slightly less directly related, still contribute to understanding the dynamics between Co-worker A and B, such as B's admiration for A and A's self-awareness. Point 4 is the least relevant to the current dialogue context, but it is still well-structured and provides useful background about Co-worker Aâ€™s skills and experiences. Overall, the memory holds relevance and continuity with the context while being clearly structured, but it could be more tightly aligned with the key points of the dialogue to deserve a perfect score."
