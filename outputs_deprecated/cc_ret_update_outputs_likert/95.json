    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you. Classmates B: Oh really? What are they? Classmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners. Classmates B: Wow, that sounds amazing! What kind of project are you thinking about? Classmates A: I was thinking about starting a marketing agency specialized in social media. Classmates B: That's a great idea! I'd love to work with you on that. We could really make a difference in the industry. Classmates A: Yes, exactly! And I think our skills complement each other's so well. Classmates B: I totally agree. You're so creative and outgoing, while I'm more analytical and detail-oriented.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n2. Classmate B admires Classmate A's outgoing nature and wants to be more like them.\n3. Classmate A and Classmate B enjoy singing karaoke together and look forward to future outings.\n4. Classmates A is social and enjoys meeting new people.\n5.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provided offers limited helpfulness with respect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the memory contains some information about the personalities and past interactions of Classmates A and B (such as Classmate B admiring Classmate A's outgoing nature, and both enjoying social activities), it fails to provide specific information that could be directly linked to the current dialogue about starting a business together. The past interactions and traits described in the MEMORY could give a general sense of the relationship dynamics but they don't directly contribute to the development of the business plan discussion specifically. The memory lacks detail on previous joint work experiences or skills relevant to establishing a marketing agency, for instance. Some sentences, like enjoying karaoke or plans for future coffee meetings, are naturally phrased but irrelevant for the context of business planning, which is the key focus of the dialogue. Therefore, while it includes some useful context about their relationship, overall, it offers minimal helpful aid in generating a response centered around the current business project dialogue."
