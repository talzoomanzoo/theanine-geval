    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today. Classmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about? Classmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B noticed Classmates A's improvement and acknowledged their hard work.\n2. Classmate B is working on finishing a history project.\n3. Classmates B recalls a funny moment from high school involving Classmates A wearing pajamas to school.\n4. Classmate B is interested in attending a new technology conference next month.\n5. Classmate A shares interesting information about the spinning jenny and its impact on the textile industry.\n6. Classmates A's grades are looking good according to their teacher.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Wow, that sounds fascinating! The engineering and cultural aspects of the pyramids must have been so interesting to learn about. Do you think you'll ever visit Egypt to see them in person?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY consists of several pieces of information, but most of them are not directly relevant or helpful for generating a follow-up response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the talk on the history of the pyramids in Egypt. Sentences like Classmate B's interest in a technology conference or a funny high school memory do not contribute to the conversation about the talk and its content. While some sentences illustrate a bit of background information about the classmates' relationships or interests, they lack a clear connection to the current dialogue, diminishing their helpfulness. The MEMORY does not adequately support or enrich the current conversation about the talk on the pyramids, hence the score of 2."
