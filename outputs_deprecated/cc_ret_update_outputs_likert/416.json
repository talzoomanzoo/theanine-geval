Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm really excited about finding a buyer for my product. I think it has a lot of potential. Neighbors B: That's great to hear, what kind of product is it? Neighbors A: It's a new type of workout equipment that's designed to be more efficient than traditional equipment. I've been working on it for months now and I really think it's going to take off. Neighbors B: Wow, that sounds interesting. Have you started looking for potential buyers? Neighbors A: Yes, I've been reaching out to various gyms and fitness centers to see if they'd be interested in carrying the product. I've even gotten some positive feedback from a few places. Neighbors B: That's awesome! I'm sure with your determination, you'll find the perfect buyer soon. Neighbors A: Thanks, I really appreciate your support. It's been a long road, but I'm confident that all my hard work will pay off.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's efforts to change and become a better version of themselves.\n2. Neighbors B expresses a desire for Neighbors A to succeed and emphasizes the importance of treating others with respect and putting in effort at work.\n3. Neighbors B appreciated Neighbors A's support during this difficult situation.\n4. Neighbors A is trying to improve their behavior at work and be a better colleague.\n5. Neighbors A and Neighbors B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as they enjoy having coffee and chatting together.\n6. Neighbors A noticed that Neighbors B's dog has been missing for a few days.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I have no doubt that your dedication and effort will lead to success. Remember to stay positive and keep pushing forward. Your hard work will definitely pay off in the end.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some useful information, such as Neighbors B being supportive of Neighbors A's efforts, which aligns with the supportive tone in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, most of the sentences in the MEMORY do not provide specific helpful information related to the context of finding a buyer for a product or the product itself. There is a significant disconnect between the MEMORY and the current focus of the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about Neighbors A's new workout equipment and their efforts to find buyers. The MEMORY focuses more on general support, past interactions, and unrelated topics like the missing dog, which might be of less relevance to the dialogue context. Therefore, while the MEMORY contains naturally structured sentences reflecting a general relationship between Neighbors A and B, it lacks in providing development and causality specific to the dialogue context."
