Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, check out this spot I found to camp out for the night. It's perfect! Classmates B: Wow, this view is amazing! Classmates A: I know, right? And it's completely level and free of any debris. We won't have to worry about rolling off our sleeping pads or anything like that.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B finds Classmates A's involvement in the community admirable and important.\n2. Classmate A and Classmate B are classmates who attended a party together.\n3. Classmate A expresses a desire to find alternative ways to have fun and make a positive impact in the community.\n4. Classmate A is concerned about the party being discovered and getting in trouble with the school.\n5. Classmates B remembers Classmates A's previous involvement in community improvement projects and acknowledges their passion for making a difference.\n6. Classmate B is involved in an action committee working on organizing a community clean-up day.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's great that you found such a comfortable spot! Speaking of clean spaces, have you heard about the community clean-up day our action committee is organizing? It might be another way for us to have fun while making a positive impact in the community.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information that could be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, the context of camping out and enjoying the view could be connected to the shared experiences and interests mentioned in the MEMORY, such as involvement in community projects and finding alternative ways to have fun. This can shape an understanding of their characters and past interactions, providing context for their appreciation of the camping spot. However, the MEMORY contains some details that are not directly related to the current conversation about camping, such as concerns about a party being discovered (sentence 4). Overall, while the MEMORY provides some context about the characters' interests and past interactions, it lacks strong cohesion in terms of directly contributing to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences are not consistently cohesive or clearly connected to the camping scenario, but they do give some cues about the relationship and interests of the classmates."
