Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A is grateful for life experiences and is open to new possibilities in the future.\n2. Co-worker A has grown as a person and as an artist, learning about empathy and compassion.\n3. Co-worker B emphasized the importance of learning from mistakes and working together as a team.\n4. Co-worker A is creative and talented in making jewelry.\n5. Co-worker A had a tough week on set, feeling overwhelmed and chaotic.\n6. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's wonderful to hear. Having a supportive boss can make such a difference in your work environment. It's great to have that sense of appreciation and encouragement.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some contextual information about Co-worker A's personality and past interactions which can facilitate creating a suitable response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 2, 4, and 5 provide a glimpse into Co-worker A's personal development, creativity, and their recent experiences, which might help inform a supportive response. Sentence 3 captures an aspect of Co-worker B that can relate to the supportive perception of Co-worker A's boss. Sentence 6 indicates a positive work relationship and outcome from their collaboration, which is relevant in highlighting the supportive environment. However, these sentences are loosely connected and do not directly address the current sentiment in DIALOGUE CONTEXT, lacking direct causality or connection necessary for a higher score."
