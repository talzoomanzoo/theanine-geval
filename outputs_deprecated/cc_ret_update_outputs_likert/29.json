Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water? Neighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for. Neighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit. Neighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water. Neighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it. Neighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again. Neighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower? Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work. Neighbors A: It was. But it was also a good workout. Neighbors B: I prefer to work out indoors where there's air conditioning.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\n2. Neighbors B agrees that mowing the lawn is a lot of work but acknowledges the exercise it provides.\n3. Neighbors A mentioned mowing the lawn with an old push mower, indicating they are responsible for the yard work.\n4. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n5. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n6. Neighbors A and B plan to work on mowing the lawn together next time to make it easier and possibly discover more things in common.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I get that, but being outside in the fresh air has its own charm, don't you think? Maybe next time we tackle the lawn together, we can make it more enjoyable and get the job done faster.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided is mostly relevant and helpful for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains sentences that reflect the shared history between the two neighbors, particularly their experiences related to outdoor chores like mowing the lawn. This is relevant to the latter part of the dialogue where they discuss mowing the lawn and the exercise it provides. The memories emphasize the idea of camaraderie and shared experiences, which is valuable context for continuing the conversation. Also, the suggestions about mowing the lawn next time (like having extra water) show care and consideration, which might influence the dynamics in future interactions between the neighbors. However, some sentences, such as those mentioning conversations about temperature, do not directly connect to the current dialogue and may not be as helpful. Nonetheless, the memory is generally well-structured and provides useful contextual information."
