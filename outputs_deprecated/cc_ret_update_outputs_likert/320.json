Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today? Co-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there? Co-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done. Co-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded. Co-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out. Co-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides.\n2. Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits.\n3. Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides.\n4. Co-worker A went through a painful breakup and finds it hard to trust people.\n5. Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions.\n6. Co-worker A is trying to improve their punctuality and cut back on drinking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but does not directly address it. The sentences in MEMORY generally focus on Co-worker A's struggles with punctuality, drinking habits, and efforts to be more responsible, which is indirectly related to the dialogue's brief mention of Co-worker A's past situation with being stranded. Additionally, Co-worker B's awareness and concern about these habits and offering advice are indirectly relevant. However, the connection between the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY is not very strong, and some sentences such as those mentioning Co-worker A's breakup, don't contribute significantly to generating the next response. The MEMORY provides context about the relationship between the co-workers and hints at Co-worker A's personal challenges, which may slightly inform their interactions. Overall, the information in the MEMORY is somewhat helpful in understanding the complexities of their relationship, but not directly useful for the current conversation thread."
