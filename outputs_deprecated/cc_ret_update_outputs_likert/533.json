Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess. Classmates B: Wait, what? You cheated on your taxes? That's not okay. Classmates A: I know, I know. I was just really struggling financially and I thought I could get away with it. Classmates B: You can't just cheat and hope to never get caught. That's not how it works. Classmates A: Remember when we talked about me wanting to become a professional basketball player? Classmates B: Yeah, I remember. So, what does that have to do with cheating on your taxes? Classmates A: It's just that I feel like I keep hitting roadblocks in my life. Every time I try to move forward, something happens to set me back. It's really discouraging.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed.\n2. Classmates A has a big dream of becoming a professional basketball player and works hard towards that goal.\n3. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to keep pushing themselves and not let doubts hold them back.\n4. Classmates A sometimes doubts if they are good enough to make it to the professional level.\n5. Classmate A is pursuing a dream of becoming a professional basketball player and is working at a grocery store to save up money for training.\n6. Classmates A believes in hard work and dedication to achieve goals both in basketball and their job.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I get that things might seem tough right now, but remember what we talked about before. Stay focused on your goal of becoming a professional basketball player. Believe in yourself and keep pushing forward. It's important to stay determined and not let doubts or setbacks hold you back. And hey, if you ever need help or support along the way, don't hesitate to ask for it. You've got this!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains details about Classmates A's aspiration to become a professional basketball player and their struggles with self-doubt, which are relevant to Classmates A's expressed feeling of hitting roadblocks. This information helps the language model understand Classmates A's context better. However, the MEMORY lacks direct references to the specific issue of cheating on taxes or the resulting consequences, which are also central to the current dialogue. Thus, while it helps in understanding Classmates Aâ€™s personal challenges, it does not sufficiently cover the complete thematic context of the dialogue. Additionally, the sentences are naturally structured and provide a coherent picture of the past interactions, which aids in identifying important contextual cues."
