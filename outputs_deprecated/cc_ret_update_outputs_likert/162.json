Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Thank you for finding my glasses for me, Mentor. I always seem to misplace them. Mentor: Not a problem, Mentee. I'm glad I could help. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor acknowledges Mentee's achievements and provides ongoing support and guidance.\n2. Mentor is willing to share their knowledge with Mentee and help them achieve their goals.\n3. Mentor is proud of Mentee for making positive changes and taking control of their life.\n4. Mentee admires Mentor's success and wants to learn from them.\n5. The Mentor advises the Mentee to be gentle with themselves when they slip back into old patterns.\n6. The Mentor encourages the Mentee to prioritize self-care and explore new ways to stay healthy and happy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of information about the Mentee and Mentor's relationship, such as the Mentor's role in supporting, guiding, and advising the Mentee. These points suggest a supportive dynamic, which could be useful for a language model generating a future response in the dialogue. However, the MEMORY does not specifically relate to the immediate issue of the Mentee misplacing their glasses, which is the focus of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memories generally describe the relationship positively and in a way that captures the Mentor's supportive role, but lack direct relevance to the context provided. Despite this, the structure of MEMORY is coherent and fits naturally within the broader Mentor-Mentee relationship, allowing easy interpretation even if the connection to the context isn't strong. Thus, it scores in the middle range."
