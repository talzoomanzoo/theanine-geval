Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today. Classmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about? Classmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held. Classmates B: Wow, that does sound interesting. Did you take any notes? Classmates A: Yes, I took lots of notes. I'm excited to study this topic more on my own time. Classmates B: That's awesome. It's great to see your enthusiasm for learning. Classmates A: Thanks. I've always been passionate about learning new things. Remember when we talked about how determined I was to get into college?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B noticed Classmates A's improvement and acknowledged their hard work.\n2. Classmates A had a moment of frustration in the past but has learned to channel that energy into studies.\n3. Classmates A struggled with motivation but found a way to stay focused by thinking about the payoff of their hard work.\n4. Classmates A's grades are looking good according to their teacher.\n5. Classmate B is working on finishing a history project.\n6. Classmates A is willing to work hard to achieve their dreams.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a general background about Classmates Aâ€™s academic journey and disposition, which can be helpful in reinforcing the enthusiasm and passion for learning demonstrated in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 6 directly connects to Classmates A's determination mentioned in the dialogue. However, some elements, such as the history project mentioned in Sentence 5, don't directly contribute to the current dialogue context with regard to the pyramids talk. The sentences are mostly relevant and naturally structured, but they don't all offer direct development of the current interaction. Thus, the MEMORY provides a fair amount of helpful context, but there is room for improvement in connecting to the specific dialogue context."
