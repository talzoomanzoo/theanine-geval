    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work. Wife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help. Husband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff. Wife: Nonsense! You can always come to me with anything. Plus, I enjoy helping you with your creative process. Have you also tried revisiting some of the writing prompts we did in our creative writing class? Husband: I have, but I feel like I'm just repeating the same stories over and over again. Wife: Maybe it's time to take a step back and try something new. Have you ever tried writing in a different genre or experimenting with different styles?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Wife suggests that husband should try using more modern language to be better understood.\n2. Wife brings up Sarah, the husband's previous partner, but husband says he hasn't thought about her much.\n3. The wife compares the situation to when the husband fell asleep during a movie she recommended, indicating past issues in their relationship.\n4. Husband agrees to try adapting to modern language for better communication with his wife.\n5. The wife reassures the husband that it's okay to be different and encourages him to embrace who he is.\n6. The husband and wife plan to have a movie night together in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't really explored different genres or styles before, but that's a great suggestion. Maybe it's time for me to step out of my comfort zone and see where it takes me. Thanks for the encouragement and for being so supportive, it means a lot.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information, but it offers limited helpfulness regarding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Some sentences, like the wife's reassurance (sentence 5), could indirectly relate to the encouragement she offers in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, most other sentences do not clearly connect or provide relevant information about the current conversation about the husband's writing struggles. Additionally, the interactions and events mentioned in MEMORY, such as references to past issues (sentence 3) or a planned movie night (sentence 6), are loosely related at best and do not significantly advance the dialogue. Overall, MEMORY is not well-structured to guide the language model in generating a response relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
