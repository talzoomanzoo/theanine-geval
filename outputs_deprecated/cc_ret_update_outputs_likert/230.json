    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now! Neighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen? Neighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest. Neighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations! What are you going to do with all that money? Neighbors A: Well, first I'm going to pay off my mortgage and all my debts. After that, I think I'll take a nice long vacation and maybe donate some to charity. Neighbors B: That's very generous of you. Have you thought about investing any of it? Neighbors A: Yes, actually. I've been doing some research and I think I want to invest in some stocks and maybe even start my own business. Neighbors B: That sounds like a great idea. You have the opportunity to do so much with your newfound wealth. Neighbors A: Definitely. It's funny how things can change so quickly. Just a few years ago, I was stuck in a job I hated and now I have all this freedom.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A made a big career change recently and is much happier now.\n2. Neighbors A took the leap to make a change and is glad they did.\n3. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's decision and admires the courage it took.\n4. Neighbors A and B had a conversation a couple of years ago about needing a change.\n5. Neighbors B has been supportive of Neighbors A's job search, offering to connect them with people in different industries.\n6. Neighbors A plans to start looking for new opportunities soon and needs to update their resume and start networking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some relevant context about Neighbors A's past career change, which aligns with the current dialogue about newfound freedom and life changes due to the inheritance. However, the memory lacks specific details about the inheritance event, which is the central topic of the dialogue context. The memory's focus on career change is somewhat helpful but does not directly assist in generating a response to the current discussion about inheritance and financial decisions. Additionally, the memory statements are somewhat disconnected from each other, lacking a clear development or causality relevant to the dialogue context. Therefore, while the memory does offer some background information, it is limited in its direct helpfulness and relevance."
