    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway? Wife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go? Husband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city. Wife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband apologized and promised to involve the wife in his plans in the future.\n2. The husband is inspired by his wife to take action on his dreams and goals.\n3. The husband values the wife's encouragement and positivity in his pursuit of his goals.\n4. The husband is excited about his progress on long-awaited plans and is putting in a lot of effort to make them a reality.\n5. The husband and wife are committed to each other and excited about their future together.\n6. The wife admires the husband's determination and big heart.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a moderate level of helpfulness for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY includes information about the husband's admiration for his wife, indicating a supportive and positive relationship, which is relevant since the dialogue context involves planning a getaway together. However, specific connections between the memory entries and the dialogue context, such as decision-making or planning aspects, are lacking. Additionally, while the MEMORY describes positive aspects of the couple's relationship in general, it could be more directly related to their interactions and dynamics leading to this particular conversation about spending time together. The MEMORY provides a background that supports the overall vibe of their interaction but doesn't offer direct interactions that would be significantly beneficial in crafting the next response."
