Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly. Neighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit? Neighbors A: It was Chicago. I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations. Neighbors B: I bet it was a nice change of scenery from our neighborhood. Neighbors A: Definitely. But you know, it's interesting how much our neighborhood has grown on me over the years. I remember when I first moved here, I was so unsure about it. Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember. But you stayed because you wanted to be here. Neighbors A: That's right. And since then, I've made so many great memories here. It's become my home. Neighbors B: And you're still spending time with God every day, right? Neighbors A: Yes, I am. It brings me so much peace and happiness. Neighbors B: That's really admirable. And speaking of power, I remember you telling me about that time when you could make me do anything you wanted. Neighbors A: Oh, gosh. That was so long ago. I can't even believe I had that kind of power over you. Neighbors B: I'm just glad we've both grown since then, and we can have a friendship that's based on mutual respect. Neighbors A: Absolutely. And now, I'm excited to explore my new neighborhood and get to know the people here. It feels like a fresh start.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A enjoys living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbors A is excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends.\n3. Neighbors B has been living in the neighborhood for some time and is supportive of Neighbors A.\n4. Neighbors A appreciates having friendly faces around and hopes to make new friends soon.\n5. Neighbors A values the relationship with Neighbors B and considers them like family.\n6. Neighbors A just moved to a new neighborhood and is getting to know the area.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

It's always exciting to start fresh and create new memories in a different environment. Just remember, you'll always have a friend in me no matter where you go.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information, but it's not entirely helpful due to a lack of detail and specificity. While it highlights the relationship between Neighbors A and Neighbors B and Neighbors A's feelings towards their neighborhood, it could be more precise in capturing key elements from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it doesn't mention the conversation about Chicago or reflect on past experiences or shared growth and power dynamics indicative of their history. These details would have provided the language model with stronger contextual cues for generating a response. Nonetheless, the MEMORY does have some groundwork for understanding their relationship dynamics and current situation."
