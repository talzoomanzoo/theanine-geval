    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly. Neighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit? Neighbors A: It was Chicago. I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations. Neighbors B: I bet it was a nice change of scenery from our neighborhood.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A enjoys living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbors A is excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends.\n3. Neighbors A just moved to a new neighborhood and is getting to know the area.\n4. Neighbors A appreciates having friendly faces around and hopes to make new friends soon.\n5. Neighbors B acknowledges Neighbors A's friendly and outgoing nature.\n6. Neighbors B has been living in the neighborhood for some time and is supportive of Neighbors A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It was definitely a different vibe, but there's something special about our neighborhood that I really appreciate. The sense of community here is wonderful, and I'm grateful to have made such great friends like you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers some helpful information about Neighbors A and B's relationship and interactions. Sentences such as Neighbors A feeling comfortable and safe, making good friends including Neighbors B, and Neighbors B being supportive can help a language model understand the friendly relationship and supportive dynamic between the neighbors. This context is slightly beneficial as it shows Neighbors A's tendency to explore and make friends, which is consistent with the dialogue about them visiting Chicago. However, the MEMORY lacks direct relevance to the specific conversation about Chicago. The information on the neighborhood and the friendship dynamic, while useful for developing general context, does not directly inform the specifics of the dialogue about the trip to Chicago. Some sentences also seem somewhat repetitive, like Neighbors A's desire to make new friends being mentioned more than once. Overall, while the MEMORY provides foundational context about the neighbors' relationship, its direct usefulness in enhancing the dialogue context about Chicago is limited."
