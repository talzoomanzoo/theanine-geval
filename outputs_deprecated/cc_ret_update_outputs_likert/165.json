    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Thank you for finding my glasses for me, Mentor. I always seem to misplace them. Mentor: Not a problem, Mentee. I'm glad I could help.  Mentee: This actually reminds me of when I was struggling with substance abuse. I would often lose things or forget where I put things because of my drinking. It's amazing how much clearer my mind is now that I'm sober. Mentor: That's a great observation, Mentee. Sobriety can definitely improve your cognitive abilities and overall wellbeing. It's amazing how much substance abuse can hold us back in life. Mentee: Yeah, it's definitely a difficult journey, but I'm grateful for the support systems I have in place. Like you, Mentor. Your experience and guidance have been invaluable to me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor is proud of Mentee for making positive changes and taking control of their life.\n2. Mentee has a history of substance abuse but has been sober for a year.\n3. Mentor acknowledges Mentee's achievements and provides ongoing support and guidance.\n4. Mentee values living in the moment and staying focused on their sobriety and goals.\n5. The Mentee is dedicated to their sobriety and believes incorporating yoga into their routine will benefit their mental and physical health.\n6. Mentor is willing to share their knowledge with Mentee and help them achieve their goals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. The first sentence is relevant as it reflects Mentor's pride, which aligns with the positive encouragement expressed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n2. The second sentence provides context about Mentee's history and sobriety, which is directly related to the conversation about substance abuse.\n3. The third sentence is relevant as it aligns with Mentor's supportive role mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n4. The fourth sentence adds depth by highlighting Mentee's focus on sobriety and goals, which connects to the discussion about clear-mindedness.\n5. The fifth sentence, while not directly connected, provides additional personal insight into Mentee's approach to maintaining sobriety.\n6. The last sentence reiterates Mentor's supportive role, which is consistent with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThese sentences are structured in a way that captures the development of the relationship between Mentor and Mentee, reflecting recognition, support, and shared goals. However, some sentences, like the fifth, are less directly related to the context and more descriptive of Mentee's current lifestyle, which slightly reduces the overall cohesiveness. Hence, the MEMORY is mostly helpful but not perfectly aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, earning a score of 4."
