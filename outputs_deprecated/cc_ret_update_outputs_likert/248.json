Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend! Co-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang. Co-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while. Co-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing? Co-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites. Co-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together.\n2. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n3. Co-worker A and Co-worker B used to work together at a clothing store.\n4. Co-worker B is married and had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends.\n5. Co-worker A has a talent for solving puzzles and mysteries.\n6. Co-worker A is observant and did some research on social media to find out that Co-worker B is married.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you! I really appreciate that. It was a special moment for me. Do you enjoy singing too, or is there another hobby you're passionate about?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some details about past interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, such as their shared work history and personal details like Co-worker B being married. However, these details do not offer significant relevance or support in generating a next response based on the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around Co-worker A's singing experience. The MEMORY lacks direct references to singing, music, or similar experiences that could provide helpful context for this dialogue. Additionally, the sentences in MEMORY do not strongly demonstrate development, causality, or connection relevant to the given context; thus, the usefulness of the memory in this specific dialogue is limited."
