    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today? Co-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there? Co-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done. Co-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides.\n2. Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits.\n3. Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions.\n4. Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides.\n5. Co-worker A went through a painful breakup and finds it hard to trust people.\n6. Co-worker A is trying to improve their punctuality and cut back on drinking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, it can get pretty busy there. At least you got it taken care of. I'm trying to be more responsible with my time and tasks, like getting to the post office earlier to avoid the rush.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains information about Co-worker A's personal struggles with punctuality, drinking habits, and a past breakup, which may provide some background on Co-worker A's character. However, it lacks direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is centered around a mundane task of going to the post office and dealing with the hassle of sending a package. \n\nWhile insights into Co-worker A's character might help in understanding potential reasons for stress or behavior in other dialogues, it doesn't particularly aid in generating a response to the specific conversation about the post office. Additionally, the memory doesn't provide any direct link or causality to the ongoing dialogue, making it less helpful for creating an appropriate next response. It lacks immediate contextual cues or a clear connection to the conversation at hand, which is necessary for making the MEMORY highly helpful."
