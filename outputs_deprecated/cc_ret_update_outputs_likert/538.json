Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, check out this spot I found to camp out for the night. It's perfect! Classmates B: Wow, this view is amazing!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate A and Classmate B are classmates who attended a party together.\n2. Classmates B finds Classmates A's involvement in the community admirable and important.\n3. Classmates B remembers Classmates A's previous involvement in community improvement projects and acknowledges their passion for making a difference.\n4. Classmate A expresses a desire to find alternative ways to have fun and make a positive impact in the community.\n5. Classmate A is concerned about the party being discovered and getting in trouble with the school.\n6. Classmates A is proactive and curious, taking the initiative to research topics of interest.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I know, right? It's so peaceful up here. I was thinking we could organize a camping trip with some classmates and maybe do some community service while we're out here.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several pieces of helpful information that could be beneficial for the language model in generating a response. Sentences 1 and 5 suggest a context outside the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, indicating a past event that could explain why Classmate A is eager to find a secluded spot, possibly due to past experiences at parties. Sentence 2 and 3 highlight Classmate B's admiration for Classmate A's community involvement, which could shape responses by giving Classmate B a respectful tone towards A. Sentence 4 expresses Classmate A's intent to have fun in a manner that also creates a positive impact, which could influence the conversation's direction towards a discussion of activities aligning with these values. Sentence 6 describes Classmate A's character as proactive, which can assist in predicting how A may lead the conversation. Overall, the information provided is relevant and helpful, albeit not directly linked to a camping context, but it is naturally phrased allowing the model to easily sort out less related memories."
