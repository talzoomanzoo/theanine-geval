Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway? Wife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband is inspired by his wife to take action on his dreams and goals.\n2. The husband values the wife's encouragement and positivity in his pursuit of his goals.\n3. The husband apologized and promised to involve the wife in his plans in the future.\n4. The husband is excited about his progress on long-awaited plans and is putting in a lot of effort to make them a reality.\n5. The husband and wife are committed to each other and excited about their future together.\n6. The wife is supportive and proud of her husband for working towards his goals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information regarding the relationship dynamics between the husband and wife, such as their commitment to each other and the wife's support for her husband's goals (points 5 and 6). These details could be relevant for generating responses in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT that emphasize mutual support and cooperation. However, the MEMORY primarily focuses on the husband's pursuit of goals and the wife's support in that context, which is not directly relevant to planning a getaway trip or spending more time together as discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memories about goals (points 1, 2, and 4) are not immediately useful for the current topic of conversation. Additionally, the MEMORY lacks direct references to past interactions related to planning trips or vacations, which would be more helpful in this situation. Overall, the MEMORY has a mix of relevant and slightly off-topic information with naturally structured sentences, warranting a mid-range score."
