    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water? Neighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for. Neighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit. Neighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water. Neighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it. Neighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again. Neighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower? Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work. Neighbors A: It was. But it was also a good workout. Neighbors B: I prefer to work out indoors where there's air conditioning. Neighbors A: Ha, I remember when I took off my jacket and put my feet up in your armchair. It was so warm that day. Neighbors B: Yeah, that was a hot day. I'm glad you felt comfortable in my home though. Neighbors A: You know, I really enjoy spending time with you. I want to get to know you even better. Neighbors B: I feel the same way. We should plan something fun to do together. Neighbors A: Absolutely. Hey, do you remember when I ripped off the tag from my shirt? Neighbors B: Yeah, your mom was pretty upset about that. Neighbors A: I didn't think it was a big deal, but she sure did. Do you ever have disagreements like that with your parents? Neighbors B: Sometimes, but not often. We have a pretty good relationship. Neighbors A: That's great to hear. I hope I have a good relationship with my kids someday.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\n2. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n3. Neighbors A and B plan to work on mowing the lawn together next time to make it easier and possibly discover more things in common.\n4. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n5. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n6. Neighbor A enjoys spending time in Neighbor B's cozy home and wants to hang out more often.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY generally provides helpful information for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains sentences reflecting the development and nature of the interactions between Neighbors A and B. For instance, memory items 1 and 2 highlight their shared enjoyment of outdoor activities and their familiarity with each other, which is pertinent to their past interactions in the dialogue. Memory item 4 shows Neighbor B's supportive nature towards Neighbor A, which aligns well with the supportive and understanding tone in the context. Memory items 5 and 6 are relevant in highlighting the camaraderie and comfort level between the neighbors. However, memory item 3 assumes that they plan to mow the lawn together in the future, which is not explicitly stated in the dialogue. This slightly reduces the helpfulness as it introduces an element not present in the current context. Overall, the MEMORY is naturally phrased and provides relevant context cues that help in understanding their relationship and interactions, justifying a score of 4."
