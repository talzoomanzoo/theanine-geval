    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn. Teacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation? Student: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle. Teacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time? Student: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then. Teacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going? Student: It's going pretty well. I started with French, but now I'm considering taking up Spanish and German too. I want to become more well-rounded.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The student is studying French at college and plans on learning Spanish and German as well.\n2. The teacher speaks Spanish and French fluently.\n3. The teacher and student have a positive and understanding relationship.\n4. The student mentioned feeling stressed lately, which may have led to the outburst.\n5. The teacher expressed understanding and encouraged the student to seek help when needed.\n6. The student believes in the importance of continuous learning and growth.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fantastic to hear! Learning multiple languages will definitely expand your horizons. Plus, with your dedication and interest in continuous learning, I'm sure you'll excel in Spanish and German as well. If you ever need any help or resources along the way, don't hesitate to reach out.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides mostly relevant and helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory points about the student studying French and planning to learn Spanish and German (1) directly relate to the discussion about language studying in the dialogue context, making it useful for crafting a response. The mention of the teacher speaking Spanish and French fluently (2) is also relevant and could be utilized in future interactions regarding language learning. The mention of the positive relationship (3) is contextually useful, providing a background understanding for the dialogue's tone. Memory point (6) about the student valuing continuous learning aligns with the context of discussing language studies and indicates a relevant mindset for potential future dialogue. However, points 4 and 5, which refer to an unrelated topic about stress and seeking help, do not contribute to the current dialogue context regarding hot sauce or language learning. Overall, most of the memory aids in building a coherent and contextually relevant conversation, but not all points are directly helpful for this specific dialogue context."
