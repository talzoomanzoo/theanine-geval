Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life. Child: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you. Parent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you. Child: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you? Parent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference. Child: I'm glad you found someone to talk to. You know, I remember when we watched the sunrise together a few weeks ago. That was really special. Parent: It was. I love being able to appreciate the beauty of nature. And you know, having my own place to live in the suburbs makes it even easier to do things like that. Child: Yeah, your house is really nice. You've always been good at taking care of yourself. Parent: Well, I've always valued my independence. Even as a kid, I wanted to do things on my own. That's why I decided to live on my own a few years ago. Child: I can see why you would want to do that. You're just really good at being self-sufficient.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The parent values independence and self-sufficiency.\n3. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n4. The parent now lives in a little house in the suburbs that they love.\n5. Both the parent and child enjoy spending time together in their new home.\n6. The parent wants to provide a safe and stable environment for the child.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful context but lacks detail in connection and development pertinent to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY captures important themes like the parent valuing independence and self-sufficiency (2) and living in a house they love in the suburbs (4), which aligns with the dialogue. However, the broader context is somewhat missing. For instance, the mention of the parent finding hope and appreciating small moments (1) partly reflects the dialogue, but lacks clarity on how this directly relates to the detention experience discussed. Also, the MEMORY doesn't explicitly reference the conversation about listening and feeling heard, which is a central component of the dialogue. Sentences like the child finding the parent's story inspiring (3) and both enjoying time in the new home (5) are vague and do not directly support a coherent response generation based on the current dialogue. Moreover, (6) about providing a stable environment gives little new information pertinent to the present conversation. The sentences are generally structured well, but a more targeted focus on the current dialogue aspects would enhance relevance and connectivity."
