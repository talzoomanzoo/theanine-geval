Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B appreciates Neighbors A's handy skills.\n2. Neighbor A noticed some wood near their backyard and asked Neighbor B if they had seen it too.\n3. Neighbors A values double-checking before leaving the house.\n4. Neighbors A is good at fixing things, particularly electronics.\n5. Neighbors A and B are observing wood that appears to be freshly cut from a tree.\n6. Neighbors A apologized to Neighbors B for their behavior and admitted to being wrong.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context for the conversation between Neighbor A and Neighbor B, but only a few pieces of information are directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n- Sentence 1 (Neighbors B appreciates Neighbors A's handy skills) somewhat ties into the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as it could relate to Neighbor A's strength, possibly from physical activity related to being handy.\n  \n- Sentence 4 (Neighbors A is good at fixing things, particularly electronics) might indirectly link to the idea of Neighbor A's abilities or strength, providing some context that could be helpful in continuing the conversation.\n  \n- Sentence 6 (Neighbors A apologized to Neighbors B for their behavior and admitted to being wrong) could be related to past interactions and offer context for their relationship, but it doesnâ€™t contribute directly to the context of the current conversation about strength.\n\nThe remaining sentences, particularly 2, 3, and 5, do not clearly connect to the context of showing physical strength or capability, nor do they substantially develop the understanding of the relationship dynamics relevant to the current dialogue context. \n\nOverall, the MEMORY has some elements that are helpful and demonstrate a partial understanding of their interactions, but it lacks a clear and direct connection to the specific context of the current conversation, limiting its usefulness to generate a response."
