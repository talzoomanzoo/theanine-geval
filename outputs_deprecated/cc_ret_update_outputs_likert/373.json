Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message. Co-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident. Co-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows. Co-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive. Co-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right. Co-workers B: Speaking of convincing people, have you ever been in a physical altercation before? Co-workers A: Yes, unfortunately. But that doesn't mean I'm a danger to people. I just don't back down from a fight when I'm standing up for what's right. Co-workers B: That's understandable. Speaking of standing up for what's right, do you remember when you asked Karen for money and she was hesitant at first? Co-workers A: Yeah, I remember. But she eventually gave me the cash, and I was able to take care of what I needed to. Co-workers B: That's good. And speaking of taking care of things, your carpentry skills are amazing. I loved the house you built for me last year. Co-workers A: Thanks! I really love building houses. It's a great feeling to take a blueprint and turn it into someone's dream home. Co-workers B: You're a true professional. Speaking of professional skills, your speech at the rally really moved the crowd. You have a great way with words.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs.\n2. Co-worker A is a skilled builder who recently completed building a house for Co-worker B.\n3. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument.\n4. Co-worker A has experience dealing with challenging clients and emphasizes the importance of communication and setting expectations.\n5. Co-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\n6. Co-worker A appreciates the support and hard work put into the case.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you so much for the kind words. I believe that clear communication and connecting with the audience are key in delivering a powerful message.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a proper response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences in the MEMORY offer insights into Co-worker A's skills and experiences, such as standing up for their beliefs, building houses, and presenting compelling arguments. These details align with the context of the dialogue. However, some sentences, like those about dealing with challenging clients and emphasizing communication, are not directly relevant to the current dialogue flow. Additionally, while the MEMORY provides some useful information, it could be more connected and relevant to the immediate conversational topics in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as public speaking and past interactions with Co-worker B. Overall, the MEMORY is somewhat structured and provides some context, but it lacks a clear focus on the specific conversation at hand."
