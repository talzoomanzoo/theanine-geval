Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n2. Neighbor B is against Neighbor A's idea, emphasizing the ethical and legal implications.\n3. Neighbor A has skills in manipulation and getting what they want.\n4. Neighbor A considers Neighbor B a great neighbor and wanted to do something special for them.\n5. Neighbors A values their friendship with Neighbors B, describing them as a great neighbor.\n6. Neighbor A and Neighbor B discuss organizing a community event to make a positive impact and appreciate the beauty of their city.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some elements that could potentially be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Neighbor A's struggle with focus and procrastination and Neighbor B's viewpoints on ethics and legality. However, the connections between these past interactions and the current dialogue are not clearly demonstrated. The entries in the MEMORY are somewhat disjointed and do not naturally lead to the current situation of meeting a project deadline or addressing procrastination. While sentences like Neighbor A's consideration of using skills for good may seem related to improving focus, this connection is not explicitly stated, reducing the overall helpfulness. Furthermore, many sentences focus on friendships and community events, which are not directly relevant to the current focus-related struggle. Overall, the MEMORY lacks clarity in relevance and development of past interactions in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, thus receiving a lower score."
