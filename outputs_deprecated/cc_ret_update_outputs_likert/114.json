Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I really enjoy being a carpenter. It's a very fulfilling job. Classmates B: That's great to hear! How did you get into carpentry?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A is attending a seminar on starting a business and is excited about applying that knowledge to future plans.\n2. Classmates B is supportive and encourages Classmates A in their business venture.\n3. Classmates A wants to get to know Classmates B better and become friends.\n4. Classmates A is willing to work hard and learn the necessary strategies for business success.\n5. Classmate B offers to support and potentially collaborate with Classmate A in the future.\n6. Classmate A has always loved singing but never thought it was possible until now.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've always been interested in working with my hands and creating things since I was young. When I realized I could turn that passion into a career, I knew I had to pursue it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains information that is not very relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While there is some mention of classmate interactions (e.g., support from Classmate B and willingness of Classmate A to work hard), most of the MEMORY revolves around topics such as starting a business or singing, which do not pertain to the discussion about carpentry. The sentences are more about generic supportive or aspirational interactions rather than providing direct context or causality to the conversation about carpentry. The language model would have difficulty using this MEMORY to inform Classmate Aâ€™s journey into carpentry or provide a clear narrative for the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. There is an evident lack of specific connection and development related to how Classmate A got into carpentry or the dynamics surrounding it."
