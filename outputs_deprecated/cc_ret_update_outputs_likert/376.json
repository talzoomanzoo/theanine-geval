    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to share something with you. I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend. Classmates B: That's really kind of you. What did you do to help? Classmates A: She was moving and needed some extra hands to pack up her things and load them onto a truck. So I spent most of the day helping her out.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support.\n2. Classmates B handled a previous mix-up with the class schedule well, showing responsibility and reliability.\n3. Classmates A appreciates the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n4. Classmates A and B are making plans to spend time together outside of school.\n5. Classmates A and B started as acquaintances and have developed a strong friendship.\n6. Both Classmates A and B are looking forward to hanging out outside of school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Wow, that's so thoughtful of you to lend a helping hand! Your neighbor must have been really grateful for your assistance. It's great to see you making a positive impact in your community.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about the relationship between Classmates A and B, indicating they have developed a strong friendship and appreciate each other's support. This information is useful to some extent in understanding the positive rapport they share, as demonstrated in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Classmate B responds supportively to Classmate A's actions. However, the MEMORY could be more directly relevant by including details more closely related to the specific event of helping a neighbor move. While it establishes a foundation of friendship and mutual appreciation, it lacks specific past interactions or events that connect closely to the current dialogue about helping a neighbor, thus limiting its helpfulness."
