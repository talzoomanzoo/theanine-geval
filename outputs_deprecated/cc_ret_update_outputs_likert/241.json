Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that. Neighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset? Neighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore. Neighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it? Neighbors A: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end job. Neighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you considered looking for a new job? Neighbors A: I have, but with the current job market, it's really tough. Plus, I don't have a lot of experience in other fields. Neighbors B: Well, I'll keep an ear out for any job openings that might be a good fit for you. In the meantime, maybe try finding ways to de-stress after work? I find that exercise helps me when I'm feeling frustrated.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\n2. Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received.\n3. Neighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship as neighbors.\n4. Neighbors A wants to rearrange their living room and Neighbors B has experience with rearranging furniture.\n5. Neighbors A is detail-oriented and strives for perfection.\n6. Neighbors B values reciprocity and acknowledges the mutual help between them as neighbors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's really thoughtful of you, I appreciate the support. I'll definitely take your advice on de-stressing after work. Thanks for always being there for me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several sentences that offer a general understanding of the relationship between Neighbors A and B, highlighting their supportive and helpful dynamic. Specifically, sentence 1 about Neighbors B being supportive and understanding is relevant to the context, as it mirrors the dialogue where Neighbors B is offering advice and understanding towards Neighbors A's job frustration. Sentences 2 and 3 also reflect the positive interactions between the two, though not directly referenced in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 4 and 5 are not relevant to the dialogue context about work-related stress but are phrased naturally. They provide context into past interactions but not directly helpful for generating the next response in the specific situation discussed in the context. Thus, MEMORY provides some helpful background but lacks significant specific relevance to the given dialogue context."
