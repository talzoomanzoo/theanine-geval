Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nAthlete: Ted Athlete unrolls the map. He looks at it for a few moments before tracing his finger along one of the highways. \"This is our route,\" he says finally, feeling in control.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Athlete is focused on helping the team succeed and has shown leadership qualities during warm-ups and stretches.\n2. The Athlete is focused on improving their performance and energy levels.\n3. The Athlete usually likes the flavor of the gum but is finding it distracting in this instance.\n4. The Athlete seeks approval and praise from the Coach.\n5. The Athlete has been taking on more responsibilities and has gained respect from other players.\n6. The Coach encourages the Athlete to keep up the good work and acknowledges their achievements.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful context about the Athlete's character, leadership qualities, and interactions with the Coach, which can be used to generate a relevant response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 4, 5, and 6 provide context on the Athlete's leadership and his relationship with the team and the Coach, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where the Athlete is displaying control and decisiveness. However, sentences 2 and 3 seem less directly related to the current context. Sentence 3, in particular, about the Athlete's preference for gum flavor, seems unrelated to the navigation scenario and may distract from the narrative. The MEMORY could be more helpfully connected and concise in illustrating the Athlete's character and current situation, but overall it provides a reasonable level of background information to support generating a response."
