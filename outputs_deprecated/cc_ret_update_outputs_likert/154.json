Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today. Classmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about? Classmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held. Classmates B: Wow, that does sound interesting. Did you take any notes? Classmates A: Yes, I took lots of notes. I'm excited to study this topic more on my own time. Classmates B: That's awesome. It's great to see your enthusiasm for learning.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B noticed Classmates A's improvement and acknowledged their hard work.\n2. Classmate B is working on finishing a history project.\n3. Classmates A's grades are looking good according to their teacher.\n4. Classmates A had a moment of frustration in the past but has learned to channel that energy into studies.\n5. Classmate B is interested in attending a new technology conference next month.\n6. Classmates B recalls a funny moment from high school involving Classmates A wearing pajamas to school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks! I've been trying to channel my energy into my studies, and it's been paying off. Your history project must be keeping you busy too. How's it coming along?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant aspects, such as Classmates A's enthusiasm for learning and improvement, which correlate with the topic of the dialogue about education and interest in a specific subject. However, there is a lack of direct or coherent relevance to the specific conversation topic, which is about a talk on the history of the pyramids in Egypt. Most of the sentences focus on unrelated details like a technology conference or a funny moment involving pajamas, which don't aid in creating continuity or clear development related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, although some information about academic improvement (sentence 1 and 3) might help understand the dynamic between classmates, it doesn't provide specific cues or connections to the detailed subject matter (talk and notes on pyramids) in context. Therefore, the MEMORY minimally supports generating a useful response in the dialogue."
