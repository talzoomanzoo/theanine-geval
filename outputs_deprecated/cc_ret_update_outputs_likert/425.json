Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me. Co-workers B: That's amazing to hear. Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job. Co-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work. Co-workers B: It's great to have that kind of positive reinforcement. Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated? Co-workers A: Oh yeah, I remember. I was so angry after blowing up that rabbit with the dynamite. But talking it out with you really helped me work through my emotions. Co-workers B: That's right. It's important to have someone to talk to when you're feeling overwhelmed or upset.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.\n2. Co-worker A and Co-worker B met on a movie set and are now good friends.\n3. Co-worker A had a tough week on set, feeling overwhelmed and chaotic.\n4. Co-worker B and Co-worker A met on a movie set where Co-worker A was focused on acting.\n5. Co-worker A and Co-worker B are excited about working on future projects together and even starting their own production company someday.\n6. Co-worker B acknowledges that some people have fears and suggests finding healthy ways to deal with frustrations.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, having someone to talk to and support you during tough times can make a huge difference. I'm glad we were able to work through that together on set.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided is quite helpful in generating a response for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as it provides several relevant contextual cues. Sentences 1 and 2 directly reference the past collaboration between the co-workers, which is a key element of the dialogue context where they discuss the impact of supportive interactions and past experiences working together. Sentence 3 provides insight into Co-worker A's emotional struggles, which is relevant to A's mention of feeling frustrated during the past project. Sentence 5 provides context for their future aspirations, which ties into their positive relationship developed through the support mentioned in the dialogue. However, sentences 4 and 6, while naturally structured, do not add substantial benefit specifically to the given dialogue context. Overall, the memory outlines the development of the relationship between the two co-workers and their past interactions effectively, thus aiding in generating a coherent and contextually aware response."
