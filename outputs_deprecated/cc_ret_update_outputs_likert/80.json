Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret? Neighbors B: Of course, what's up? Neighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door. Neighbors B: Oh, why are you hiding from her? Neighbors A: She wants me to go to a family dinner tonight, but I'm too tired and just want to relax at home. Neighbors B: Maybe you should talk to her about it and let her know how you feel. Neighbors A: I know, but I don't want to disappoint her. Neighbors B: It's important to take care of your own needs and speak up for yourself. Plus, maybe you can compromise and go to the dinner for a little while and then come back home to relax. Neighbors A: That's a good idea, thanks for the advice. Neighbors B: No problem. Speaking of compromise, remember that dinner we went to a few days ago?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation.\n2. Neighbor B offers support and suggests planning a dinner to celebrate Neighbor A's new adventures in learning.\n3. Neighbors B is open to trying new recipes and is excited to receive the chickpea curry recipe from Neighbors A.\n4. Neighbors A made a roasted vegetable and quinoa dish that Neighbors B enjoyed.\n5. Neighbors B is excited and supportive of Neighbors A's new ability.\n6. Neighbors A enjoys trying new things, like new recipes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around Neighbors A hiding from their mother to avoid a family dinner. The MEMORY primarily contains information about past interactions involving cooking and trying new recipes. Although it does indicate some level of connection between the neighbors, such as their interest in cooking and supporting each other's ventures, it does not provide helpful contextual cues for generating a response in the current situation discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences do not appear to have a direct impact on the development of the current dialogue about hiding from a family event, nor do they offer insights into the emotional dynamics or shared experiences pertinent to the present conversation. Thus, they offer limited benefit for creating a relevant next response."
