Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends. Mentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections. Mentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here. Mentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people. Mentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n2. Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process.\n3. The Mentee has been offered a job and has decided to take the job in the city.\n4. The Mentee weighed the pros and cons of each option before deciding on the job in the city.\n5. Mentee agreed to go back to the store to make things right and expressed gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n6. The Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided lacks immediate relevance and connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Although it provides some insight into the past interactions between Mentor and Mentee, such as Mentee's decision to take a job in the city and Mentee's gratitude towards Mentor's advice, these memories do not directly address the main concern of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Mentee is feeling lonely and uncertain about making new friends in a new city.\n\nThe sentences lack coherence and continuity related to the context of loneliness and building new connections, which is the focus of the dialogue between Mentee and Mentor. While some aspects, like the Mentor's reassuring nature, might tangentially relate, the MEMORY does not effectively aid in forming a response that naturally extends or addresses the current concerns presented in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\nThus, the MEMORY provides limited helpfulness for generating a relevant and contextually appropriate next response in the ongoing conversation about loneliness and adapting to a new environment."
