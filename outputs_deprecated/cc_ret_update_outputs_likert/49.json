Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today? Co-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health.\n2. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\n3. Co-worker A feels motivated about the future and is excited to work with Co-worker B.\n4. Co-worker A values their health to continue working at their best.\n5. Co-workers A and B have a positive and optimistic attitude towards their future collaboration.\n6. Co-worker B is impressed with Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Don't hesitate to reach out if you need any help. Your well-being is just as important as the workload.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a significant amount of helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It accurately describes the mutual support, encouragement, and positive dynamic between Co-workers A and B. The MEMORY highlights Co-worker B's supportive nature and Co-worker A's motivation and excitement, which may aid in shaping an encouraging or motivational response in context. Although not all specific sentences in the MEMORY directly address the workload discussion, they are structured coherently and offer contextual cues regarding the supportive relationship between the coworkers, which is highly relevant to continuing the conversation. Hence, the MEMORY's content is both relevant and useful for crafting an appropriate response."
