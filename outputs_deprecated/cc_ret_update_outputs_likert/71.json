Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A is overwhelmed but also excited about their new ability.\n2. Neighbors B is excited and supportive of Neighbors A's new ability.\n3. Neighbors A has been practicing moving small objects with their telekinesis.\n4. Neighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation.\n5. Neighbors A enjoys trying new things, like new recipes.\n6. Neighbors A has gained the ability to move objects with their mind.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that could help generate a proper next response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, MEMORY sentence 1 mentions Neighbors A being overwhelmed and excited about a new ability, which aligns with the context of keeping a secret. Sentence 6 clearly states that Neighbors A has the ability to move objects with their mind, which is likely the secret Neighbors A is referencing. Sentence 3 provides additional context about Neighbors A practicing this ability, indicating development in their journey. Sentence 2 demonstrates Neighbors B's supportive attitude, which could inform the tone of their response to the secret.\n\nWhile sentences 4 and 5 about cooking do not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, they are naturally phrased. However, due to limited direct relevance of some sentences, the MEMORY does not achieve a perfect score. Overall, the MEMORY is quite helpful in generating a response, but small improvements could enhance the interconnectedness and relevance of all sentences."
