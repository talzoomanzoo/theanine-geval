    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned? Classmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed. Classmates A: Embarrassed? Why? Classmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier. Classmates A: Come on, tell me! I won't judge you, I promise. Classmates B: Well, I accidentally spilled my lunch all over myself in front of some people. Classmates A: (laughs) That's it? That's why you're embarrassed? I thought it was something serious. Classmates B: (sighs) Yeah, it's silly. But still embarrassing. Classmates A: Don't worry about it. It happens to everyone. Remember the time I tripped and fell in front of the whole class during our presentation? Classmates B: Oh yeah, that was pretty bad. But you handled it so well. You just got up, dusted yourself off, and continued with the presentation. Classmates A: Exactly! That's what you should do too. Own up to it and move on. Don't let it bother you. Classmates B: You're right. Thanks, Classmates A. You always know how to make me feel better.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during the difficult situation.\n2. Classmates B praised Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n3. Classmates A helped Classmates B out of friendship and believes in supporting each other.\n4. Classmate B struggles with parallel parking but is grateful for Classmate A's patience.\n5. Classmate A believes in doing their best at everything to avoid regrets later.\n6. Classmates B also mentioned that Classmates A helped them prepare for a driving test, showing patience and dedication.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "No problem, Classmates B. We all have our embarrassing moments, but it's how we handle them that counts. Just remember, we're all in this together and here to support each other.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some sentences that might be somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT in terms of the relationship between Classmates A and B. There are themes of mutual support, gratitude, and helping each other with challenges which can reflect their supportive interaction as in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the specific situations described in the MEMORY (such as space experiences or driving tests) are not directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding embarrassment over spilling lunch. The lack of direct relevance limits the MEMORYâ€™s usefulness in generating a response related to the current dialogue. The MEMORY needs to include more directly relevant past interactions that connect with the specific scenario discussed in the context to be rated higher."
