Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness.\n2. Classmate A and Classmate B are classmates.\n3. Classmates A has not experienced similar pains in the past and is feeling worried about the situation.\n4. Classmates A is competitive and recently beat their brother in a race.\n5. Classmate A emphasizes the importance of self-care and relaxation.\n6. Classmates B emphasizes the importance of enjoying the journey and effort put in, not just focusing on winning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! Your determination and competitiveness will surely pay off.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant context about the relationship and personalities of Classmates A and B, which could be somewhat helpful in generating the next response. Sentences 1 and 6 present Classmates B's perspective and attitude, which might be relevant to a discussion about studying, competition, or effort, aligning with Classmates A's focus on studying algebra. Sentences 4 and 5 provide background on Classmates A's competitive nature and emphasis on self-care, which can inform the language model's understanding of Classmates A's character. However, Sentences 2 and 3 do not offer significant insight or relevance to the current dialogue context. Overall, while some connections are clear, the development and causality between the sentences aren't fully demonstrated, leading to a moderate score."
