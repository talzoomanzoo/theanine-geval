Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager! Co-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role. Co-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge. Co-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail. Co-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader.\n2. Co-worker B acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress.\n3. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n4. Co-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication.\n5. Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\n6. Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fantastic to hear! Your ability to communicate and inspire the team will surely lead to some amazing projects. Your growth and confidence over the years have truly paid off.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about Co-worker A's aspiration for leadership and past personal growth, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Co-worker A is discussing a promotion. The MEMORY indicates Co-worker A's desire to take on more responsibility and growth towards leadership (sentence 1, 4), which is related to the current promotion scenario. Co-worker B's supportive attitude mentioned in sentence 2 is consistent with the positive reinforcement in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, some sentences in the MEMORY (e.g., 5 and 6) are repetitive and do not add significant additional context or development to the conversation at hand. Therefore, while there is some helpful information contained in the MEMORY, the overall structure and phrasing of the sentences could be improved for clarity and to enhance the connectivity of past interactions, warranting a score in the middle range."
