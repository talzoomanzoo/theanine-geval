Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me. Co-workers B: That's amazing to hear. Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job. Co-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A is grateful for life experiences and is open to new possibilities in the future.\n2. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.\n3. Co-worker B emphasized the importance of learning from mistakes and working together as a team.\n4. Co-worker A has grown as a person and as an artist, learning about empathy and compassion.\n5. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to try relaxation techniques or find a hobby to de-stress and overcome fears.\n6. Co-worker A and Co-worker B are excited about working on future projects together and even starting their own production company someday.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad to hear that. When you feel supported and valued, it really does wonders for your morale and productivity. Your positive attitude is contagious, and it's a pleasure to work alongside someone who is so dedicated and motivated.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that could help generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, memories 2, 3, and 6 are particularly supportive of the context as they could tie into the theme of feeling secure and motivated in one's job, as well as emphasizing collaboration and future prospects. However, the rest of the MEMORY, including appreciation for life experiences, personal growth, and discussing relaxation techniques, are less directly connected to the given context about having a supportive boss and focusing on the workplace environment. While these elements do provide some background on Co-worker A and B's relationship, they don't strongly illuminate the dialogue's subject matter. Additionally, the connection and causality in some parts could be clearer to ensure the language model can easily identify important contextual cues."
