Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Thank you for finding my glasses for me, Mentor. I always seem to misplace them. Mentor: Not a problem, Mentee.

    "raw_prediction": "That's wonderful to hear, Mentee. Living in the moment is such a powerful practice, especially on your journey to sobriety. It's amazing to see how you're embracing mindfulness and finding joy in the present. Keep up the great work!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It effectively captures the main themes and sentiments expressed in the dialogue, such as Mentor's support and pride in Mentee's positive changes, Mentee's focus on sobriety and living in the moment, and the ongoing mentor-mentee relationship. The MEMORY includes details like Mentee's history of substance abuse, their commitment to sobriety, and the incorporation of new habits like yoga for mental and physical health. While there are a few sentences that are not directly connected to the immediate dialogue context (e.g., incorporating yoga), these sentences are naturally structured and relevant to the overall context of Mentee's journey and growth. The MEMORY provides a coherent view of the relationship between the speakers and highlights key points that could be useful for generating informed and contextually aware responses."
