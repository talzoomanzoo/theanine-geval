Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life. Child: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you. Parent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you. Child: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you? Parent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference. Child: I'm glad you found someone to talk to. You know, I remember when we watched the sunrise together a few weeks ago. That was really special. Parent: It was. I love being able to appreciate the beauty of nature. And you know, having my own place to live in the suburbs makes it even easier to do things like that.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n3. The Parent eventually got to see the sunrise after leaving detention.\n4. Both the parent and child enjoy spending time together in their new home.\n5. The Parent and Child plan to watch the sunrise together in the future.\n6. The parent now lives in a little house in the suburbs that they love.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information to help the language model, representing the Child, generate an appropriate next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory includes relevant information about the Parent's past experiences, the meaningful connection between the parent and the child, and a shared appreciation for moments like watching the sunrise. The details about the Parent finding hope and appreciating small moments, and the child finding the Parent's story inspiring, are directly related to the dialogue context about listening and finding someone who understands. The mention of enjoying time together and living in a little house in the suburbs connects well with the dialogue about appreciating beauty and the Parent having their own place. However, the mention of planning to watch the sunrise together in the future might not be as directly applicable to the immediate context, hence the score is not a full 5. Overall, the memory is well-structured, with meaningful connections and relevant contexts that support the conversation effectively."
