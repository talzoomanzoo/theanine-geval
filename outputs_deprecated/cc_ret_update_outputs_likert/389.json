Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway? Wife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go? Husband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city. Wife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change. Husband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think? Wife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it. Husband: Great. I'll start looking for rental cabins right away. I know this may sound impulsive, but I'm really excited to make this happen. Wife: Don't worry, husband, it's not impulsive. You always follow through with your plans, and I believe this will be a wonderful experience for both of us.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband is excited about his progress on long-awaited plans and is putting in a lot of effort to make them a reality.\n2.

The husband and wife are committed to each other and excited about their future together.\n5. The husband values the wife's encouragement and positivity in his pursuit of his goals.\n6. The wife is supportive and proud of her husband for working towards his goals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which centers around the husband and wife planning a weekend getaway and their excitement about spending time together. The MEMORY captures the husband's excitement about his plans (sentences 1 and 4) and his determination to make them happen, which aligns with the conversation about the weekend getaway. It also highlights the wife's support and encouragement (sentence 6), which is relevant since she expresses eagerness and faith in the getaway plans. Additionally, the commitment and excitement about their future together mentioned in the MEMORY (sentence 4) complements the idea of planning a getaway and enjoying time together. However, some sentences, such as sentence 2 and 3, do not directly connect to the context of the getaway planning, as they refer to actions and promises outside the current dialogue. Overall, MEMORY captures a sense of mutual support and excitement that aids the model in generating appropriate responses but could be more directly linked to the specific getaway context."
