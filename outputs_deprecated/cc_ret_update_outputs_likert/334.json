    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going? Neighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you? Neighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band. Neighbors B: Really? You had a band? Neighbors A: Yeah, we were called \"The Neighbors A Band.\" We used to play live shows around the city. Neighbors B: That's awesome! What kind of music did you guys play? Neighbors A: We played rock music, mostly covers but we also wrote some of our own songs.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbors B is familiar with Neighbors A's dog and looking forward to playing with it again.\n3. Neighbors A is enjoying the different culture and exploring the city.\n4. Neighbors B expresses concern for Neighbors A's back pain.\n5. Neighbor B is interested in chiropractic care after hearing about Neighbor A's positive experience.\n6. Neighbor A offered to provide the name of their chiropractor to Neighbor B if they decide to go.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The memory provided does not directly relate to the current dialogue context, where Neighbors A and B are discussing the past musical career of Neighbors A. The sentences in the memory generally do not contain relevant information that would help generate a proper response in the given context. The topics in the memory revolve around support, friendship, a dog, back pain, and chiropractic care, which are disconnected from the music conversation in the dialogue context. As a result, the memory does not provide helpful information to develop or continue the current topic of discussion."
