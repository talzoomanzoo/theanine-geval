Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: It's great to have friends who can help each other out, isn't it? Neighbors B: Absolutely. It's a two-way street, and it's important to be there for each other.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the suggestion.\n2. Neighbors B emphasized the importance of apologizing to show care for the relationship.\n3. Neighbors A bought a necklace from Neighbors B's shop and loves it.\n4. Both neighbors express the difficulty of not being able to adopt all the animals they see but appreciate those who do adopt and give them loving homes.\n5. Neighbors B offered to help Neighbors A with the apology process.\n6. Neighbors A was looking for a new necklace and stumbled upon Neighbors B's shop.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Definitely! I really appreciate your offer to help me with the apology process. It means a lot to have friends like you who are willing to support and guide me through tough situations.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains details about past interactions between Neighbors A and B that can be useful for generating a relevant response. For instance, Neighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the suggestion (1), and Neighbors B offered help in the apology process (5), both of which hint at a supportive relationship which aligns with the theme of helping each other in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, some parts of the MEMORY, like the dialogue about the necklace from Neighbors B's shop (3, 6), while naturally phrased and connected, are not immediately relevant to the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about mutual help. This results in a moderately helpful MEMORY, with some sentences fitting well with the context but others less directly connected."
