Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away. Co-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that. Co-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way. Co-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you. Co-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it. Co-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n3. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's positivity and friendship.\n4. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\n5. Co-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\n6. Co-worker A intervened to help two women who were fighting, showing bravery and a desire to make a positive impact.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I understand that you're feeling strongly about this, but it's important to respect the bride's autonomy and wishes. It's not healthy to try to control someone else's life or decisions. Let's focus on supporting her happiness, even if it means letting go.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly the first sentence about Co-worker A borrowing a pencil without asking and feeling guilty about it. This directly connects to Co-worker A's comparison of their feelings about the bride to the pencil incident. However, the rest of the MEMORY is not directly related to the current dialogue context. Sentences about Co-worker B suggesting coffee and appreciating Co-worker A's positivity, Co-worker B's willingness to help, Co-worker A needing time to adjust, and Co-worker A's past intervention to help two women do not directly contribute to the conversation about the bride situation. They are naturally phrased, providing general context about the characters' relationship and personalities, but they don't offer specific cues related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, they are less helpful in generating a relevant next response."
