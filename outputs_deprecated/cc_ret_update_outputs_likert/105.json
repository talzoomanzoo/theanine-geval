Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become? Neighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A noticed some wood near their backyard and asked Neighbor B if they had seen it too.\n2. Neighbors B appreciates Neighbors A's handy skills.\n3. Neighbors A and B are observing wood that appears to be freshly cut from a tree.\n4. Neighbors A values double-checking before leaving the house.\n5. Neighbors A apologized to Neighbors B for their behavior and admitted to being wrong.\n6. Neighbors A is good at fixing things, particularly electronics.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains information about Neighbor A and Neighbor B's past interactions, but it lacks direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context is focused on Neighbor A's physical strength and possible workout routines, while the MEMORY primarily discusses other unrelated topics, such as wood observation, handy skills, apologies, and fixing electronics. Although some entries like Neighbor B appreciating Neighbor A's handy skills might indirectly suggest physical capabilities, the connection is not strong enough to aid in generating a coherent response related to the current conversation about strength and workouts. Additionally, the development or causality of the interactions within the MEMORY is not clearly demonstrated, making it challenging for a language model to glean useful contextual cues for crafting the next response."
