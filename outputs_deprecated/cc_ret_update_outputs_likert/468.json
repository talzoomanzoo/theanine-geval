    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing! Neighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go? Neighbors A: I visited Brazil and Peru. The culture and food were incredible. Neighbors B: That sounds awesome. I've always wanted to go to Peru to see Machu Picchu.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and B believe in doing nice things for others to bring the community together.\n2. Neighbors A and B both took a cooking class together last year.\n3. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's organization skills and wishes to improve their own organization.\n4. Both Neighbors A and B believe in the importance of learning and self-improvement.\n5. Neighbor A is feeling frustrated and is considering going to a bar to find someone for a casual encounter.\n6. Neighbors A saw George at the store and exchanged waves.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You should definitely plan a trip there! Machu Picchu is truly breathtaking. I can share some travel tips with you if you're interested.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does not provide much helpful information for generating a next response based on the provided DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Although there are some details about the interactions between Neighbors A and B, such as attending a cooking class together and their shared belief in self-improvement, these points are not directly related to the conversation about the trip to South America. Furthermore, some memory items, like the one about Neighbors A considering going to a bar for a casual encounter, are irrelevant and could potentially confuse the model more than assist it in generating a suitable response in relation to the travel discussion. Therefore, the MEMORY lacks directly useful content for the current dialogue context, and its helpfulness is limited."
