    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that. Neighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset? Neighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore. Neighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it? Neighbors A: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end job. Neighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you considered looking for a new job?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\n2. Neighbors A wants to rearrange their living room and Neighbors B has experience with rearranging furniture.\n3. Neighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship as neighbors.\n4. Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received.\n5. Neighbors A is detail-oriented and strives for perfection.\n6. Neighbors B values reciprocity and acknowledges the mutual help between them as neighbors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information regarding the relationship between Neighbors A and B. Memories 1, 3, and 6 indicate that Neighbors B is supportive and they have a positive, reciprocal relationship. This context is relevant as it establishes why Neighbors B might be understanding and empathetic in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, other memories like 2, 4, and 5 are unrelated to the issue at hand (the work-related frustration) and don't contribute to developing an understanding of the current situation. While most of the sentences are naturally phrased, they don't provide much helpful insight specifically related to the discussion about Neighbors A's job frustration."
