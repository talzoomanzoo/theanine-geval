Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn. Teacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation? Student: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle. Teacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time? Student: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then. Teacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going? Student: It's going pretty well. I started with French, but now I'm considering taking up Spanish and German too. I want to become more well-rounded. Teacher: That's a great goal. Have you thought about any specific ways you could use your language skills? Student: I would love to be able to travel more and speak with the locals in their native language. Maybe I could even teach my grandchildren some basic phrases.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The student is studying French at college and plans on learning Spanish and German as well.\n2. The teacher speaks Spanish and French fluently.\n3. The teacher and student have a positive and understanding relationship.\n4. The student believes in the importance of continuous learning and growth.\n5. The teacher advises the student on effective communication and problem-solving, emphasizing the importance of talking calmly and finding solutions together.\n6. The student has already made plans with their daughter and son-in-law to visit more often and take the grandkids on trips.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a fantastic plan! Learning Spanish and German will definitely open up more opportunities for you to connect with people during your travels. And teaching your grandchildren some basic phrases will be such a special way to bond with them. Your continuous pursuit of growth and learning is truly inspiring.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides quite a bit of helpful information that supports the continuation of the dialogue, particularly regarding the topic of language learning. Specifically, memory points 1 and 4 are directly relevant to the dialogue context as they reiterate the student's interest in learning languages and their belief in continuous learning, which ties into the current topic where the student discusses language study ambitions. Memory point 3, which mentions the positive and understanding relationship between the student and the teacher, complements the supportive nature of the interaction seen in the dialogue. \n\nOn the other hand, points 2, 5, and 6 are somewhat less connected to the immediate context of the conversation â€” they could be relevant to other related discussions but not directly linked to the current language learning and travel focus. However, they are naturally constructed and may help the language model identify them as less beneficial to this specific context, without introducing confusion.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and supports the generation of a relevant response while maintaining coherence."
