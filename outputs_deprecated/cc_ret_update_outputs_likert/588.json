    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work. Wife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help. Husband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff. Wife: Nonsense! You can always come to me with anything. Plus, I enjoy helping you with your creative process. Have you also tried revisiting some of the writing prompts we did in our creative writing class?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Wife suggests that husband should try using more modern language to be better understood.\n2. Wife brings up Sarah, the husband's previous partner, but husband says he hasn't thought about her much.\n3. The wife compares the situation to when the husband fell asleep during a movie she recommended, indicating past issues in their relationship.\n4. Husband agrees to try adapting to modern language for better communication with his wife.\n5. The wife reassures the husband that it's okay to be different and encourages him to embrace who he is.\n6. The wife remembers the husband being nervous before the presentation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate your support, and you're right, revisiting those writing prompts could spark some new ideas. I'll give it a try and let you know how it goes. Thank you for always being there for me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides little directly helpful information related to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on the husband's writing struggles and his wife's offer to help with brainstorming and creative prompts. Meanwhile, the MEMORY contains scattered elements that could contribute to understanding their dynamics, but they do not directly connect to or support the specific conversation at hand about writing.\n\n1. The mention of modern language (sentences 1 and 4) might indirectly relate to creativity in writing, but it's not directly tied to brainstorming or writing prompts.\n2. Bringing up Sarah (sentence 2) or the movie incident (sentence 3) seems completely unrelated to the current conversation and does not provide helpful context for generating a response in this dialogue.\n3. The wife's reassurance about being oneself (sentence 5) and remembering the husband's nervousness (sentence 6) could indicate their supportive relationship, but again, they lack relevance to the writing issue mentioned.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY provides some insights into their relationship, it lacks specific, helpful content for advancing the current dialogue on writing struggles and brainstorming, leading to a low helpfulness score."
