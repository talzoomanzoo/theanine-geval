Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends. Mentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections. Mentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n2. Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process.\n3. The Mentee has been offered a job and has decided to take the job in the city.\n4. Mentee agreed to go back to the store to make things right and expressed gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n5. The Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process.\n6. Mentor emphasizes the importance of self-care for dealing with challenges.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's completely normal to feel that way, Mentee. Building new relationships takes time, so be patient with yourself. Maybe try joining some local clubs or organizations to meet people who share your interests.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information that might be helpful in understanding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but lacks direct relevance or strong connections to it. \n\n1. Sentence 1 is somewhat relevant because it portrays the mentor's reassurance, which aligns with the supportive role shown in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n2. Sentence 6, emphasizing self-care, could offer context for potential advice related to feeling lonely or adjusting to a new environment.\n3. Sentences 2, 3, 4, and 5 are less directly relevant to the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT about loneliness and making friends in a new city, although they do reveal aspects of the Mentee's past concerns and Mentor's past support.\n\nOverall, while MEMORY includes helpful elements showing the established mentor-mentee relationship, it could be better integrated with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT to offer more targeted insights about the Mentee's current situation. The sentences are naturally phrased but their connection and relevance to the conversation at hand are not as strong as they could be."
