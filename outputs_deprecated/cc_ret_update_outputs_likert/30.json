Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water? Neighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for. Neighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit. Neighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water. Neighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it. Neighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again. Neighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower? Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work. Neighbors A: It was. But it was also a good workout. Neighbors B: I prefer to work out indoors where there's air conditioning. Neighbors A: Ha, I remember when I took off my jacket and put my feet up in your armchair. It was so warm that day.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\n2. Neighbors B agrees that mowing the lawn is a lot of work but acknowledges the exercise it provides.\n3. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n4. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n5. Neighbors A mentioned mowing the lawn with an old push mower, indicating they are responsible for the yard work.\n6. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY outlines relevant past interactions between Neighbors A and B that align with the current conversation. Within the given MEMORY:\n\n1. Sentence 5 directly relates to the current dialogue where Neighbor A mentions mowing the lawn with an old push mower, which is a conversation topic in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n2. Sentences 1 and 2 enhance the understanding of the neighbors' shared activity and exercise perspective, which is part of their interaction.\n3. Sentence 4 relates to the lawn mowing theme and suggests Neighbor B's consideration, which can influence the tone of future dialogues positively.\n4. Sentence 6 provides background context indicating a long-standing relationship between the neighbors, which helps in understanding the dynamic of their interaction.\n   \nHowever, sentence 3 is less helpful as it introduces a conversation about indoor temperature, which isnâ€™t directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Even so, this sentence is phrased naturally such that it can be easily identified as not immediately relevant.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY mostly provides pertinent and naturally connected information that reflects the development and history of the neighbors' interactions, justifying a rating of 4 for helpfulness."
