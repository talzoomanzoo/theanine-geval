Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful. Co-workers B: Did you make sure to include all the necessary details? Co-workers A: Yes, I made sure to cover everything we talked about in the meeting. I even added some extra information that I thought could be useful. Co-workers B: That's smart thinking. It shows that you're invested in the company and want to make sure things run smoothly. Co-workers A: Thanks. I learned a lot from taking over the family business. It taught me the importance of being efficient and proactive. Co-workers B: I remember you telling me about that. It's amazing how much you've accomplished since then. Co-workers A: It's been a journey, but I'm glad to see the business flourishing. It gives me a sense of pride and accomplishment. Co-workers B: I can tell. You're always trying to find ways to improve things. Co-workers A: Exactly. That's why I felt a written report would be the best way to communicate the information to my boss. It saves time and ensures everything is organized. Co-workers B: Makes sense. I'm sure your boss will appreciate your efforts. Co-workers A: I hope so. I just want to make sure we're all on the same page and working towards our goals.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B appreciates the pen and thanks Co-worker A for the gesture.\n2. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a thoughtful gesture.\n3. Co-worker A took over their family's business a few years ago and it has improved since then.\n4. Co-worker B finished a project and sent it to the manager for review.\n5. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a symbol of trust in their professional relationship.\n6. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value trust in their personal and professional relationships.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a great approach. Building that clear communication and alignment is key to success in any business. Your dedication to efficiency and improvement really shines through in everything you do.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information that could inform the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Co-worker A taking over their family's business (point 3) which is relevant to the context where Co-worker A mentions learning a lot from that experience. This piece of memory helps establish Co-worker A's background and part of their motivation for being efficient and proactive, tying into their current actions and mindset discussed in the dialogue. Similarly, the mention of valuing trust in professional relationships (point 6) is somewhat relevant as it could subtly influence the dynamics between Co-worker A and Co-worker B.\n\nHowever, other sentences in the MEMORY, such as those relating to the pen (points 1, 2, 5), seem disconnected from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These actions related to a pen do not provide significant insight into the current conversation or add to its development. Additionally, while the MEMORY presents individual thoughts related to their interaction, the connections or causality among these thoughts could be clearer, which would make this information more cohesively woven into the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, the MEMORY offers a middling level of helpfulness due to its partial relevance and lack of fully integrated, naturally connected sentences."
