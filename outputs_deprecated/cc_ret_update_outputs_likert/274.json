Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel really fulfilled as a leader and guide. Helping others gives me a sense of purpose.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B values finding fulfillment in work, pursuing hobbies, making a difference in the world, and building relationships with others.\n2. Co-worker A had a positive experience with a commander who helped them feel safe.\n3. Co-worker B emphasizes the importance of acknowledging privileges and using them to make the world a better place.\n4. Co-worker A believes that everyone has the ability to create opportunities and make their own luck through hard work and seizing opportunities.\n5. Co-worker A values making money and is interested in opportunities to do so.\n6. Co-worker A is self-aware about being stubborn and needing to learn to compromise.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's wonderful to hear that you find fulfillment in guiding others. Making a positive impact on people's lives is truly rewarding.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information that could be considered helpful for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, sentences 1, 3, and 4 provide context about the values and beliefs of Co-worker B and Co-worker A, which could be relevant given Co-worker A's mention of feeling fulfilled in a leadership role. Sentence 1 reflects Co-worker B's values, which align with Co-worker A's feelings of fulfillment. However, many of the sentences in MEMORY do not demonstrate clear causality or connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as sentence 5 about making money and sentence 6 about being stubborn. This implies a moderate level of helpfulness overall, as the MEMORY lacks coherence and direct relevance in some parts, though it could still provide useful context."
