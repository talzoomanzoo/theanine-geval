Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I just finished my computer course, and I learned so much about using computers effectively. Classmates B: That's great! What did you learn specifically? Classmates A: Oh, a lot of things. I learned how to use different programs and software for different tasks, and how to choose the right one depending on what I need to do. Classmates B: Do you have any software recommendations for me? I always struggle with choosing the right program. Classmates A: It really depends on what you need the software for. But for basic tasks like word processing or spreadsheet management, I would recommend Microsoft Office. It's user-friendly and versatile. Classmates B: Thanks, I'll keep that in mind. Did you learn anything else in the course? Classmates A: Yeah, I also learned some basic coding languages like HTML and CSS. It was challenging but really interesting.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and Classmates B are friends who help each other with schoolwork.\n2. Classmate B is a supportive friend who listens and offers to help.\n3. Classmates B and Classmates A used to dance a lot in middle school.\n4. Classmates A has matured since then and learned from past mistakes.\n5. Classmate A appreciates having friends who are there for them during difficult times.\n6. Classmates B supported Classmates A through a tough time by listening to them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Learning coding languages like HTML and CSS sounds like a valuable skill. It's great to see how much you've grown in your knowledge of computers and software. If you ever need help with coding or anything else, I'm here to support you as always.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about the relationship between Classmates A and B, indicating that they are friends who help each other with schoolwork and that Classmate B is supportive. However, it lacks detailed information relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding the computer course and software learning. There is little connection between the MEMORY sentences and the ongoing conversation about software and coding. While it mentions Classmates A maturing and appreciating supportive friends, which could be indirectly related, it does not directly provide helpful cues for generating the next response in the context of this specific technology-related discussion."
