Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, have you ever tried to imagine what it would be like to think like someone else? Mentor: Yes, I have. It's a great way to better understand and empathize with others.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor became a mentor to help others going through similar situations.\n2. Mentee wants to make a positive impact in people's lives and is grateful for Mentor's support.\n3. Mentee agrees to try the advice and express gratitude towards Mentor.\n4. Mentor encourages Mentee to approach teaching religion with an open mind and heart.\n5. Mentee has been thinking about helping others who may be in abusive cults.\n6. Mentee agrees to teach in a way that allows people to make their own decisions about their beliefs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I think that's a really important skill to have, especially when trying to help and support others. Being able to put yourself in someone else's shoes can make a big difference in how you approach teaching and supporting them.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains multiple points of information, with some relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, items 1 and 2 reveal the Mentor and Mentee's motivations, which align with their interest in understanding others, as mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, item 5 connects with the theme of empathy and understanding towards others' situations. However, other pieces, such as items 3, 4, and 6, are less directly connected to the current context. They don't offer much help for generating a direct response for the ongoing dialogue. The sentences are naturally phrased, but the development and causality are not very evident across the MEMORY, leading to an average score."
