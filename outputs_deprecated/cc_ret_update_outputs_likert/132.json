Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss! Co-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes. Co-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan. Co-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway. Co-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way. Co-workers B: And sometimes it is, but we all have different ideas and perspectives to bring to the table. Co-workers A: Okay, I see your point. I'll try to be more open-minded in the future. Co-workers B: That's all we can ask for. Remember that we're a team and we all have something valuable to contribute. Co-workers A: You're right. I'm glad we can have these conversations and work towards being better together. Co-workers B: Me too. Speaking of working together, do you remember when you gave me back my watch a few months ago? That meant a lot to me. Co-workers A: Of course I remember! I'm happy we're friends again.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.\n2. Co-worker A returned a watch to Co-worker B, making them happy again.\n3. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B enjoy taking moments to connect with each other and find these moments make work more enjoyable.\n4. Co-worker A has a history of helping out Co-worker B and values their friendship.\n5. Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues.\n6. Co-worker A returned Co-worker B's watch a few years ago, leading to the rekindling of their friendship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a helpful summary of the dynamic between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, which aids in generating a response aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it reinforces the mutual respect and prior positive interactions between them, which are important contextual cues. For instance, Memory 2 directly relates to the mention of the watch in the dialogue, enhancing its relevance. Furthermore, Memories 1, 3, 4, and 5 emphasize their strong work ethic, teamwork, and friendship, which resonates well with the current dialogue context about collaborating and understanding different perspectives. Although there is a slight discrepancy in Memory 2 and Memory 6 regarding the timeline of when the watch was returned (\"a few months ago\" in the dialogue and MEMORY 2 vs. \"a few years ago\" in MEMORY 6), the overall connections and development are clear and contribute to understanding their relationship. Overall, the memories are structured in a coherent manner, providing helpful and relevant background information."
