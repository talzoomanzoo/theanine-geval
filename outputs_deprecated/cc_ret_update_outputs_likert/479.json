Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately. Classmates B: Why is that? Classmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically. Classmates B: That's a good goal to have. Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra? Classmates A: Definitely. I feel like I'm able to break down problems and analyze them more effectively.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness.\n2. Classmate A and Classmate B are classmates.\n3. Classmates B emphasizes the importance of enjoying the journey and effort put in, not just focusing on winning.\n4. Classmates A expresses gratitude for the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n5. Classmates B offers support and suggests taking a step back to find a balance.\n6. Classmates B brings up a past event where Classmates A beat their brother in a race, highlighting their competitive nature.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! It sounds like all your hard work is paying off. Just remember to enjoy the learning process and not put too much pressure on yourself to be perfect. It's important to find a balance and appreciate the journey of growth and improvement.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several helpful pieces of information that can facilitate generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it highlights Classmates B's recognition of Classmates A's determination and competitiveness, which could be echoed in further dialogue as encouragement or advice. The mention of support and friendship (MEMORY sentence 4) is particularly relevant, as it hints at a supportive dynamic that could be leveraged in the conversation, especially since Classmates A is discussing their personal growth. Additionally, MEMORY sentence 5 about balance and enjoyment suggests a potential thread for Classmates B to elaborate on. However, some sentences like the one about the past event with the brother (MEMORY sentence 6) do not directly correlate with the current context of studying algebra. Overall, the MEMORY is structured well enough to support contextual understanding and development, justifying a score close to the top."
