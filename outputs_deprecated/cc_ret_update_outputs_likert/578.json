Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. Neighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off. Neighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks? Neighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else. Neighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location? Neighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home. Neighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become. Neighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice. Neighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along?  Neighbors A: It's finished! Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. It was a lot of work, but worth it in the end. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A had help from friends in building the new house.\n2. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n3. Neighbor A and Neighbor B discuss organizing a community event to make a positive impact and appreciate the beauty of their city.\n4. Neighbors B received a new house built by Neighbors A and is grateful for the extra space.\n5. Neighbor B has not been up to anything interesting lately but is excited about the new house and looking forward to it.\n6. Neighbor A considers Neighbor B a great neighbor and wanted to do something special for them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's amazing to hear! I can't wait to see the finished result. Your hard work definitely paid off.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several sentences that hint at past interactions between Neighbors A and B, which can provide some context for generating future dialogue. For instance, Sentence 4 (\"Neighbors B received a new house built by Neighbors A and is grateful for the extra space\") connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT's mention of the house project. This could help the language model build on the gratitude or community-building aspect of the conversation. Sentence 3 (\"Neighbor A and Neighbor B discuss organizing a community event to make a positive impact\") indicates past collaboration, although it isn't directly related to the current dialogue, it shows a history of cooperative interactions. While other sentences, such as 1 and 6, are related to the characters' relationships and can provide some background information, they are less relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nSome sentences are not as clearly connected or relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, like Sentence 2 and Sentence 5, thus bringing down the MEMORY's overall helpfulness. However, the phrasing of these sentences is clear and provides background context that can be relevant for further interactions, maintaining a moderate helpfulness level."
