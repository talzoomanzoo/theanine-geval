Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn. Teacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation? Student: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle. Teacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time? Student: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then. Teacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going? Student: It's going pretty well. I started with French, but now I'm considering taking up Spanish and German too. I want to become more well-rounded. Teacher: That's a great goal. Have you thought about any specific ways you could use your language skills? Student: I would love to be able to travel more and speak with the locals in their native language. Maybe I could even teach my grandchildren some basic phrases. Teacher: Speaking of your grandchildren, how's your retirement planning going? Student: It's going well. I'm really looking forward to spending more time with them and taking them on fun trips. Teacher: That sounds like a great plan. Speaking of fun, remember when you scared me in the hallway a few days ago? Student: Oh, I'm so sorry about that. I was having a bad day and I shouldn't have taken it out on you. Teacher: No worries. Just remember, it's always better to talk things out calmly instead of yelling.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The teacher advises the student on effective communication and problem-solving, emphasizing the importance of talking calmly and finding solutions together.\n2. The teacher and student have a positive and understanding relationship.\n3. The student mentioned feeling stressed lately, which may have led to the outburst.\n4. The teacher expressed understanding and encouraged the student to seek help when needed.\n5. The student once saved a kid from drowning and had a moment of yelling at the teacher in the past.\n6. The teacher speaks Spanish and French fluently.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You're right, I should have communicated better. I'll definitely keep that in mind moving forward. Thank you for being so understanding, it means a lot to me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information that could assist the language model in generating a relevant next response. Points 1 and 2 highlight the nature of the relationship between the teacher and student, which is positive and understanding, and aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they discuss language learning, future plans, and past interactions. However, points 3 and 5 introduce aspects (such as the student feeling stressed and saving a kid from drowning) that are not directly relevant to the current context and could distract from the main dialogue flow. Nonetheless, they are phrased naturally and can be easily identified as less critical for generating the next response. Point 6 about the teacher speaking Spanish and French fluently complements the discussion about language, which could be relevant if language usage is discussed further. Overall, the MEMORY is moderately helpful, with a mix of relevant and less relevant information phrased clearly."
