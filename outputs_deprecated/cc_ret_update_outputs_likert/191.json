Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, have you checked out my new blog? It's all about promoting under-the-radar artists. Classmates B: I haven't had a chance to yet, but that sounds really cool! What inspired you to start it? Classmates A: Well, I've always had a passion for the arts, but I was too afraid to pursue it. I finally realized that it's what I really love, and I wanted to share that love with others. Classmates B: That's amazing. It takes a lot of courage to pursue your passions like that. Classmates A: Yeah, it was scary at first, but the response has been really positive. I'm so glad I finally decided to take the leap. Classmates B: I'm proud of you. It's always great to see someone following their dreams. Classmates A: Thanks, it's been a journey, but I'm really happy with where I am now. It's crazy to think that years ago, I was so hesitant to even share this part of myself. Classmates B: It just goes to show that it's never too late to start pursuing what you love. Remember when we talked about you living your life on your own terms? You're doing just that.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A ended up taking Classmates B's advice and found success with it.\n2. Both Classmates A and B value the importance of trying new things and taking risks for personal development.\n3. Classmates B expresses a desire to see Classmates A happy and successful in life.\n4. Classmate B emphasizes the importance of positively impacting others while living a fulfilling life.\n5. Classmates B gave advice to Classmates A in the past that paid off.\n6. Classmates A was initially hesitant about following Classmates B's advice.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY offers pertinent information that enhances the understanding of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It details past interactions between Classmate A and Classmate B, highlighting the advice and support Classmate B provided, which aligns with the encouragement and recognition seen in the dialogue. The sentences are structured naturally and reflect a development in their interaction, revealing how Classmate A overcame hesitancy and succeeded. The clarity of these interactions provides contextual cues that a language model can leverage for generating a coherent next response. However, there could be more specific mention of the blog, which is a central element of the current conversation. Adding further context related to the blog could achieve a perfect score."
