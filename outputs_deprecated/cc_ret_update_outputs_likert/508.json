Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria. Co-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking? Co-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you? Co-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you. Co-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago? Co-workers B: Yeah, I remember that conversation. What about it? Co-workers A: Well, I wanted to share some good news with you. I've been recently promoted to the night shift and have been doing a great job. I think I've come a long way since those days. Co-workers B: That's awesome, congratulations! I'm proud of you and all the hard work you've put in. You've definitely grown and matured in the workplace. Co-workers A: Thank you, I appreciate that. But I have to admit, I'm still a bit nervous about being wrong. Remember when we talked about my constantly questioning myself and second-guessing my decisions? Co-workers B: Yeah, I remember that. Is there anything specific that's been bothering you? Co-workers A: Not really, it's just a general feeling of uncertainty at times. But hey, speaking of uncertainty, do you remember when we talked about my love for singing a while ago? Co-workers B: Yes, I do. How's that been going for you? Co-workers A: It's actually been going really well. I recently auditioned for a major singing competition and was chosen as a finalist.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n2. Co-worker A has been working hard on their singing skills and has a passion for music.\n3. Co-worker A expresses nervousness and self-doubt despite their achievements.\n4. Co-worker A appreciates Co-worker B's support and plans to perform in the final round of the competition.\n5. Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A.\n6. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A that making mistakes is okay as long as they learn from them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

Remember, even if you feel uncertain or make mistakes along the way, it's all part of the learning process. Just keep pushing yourself, and I have no doubt you'll shine on that stage.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for understanding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as it captures key elements of the conversation between Co-workers A and B. It highlights Co-worker A's journey, including their previous issues with self-doubt and the recent positive developments in their professional and personal life, such as the promotion and the singing competition. Additionally, it notes the supportive nature of Co-worker B, which is crucial for generating an appropriate response.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY could be more helpful by including more specific references to Co-worker A's promotion and its relation to their sense of accomplishment, as well as detailing their preparation for the singing competition and Co-worker B's exact contributions to this support. This would create a clearer connection to the dialogue's development, enhancing its helpfulness for generating a contextual response."
