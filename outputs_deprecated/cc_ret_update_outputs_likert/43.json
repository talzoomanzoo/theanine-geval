    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away. Co-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that. Co-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way. Co-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's positivity and friendship.\n3. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\n4. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n5. Co-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\n6. Co-worker A intervened to help two women who were fighting, showing bravery and a desire to make a positive impact.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does contain some elements that could potentially be relevant to understanding the personalities and history of Co-worker A and Co-worker B, which can aid in generating a response. For example, Co-worker B's supportive nature and appreciation of Co-worker A's friendship might contextualize B's reaction in promoting respectful and loving behavior in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the specific memories presented are not directly related to the current conversation. The past interactions described do not directly contribute to understanding Co-worker A's extreme reaction or the moral disagreement between the two, which is central to the dialogue. Additionally, some sentences, like the one about Co-worker A being alive and needing to adjust to a new way of life, do not clearly connect to the dialogue scenario and might even confuse the context. Thus, while the MEMORY is organized and provides some character insights, it lacks direct relevance and clarity in relation to the specific dialogue context."
