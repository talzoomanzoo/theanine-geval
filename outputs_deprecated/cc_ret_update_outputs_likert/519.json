Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together. Neighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.\n2. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have a close friendship and have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n3. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n4. Neighbor A and Neighbor B are neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood.\n5. Neighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there.\n6. Neighbor A's old apartment building was not the best place to live in.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically the close friendship between Neighbor A and Neighbor B (point 2) and the support Neighbor B is offering (point 3). These elements suggest that Neighbor B would likely be sympathetic and supportive in the conversation, aligning with their prompt response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, many of the other memories, such as the information about the grandmother's loss (point 1), the catching up outside (point 4), and the recent move to a new neighborhood (points 5 and 6), do not directly relate to the immediate context, which is about Neighbor A's breakup. Additionally, these independent memories do not clearly establish a connection or causality relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it slightly harder for the language model to use them effectively. Therefore, while the MEMORY captures some relevant aspects of the relationship between the two characters, it lacks cohesion and direct relevance to the present situation, resulting in a middle-ground score of 3."
