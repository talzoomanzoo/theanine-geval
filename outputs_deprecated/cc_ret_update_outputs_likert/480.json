Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately. Classmates B: Why is that? Classmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically. Classmates B: That's a good goal to have. Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra? Classmates A: Definitely. I feel like I'm able to break down problems and analyze them more effectively. Classmates B: It's always rewarding when hard work pays off.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness.\n2. Classmates B emphasizes the importance of enjoying the journey and effort put in, not just focusing on winning.\n3. Classmates A expresses gratitude for the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n4. Classmate A and Classmate B are classmates.\n5. Classmates B offers support and suggests taking a step back to find a balance.\n6. Classmates B brings up a past event where Classmates A beat their brother in a race, highlighting their competitive nature.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, it really is. It's like that feeling I had when I beat your brother in that race. Remember how competitive I can be?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains several sentences that provide contextual cues about the relationship and past interactions between Classmates A and B. For example, sentences like “Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination” and “Classmates B brings up a past event where Classmates A beat their brother in a race, highlighting their competitive nature” show elements of their interaction and discussions about competitiveness and determination. Additionally, Classmates B’s emphasis on enjoying the journey and balance in sentence 2 can be linked to the current focus on studying and achieving goals. However, the memory isn't directly related to the algebra conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which makes its helpfulness moderate rather than high. Some sentences, such as \"Classmates A expresses gratitude for the support and friendship of Classmates B,\" provide relevant background context, but it's not essential for the next dialogue response and doesn't show a clear development or connection to the current topic of algebra. Thus, while the MEMORY offers some supportive past interaction details, it lacks stronger connections to the immediate context, warranting a score of 3."
