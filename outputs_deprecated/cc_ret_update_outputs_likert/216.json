Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax. Neighbors B: What kind of breathing exercise? Neighbors A: It's just a simple one, where you inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, and then exhale for eight seconds. I've been doing it every day for the past week and it's made such a difference. Neighbors B: That's really interesting. I've heard that breathing exercises can be really helpful for reducing stress and anxiety. Neighbors A: Yes, it definitely has helped me with that. Plus, it's something that I can easily do anywhere, whether I'm at home or out running errands. Neighbors B: That's great. It's always good to have a simple tool like that to help manage stress.  Neighbors A: Speaking of managing stress, remember a few years ago when I pushed your shoulder because I wanted you to accept me? Neighbors B: Oh yeah, I do remember that. That was a stressful time for both of us.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor B reassures Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasizes their current friendship.\n2. Neighbors A is willing to take things slow in their relationship with Neighbors B.\n3. Neighbor A is embarrassed about a past incident where they pushed Neighbor B's shoulder to gain acceptance.\n4. Neighbors B values their friendship with Neighbors A.\n5. Neighbors A has developed romantic feelings for Neighbors B.\n6. Neighbor A and Neighbor B found a park together a couple of years ago and enjoyed playing frisbee and having a picnic.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm really glad we were able to move past that moment and grow closer as friends. Our friendship means a lot to me, and I appreciate your understanding and patience.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several key points that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and offers a deeper understanding of the relationship between Neighbors A and Neighbors B. For instance, Sentence 3 mentions the past incident where Neighbor A pushed Neighbor B's shoulder, which is directly referenced in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This shows that MEMORY contains pertinent information that can be useful for generating an appropriate response. Additionally, Sentences 1 and 4 emphasize the strength and reassurance in their friendship, which adds context to the ongoing discussion about stress and relationships. However, while Sentences 2 and 5 offer insight into the dynamic between the neighbors, they are less directly connected to the current context of stress management and breathing exercises. Overall, MEMORY is quite helpful in providing context and background information, but it could be improved by having more direct connections to the current stress-reducing theme discussed in DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
