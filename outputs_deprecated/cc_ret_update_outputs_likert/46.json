Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away. Co-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that. Co-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way. Co-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you. Co-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it. Co-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on. Co-workers A: I know you're right, Co-workers B. I just don't know how to get over this feeling.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n3. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's positivity and friendship.\n4. Co-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\n5. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\n6. Co-worker A intervened to help two women who were fighting, showing bravery and a desire to make a positive impact.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I understand that it's hard, Co-workers A. It's important to take some time to reflect on your feelings and find healthier ways to cope. I'm here for you, and we can work through this together. Let's focus on making positive choices and helping others like you did when you intervened to stop that fight.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information regarding the dialogue between Co-worker A and Co-worker B about borrowing a pencil, which is referred to in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The mention of Co-worker A feeling guilty about borrowing a pencil without asking provides a parallel to A's justification for having feelings for the bride. This somewhat helps in understanding Co-worker A's mindframe. However, the rest of the MEMORY (points 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) do not directly relate to the context of the conversation about kidnapping or provide useful insights about the current dialogue. Hence, while the MEMORY includes a few helpful elements, it lacks a coherent development or connection to the main theme of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, limiting its overall helpfulness."
