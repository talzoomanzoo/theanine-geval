Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n2. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n3. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n4. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n5. Neighbors A mentioned mowing the lawn with an old push mower, indicating they are responsible for the yard work.\n6. Neighbor A's mom scolds them for ripping off the tag from their new shirt.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some elements relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the interaction between Neighbors A and B and past shared experiences. For example, sentence 3 about reminiscing past events suggests familiarity and established rapport, which adds depth to the current playful interaction. Sentence 4 regarding conversations about temperature could help in setting the general atmosphere of camaraderie. Sentence 1 slightly relates to the context, as it discusses actions and considerations these neighbors have for each other. However, not all sentences are directly relevant or helpful for generating the next response. Sentence 6 about Neighbor Aâ€™s mom, for instance, does not contribute to the context and does not help understand the dynamics between the neighbors. Overall, the MEMORY offers some useful cues but lacks strong connectivity to the current situation, impacting its overall helpfulness."
