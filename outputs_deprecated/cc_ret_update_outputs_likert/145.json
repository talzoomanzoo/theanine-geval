Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly. Neighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit? Neighbors A: It was Chicago. I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations. Neighbors B: I bet it was a nice change of scenery from our neighborhood. Neighbors A: Definitely. But you know, it's interesting how much our neighborhood has grown on me over the years. I remember when I first moved here, I was so unsure about it. Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember. But you stayed because you wanted to be here. Neighbors A: That's right. And since then, I've made so many great memories here. It's become my home. Neighbors B: And you're still spending time with God every day, right? Neighbors A: Yes, I am. It brings me so much peace and happiness. Neighbors B: That's really admirable. And speaking of power, I remember you telling me about that time when you could make me do anything you wanted.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A enjoys living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbors B has been living in the neighborhood for some time and is supportive of Neighbors A.\n3. Neighbors A is excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends.\n4. Neighbors A finds spending time with God brings them peace and happiness.\n5. Neighbors A values the relationship with Neighbors B and considers them like family.\n6. Neighbors B acknowledges Neighbors A's friendly and outgoing nature.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Oh, that was just a silly joke! I would never use any sort of power over you. Our friendship means more to me than anything like that. I'm just glad we have each other in this wonderful neighborhood.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures the essence of Neighbors A's feelings towards the neighborhood, their relationship with Neighbors B, and their practice of spending time with God. These are relevant to the dialogue context as they reflect the developmental cues and connections between the characters. However, the structure of the memory is somewhat fragmented and does not entirely flow as a cohesive narrative. Some information, like Neighbors A's excitement to explore and make new friends, doesn't strongly connect with the current dialogue's focus on their established feelings and past experiences with the neighborhood and God. While MEMORY contains relevant points, it's not optimally structured to provide a seamless narrative that a language model could easily use to generate a follow-up response."
