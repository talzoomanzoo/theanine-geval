    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly. Neighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit? Neighbors A: It was Chicago. I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A is excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends.\n2. Neighbors A enjoys living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B.\n3. Neighbors A appreciates having friendly faces around and hopes to make new friends soon.\n4. Neighbors A just moved to a new neighborhood and is getting to know the area.\n5. Neighbors B acknowledges Neighbors A's friendly and outgoing nature.\n6. Neighbors B has been living in the neighborhood for some time and is supportive of Neighbors A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some background information about Neighbors A and B, such as Neighbors A recently moving to the neighborhood and being friendly and outgoing, as well as Neighbors B being supportive. However, these details are not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on Neighbors A's recent visit to Chicago. The MEMORY does not contribute to the development of this specific conversation or provide cues that would aid in generating a follow-up response about the city visit. Although the information in MEMORY is structured and provides a general idea of Neighbors A and B's relationship, it lacks direct relevancy and connection to the immediate context."
