Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me. Co-workers B: That's amazing to hear. Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A is grateful for life experiences and is open to new possibilities in the future.\n2. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.\n3. Co-worker B emphasized the importance of learning from mistakes and working together as a team.\n4. Co-worker A has grown as a person and as an artist, learning about empathy and compassion.\n5. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to try relaxation techniques or find a hobby to de-stress and overcome fears.\n6. Co-worker A and Co-worker B are excited about working on future projects together and even starting their own production company someday.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided contains information about Co-worker A and Co-worker B's relationship and interactions; however, it only indirectly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context is about the appreciation of a supportive boss, but the MEMORY focuses on the relationship between the two co-workers, their dynamics, and future aspirations. Some sentences (like 1, 2, and 6) establish a positive collaboration and personal growth that are somewhat relevant to the supportive environment theme, but other sentences (like 3, 4, and 5) lack direct connection to the appreciation of a supportive boss. Overall, while the MEMORY provides some valuable context, it isn't explicitly tied to the supportiveness of their boss mentioned in the dialogue. The sentences are structured in a way that suggests past interaction context, but they don't directly contribute to continuing the specific current conversation about having a supportive boss."
