Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I just finished my computer course, and I learned so much about using computers effectively. Classmates B: That's great! What did you learn specifically? Classmates A: Oh, a lot of things. I learned how to use different programs and software for different tasks, and how to choose the right one depending on what I need to do. Classmates B: Do you have any software recommendations for me? I always struggle with choosing the right program.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and Classmates B are friends who help each other with schoolwork.\n2. Classmates B and Classmates A used to dance a lot in middle school.\n3. Classmate B is a supportive friend who listens and offers to help.\n4. Classmates B supported Classmates A through a tough time by listening to them.\n5. Classmates A has matured since then and learned from past mistakes.\n6. Classmate A appreciates having friends who are there for them during difficult times.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad you're interested in learning more about computer programs! Based on what I've learned, I recommend trying out Microsoft Office for general tasks like word processing and presentations. It's user-friendly and versatile, which might make it easier for you to navigate through different programs.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, memories 1 and 3 indicate a supportive relationship between Classmates A and B, which is relevant to their interaction about learning and offering recommendations. These memories show that Classmate B is likely to be an attentive listener and genuinely interested in Classmate A's recommendations, which can inform a positive and engaging response.\n\nHowever, other memories, such as 2, 4, 5, and 6, while providing background about their friendship and support during tough times, are less directly related to the specific context of discussing computer courses and software. These memories offer a broader context of their relationship but aren't as connected to the current topic of conversation about computer programs.\n\nThus, the memory provides some useful context regarding their supportive friendship, but not strongly aligned with the specific conversation about computer software recommendations."
