Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins. Neighbors B: Oh, okay. I didn't realize there was any confusion about that. Neighbors A: Well, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page. I don't want any misunderstandings in the future. Neighbors B: I understand. Is there anything else we should do to make sure we're clear about this? Neighbors A: I don't think so, but if you have any other suggestions, I'm open to hearing them.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B offers to be more supportive and check in on Neighbors A more often.\n2. Both neighbors emphasize the importance of taking care of each other as neighbors.\n3. Neighbors A offers to help Neighbors B with getting into a workout routine.\n4. Neighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B.\n5. Neighbor A and Neighbor B went to a concert together in the past and had a great time.\n6. Neighbors A is feeling overwhelmed and stressed, mentioning having a lot on their plate.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains information about past interactions between Neighbors A and B, such as offering support, shared interests, and activities. However, it doesn't directly relate to the specific issue of property boundary lines discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Most of the sentences in MEMORY don't provide contextually relevant information that would help a language model generate a suitable continuation of the current conversation focused on clarification and boundary setting. The connections presented in the MEMORY do not clearly relate to the current situation, which means they would not significantly aid in forming an appropriate response."
