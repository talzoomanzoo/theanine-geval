Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today? Co-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there? Co-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done. Co-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded. Co-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out. Co-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends? Co-workers A: Ugh, don't remind me. That was such a disaster. Co-workers B: It was definitely not one of your finest moments. But it's good to see that you're being responsible now and taking care of things like sending packages. Co-workers A: Thanks. I'm trying to be more responsible and reliable these days. Co-workers B: That's great to hear. It reminds me of the time when you were a great leader in your country. You were strong, determined, and made a positive impact. Co-workers A: Wow, that was a long time ago. But I appreciate the compliment. It's nice to be reminded of my successes.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both co-workers show a supportive and caring attitude towards each other.\n2. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to give people a chance.\n3. Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides.\n4. Co-worker A believes their success as a leader was due to determination and strength of character.\n5. Co-worker A has been successful in not being late to work for weeks.\n6. Co-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "As of my last training cut-off date in October 2023, I can evaluate the 'MEMORY' based on the given 'DIALOGUE CONTEXT' and the help it provides to a language model in generating a proper next response, according to the provided criterion.\n\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\nHelpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does contain some helpful information that can assist a language model in generating a proper response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences in the MEMORY convey relationships and personalities, such as Co-worker A's efforts to be more responsible and Co-worker B's supportive role. These cues help establish the ongoing dynamics between the two speakers.\n\nHowever, much of the MEMORY contains details that are not directly relevant to the current dialogue. For instance, points about Co-worker B encouraging Co-worker A to give people a chance, and the fact about Co-worker A not being late to work for weeks, seem less connected to the specific exchanges in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Furthermore, while the statements are relevant to the general past interactions, they could be structured in a way that is more directly tied to the current topic of conversation.\n\nAdditionally, any connections or causality between statements are somewhat implied rather than explicitly demonstrated. As such, they might not provide enough immediate material directly linked to generating a natural continuation in this specific dialogue. Therefore, the overall score falls to an average rating."
