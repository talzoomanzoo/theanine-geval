    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: It's great to have friends who can help each other out, isn't it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the suggestion.\n2. Neighbors A bought a necklace from Neighbors B's shop and loves it.\n3. Neighbors B offered to help Neighbors A with the apology process.\n4. Neighbors A was looking for a new necklace and stumbled upon Neighbors B's shop.\n5. Neighbors A struggled with apologizing and admitting when they are wrong.\n6. Both neighbors express the difficulty of not being able to adopt all the animals they see but appreciate those who do adopt and give them loving homes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, it really is. It's important to have a support system you can rely on.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several pieces of information that are relevant and helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it mentions that Neighbors A thanked Neighbors B for a suggestion, which reflects their supportive relationship, aligning with the idea of friends helping each other out. Additionally, Neighbors B's offer to help with an apology process indicates a history of mutual aid, further reinforcing their supportive bond. The mention of the necklace purchase adds context about their interactions and underlying friendship. The MEMORY is cohesively structured, with natural connections between sentences, allowing for easy interpretation of their past interactions. However, the information about the difficulty of not being able to adopt animals, although well-phrased, seems slightly less relevant to the specific conversation context, which slightly detracts from a perfect score of 5."
