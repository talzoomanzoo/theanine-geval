    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing! Neighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go? Neighbors A: I visited Brazil and Peru. The culture and food were incredible. Neighbors B: That sounds awesome. I've always wanted to go to Peru to see Machu Picchu. Neighbors A: Yes, Machu Picchu is amazing. The view from the top is breathtaking. Neighbors B: Have you thought about where you want to go next? Neighbors A: Yeah, I'm thinking about visiting Australia and Antarctica next. I want to see the Great Barrier Reef and the penguins.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's organization skills and wishes to improve their own organization.\n2. Neighbors A and B believe in doing nice things for others to bring the community together.\n3. Both Neighbors A and B believe in the importance of learning and self-improvement.\n4. Neighbor A is feeling frustrated and is considering going to a bar to find someone for a casual encounter.\n5. Neighbors A and B both took a cooking class together last year.\n6. Neighbor B suggests finding other ways to relieve frustration and looking out for Neighbor A's well-being.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Those sound like amazing destinations! Just make sure to plan some time for self-reflection and relaxation while you're there. It's important to take care of yourself, especially after feeling frustrated.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains a set of statements that offer some insights into the personalities and relationship dynamics of Neighbors A and B, such as their shared values and interests. However, these sentences do not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which primarily focuses on Neighbor A's recent travel experiences and future travel plans. Only the mention of the shared cooking class somewhat aligns with the cultural and food topic discussed in the context, but it's not closely linked or causally developed within the MEMORY. Additionally, the memory lacks natural phrasing and connection between sentences, making it harder for a language model to utilize efficiently when generating a response. Therefore, while some degree of similarity exists with their shared values, the MEMORY does not offer substantial help or relevant information directly tied to the travel topic in the dialogue."
