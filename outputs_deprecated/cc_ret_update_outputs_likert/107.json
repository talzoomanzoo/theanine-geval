    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become? Neighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out? Neighbors A: Yes, I go to the gym every day and lift weights. It's been really helping me build muscle. Neighbors B: That's great to hear! It reminds me of the time when you apologized to me for the way you treated me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B appreciates Neighbors A's handy skills.\n2. Neighbors A apologized to Neighbors B for their behavior and admitted to being wrong.\n3. Neighbor A noticed some wood near their backyard and asked Neighbor B if they had seen it too.\n4. Neighbors A is good at fixing things, particularly electronics.\n5. Neighbors A and B are observing wood that appears to be freshly cut from a tree.\n6. Neighbors A and B appreciate the resourcefulness of using fallen trees for firewood or other purposes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I remember that well. I'm grateful for your understanding and forgiveness. It's important to admit when we're wrong and make amends. By the way, have you seen that fallen tree in my backyard? I think we could use it for firewood or maybe even some DIY projects.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 2 directly references the apology Neighbors A made to Neighbors B, which is mentioned in the context. This establishes a connection between the two speakers' past interactions and could be useful for generating a response about their improved relationship. However, the other sentences in MEMORY, while naturally structured, do not directly relate to the current dialogue about Neighbor A's strength or their gym routine. These sentences about handy skills, wood observations, and resourcefulness with wood are not helpful in generating the next response for the current conversation. Thus, the MEMORY provides limited helpful information, but the development and structure of interactions are sufficiently clear within the given sentences."
