    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, have you ever tried to imagine what it would be like to think like someone else? Mentor: Yes, I have. It's a great way to better understand and empathize with others. Mentee: That's exactly what I thought. I've been trying to imagine what personY is thinking lately. It's been helping me to understand their perspective a bit better. Mentor: That's a great approach. Putting ourselves in someone else's shoes can help us see things from a different angle and see where they're coming from. Mentee: Exactly. And it also helps me to be more compassionate towards them. I think it's important for us to be more understanding and supportive of each other, especially in difficult times. Mentor: I agree completely. It's important to be kind and compassionate towards others, especially when they may be going through something challenging. Mentee: And I think it's also important to remember that we all have different perspectives and experiences that shape our thoughts and actions. Mentor: Absolutely. Keeping an open mind and being willing to listen to others can help us to learn from them and grow as individuals. Mentee: That's so true. And it's a great way to build stronger relationships with others. So, Mentor, have you ever tried to imagine what it's like to be in a different culture or country? Mentor: Yes, as a matter of fact, I have. I think it's important to learn about other cultures and broaden our perspectives. Mentee: That's really interesting. Where are you from, Mentor?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentee wants to make a positive impact in people's lives and is grateful for Mentor's support.\n2. Mentor became a mentor to help others going through similar situations.\n3. Mentor encourages Mentee to approach teaching religion with an open mind and heart.\n4. Mentee agrees to try the advice and express gratitude towards Mentor.\n5. Mentee is taking the idea of teaching religion seriously and wants to make a positive impact on people's lives.\n6. Mentee has been thinking about helping others who may be in abusive cults.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm originally from the Midwest, but I've had the opportunity to travel and work in different countries, which has really opened my eyes to different ways of life and thinking. It's been a rewarding experience to learn from different cultures and appreciate the diversity in our world. How about you, Mentee? Have you had any experiences with different cultures that have impacted your perspective?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided contains information and reflections from past interactions between the Mentor and Mentee. However, the entries seem to focus more on the Mentee's aspirations and experiences with religion, teaching, and helping others, which isn't directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The present conversation revolves around understanding different perspectives and cultures, which has only a tenuous connection to the MEMORY. While it's helpful to know the broader motivations and intentions of the Mentee in terms of wanting to make a positive impact, most specific elements (e.g., teaching religion, abusive cults) are not clearly tied to the current dialogue about empathy and cultural understanding. The memory entries should have been more aligned or complementary to the ongoing theme of the dialogue to be rated higher."
