Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today? Co-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there? Co-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides.\n2. Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions.\n3. Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits.\n4. Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides.\n5. Co-worker A has been successful in not being late to work for weeks.\n6. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to give people a chance.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! It's good to see you taking care of your errands efficiently. How did it feel to get everything sorted out without any delays?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not offer any direct information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT in terms of the recent interaction at the post office. Most of the MEMORY focuses on Co-worker A's personal habits, struggles, and improvements, such as dealing with late nights out and avoiding expensive Uber rides. Although it offers some insight into the relationship dynamics between the co-workers, it doesn't provide any connection or causality relevant to the current situation described in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the post office trip and postage hassles. Because of this lack of direct relevance and natural connection to the given dialogue, the MEMORY scores low on helpfulness for generating the next response."
