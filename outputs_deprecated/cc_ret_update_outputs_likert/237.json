Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that. Neighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset? Neighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore. Neighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\n2. Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received.\n3. Neighbors A wants to rearrange their living room and Neighbors B has experience with rearranging furniture.\n4. Neighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship as neighbors.\n5. Neighbors A is detail-oriented and strives for perfection.\n6. Neighbors B values reciprocity and acknowledges the mutual help between them as neighbors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I did try to address the issue with my boss, but it didn't go as smoothly as I hoped. I appreciate your understanding and for being there to listen.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful context for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly in describing the supportive and understanding relationship between Neighbors A and B, as seen in sentences 1 and 4. This matches the empathy shown in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Neighbors B is understanding towards Neighbors A's frustration. Sentence 6 also contributes to indicating the mutual supportive nature of their relationship, which is slightly relevant to the context as well. However, the other sentences related to rearranging furniture (sentence 3) and Neighbors A's detail-orientation or perfectionism (sentence 5) do not directly contribute to understanding the current conversation on workplace frustrations. Therefore, while some helpful connections are present, the MEMORY isn't entirely comprehensive or fully relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
