Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing! Neighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and B both took a cooking class together last year.\n2. Neighbors A and B believe in doing nice things for others to bring the community together.\n3. Neighbors A saw George at the store and exchanged waves.\n4. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's organization skills and wishes to improve their own organization.\n5. Both Neighbors A and B believe in the importance of learning and self-improvement.\n6. Neighbor A is feeling frustrated and is considering going to a bar to find someone for a casual encounter.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains various pieces of information about the neighbors, but doesn't provide much helpful context for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about a recent trip to South America. \n\n1. Memory point 1 about taking a cooking class together is somewhat related as it implies a level of familiarity and shared interests, but it doesn't directly connect to the trip.\n2. Memory point 2 about their shared belief in doing nice things is unrelated to the dialogue context.\n3. Memory point 3 about Neighbors A seeing George at the store is irrelevant to the current conversation about the South America trip.\n4. Memory point 4 regarding organization skills doesnâ€™t relate to the trip context.\n5. Memory point 5 on the importance of learning and self-improvement is tangentially related and could be somewhat relevant if the conversation shifts towards learning from travel experiences.\n6. Memory point 6 about Neighbor A's frustration and desire for a casual encounter is entirely irrelevant to the context and shouldn't impact the response.\n\nOverall, the memory does not provide clear or helpful information directly relevant to the conversation about travel, hence a score of 2."
