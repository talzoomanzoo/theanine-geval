Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message. Co-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident. Co-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows. Co-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive. Co-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument.\n2. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs.\n3. Co-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\n4. Co-worker A believes their evidence is more compelling than the opposing side's evidence.\n5. Co-worker A has experience dealing with challenging clients and emphasizes the importance of communication and setting expectations.\n6. Co-worker A agrees to be more conscious of how they come across to others in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Your ability to combine statistics with personal anecdotes really makes your evidence stand out. It's not just about presenting data; it's about connecting with people on a deeper level, and you excel at that.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does contain some relevant information that could assist a language model in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is somewhat lacking in natural connection and development of ideas. Sentences 1, 3, and 4 are related to the context of Co-worker A presenting evidence and having confidence in their argument, which aligns with the discussion about public speaking and debating skills. However, the rest of the sentences, such as dealing with challenging clients (Sentence 5) and being conscious of one's demeanor (Sentence 6), while potentially relevant to Co-worker A's overall character or work environment, do not have a clear connection to the immediate context of the conversation about public speaking and argumentation. Sentence 2 offers a compliment but does not tie strongly to the dialogue context. These points, therefore, lower the memory's usefulness somewhat, but it still maintains a moderate level of helpfulness."
