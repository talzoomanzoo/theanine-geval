Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel really fulfilled as a leader and guide. Helping others gives me a sense of purpose. Co-workers B: I can see that. You always seem to know just what to do to make people feel better. Co-workers A: Yeah, I've had a lot of practice over the years. It's just something that comes naturally to me. Co-workers B: Do you remember that time when you were led to a safe place by the commander? You must have felt pretty grateful for his guidance then. Co-workers A: Absolutely. It was a really tough time and I was so relieved to have someone show me the way. I try to pay it forward by being that kind of leader for others.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A had a positive experience with a commander who helped them feel safe.\n2. Co-worker B values finding fulfillment in work, pursuing hobbies, making a difference in the world, and building relationships with others.\n3. Co-worker B emphasizes the importance of acknowledging privileges and using them to make the world a better place.\n4. Co-worker A believes that everyone has the ability to create opportunities and make their own luck through hard work and seizing opportunities.\n5. Co-worker A is self-aware about being stubborn and needing to learn to compromise.\n6. Co-worker A values making money and is interested in opportunities to do so.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information for the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks comprehensive connection and clarity. Sentence 1 is directly related to the dialogue context as it reflects the positive experience Co-worker A had with the commander, which aligns with the conversation about leadership and guidance. However, the other sentences (2 to 6) seem disjointed and don't clearly relate to the specific context or demonstrate a clear connection or development of events. They provide more general information about Co-workers A and B, like their values and beliefs, which could be useful in broader contexts but are not directly beneficial for generating a response in this specific dialogue context. This lacks integration or highlights of causality between their previous interactions, hence achieving a mid-level score."
