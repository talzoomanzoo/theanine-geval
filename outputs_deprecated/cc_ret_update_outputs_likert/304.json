Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins. Neighbors B: Oh, okay. I didn't realize there was any confusion about that. Neighbors A: Well, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page. I don't want any misunderstandings in the future. Neighbors B: I understand. Is there anything else we should do to make sure we're clear about this? Neighbors A: I don't think so, but if you have any other suggestions, I'm open to hearing them. Neighbors B: No, I think the line is a good idea. It's clear and simple. Neighbors A: Great. Hey, speaking of lines and boundaries, remember when we talked about my promotion at work? I had to set some clear boundaries with my team about what I expected from them. Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember. How did that go? Neighbors A: It was tough at first, but eventually, everyone respected the boundaries I set and our team was more productive because of it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B offers to be more supportive and check in on Neighbors A more often.\n2. Neighbors B was read to from a book about personal development by Neighbors A, which had a positive impact on Neighbors A's career growth.\n3. Neighbors A believes in setting goals, developing a positive attitude, and taking action for personal development and career advancement.\n4. Both neighbors emphasize the importance of taking care of each other as neighbors.\n5. Neighbor A and Neighbor B went to a concert together in the past and had a great time.\n6. Neighbors A offers to help Neighbors B with getting into a workout routine.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! Setting boundaries can be challenging, but it's important for maintaining a positive work environment. I'm glad it worked out well for you and your team.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains a few sentences that might provide slight background context about the relationship or interactions of the neighbors, such as Neighbors B offering support and the emphasis on helping each other as neighbors. However, most of the entries do not directly relate to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on property boundaries and setting expectations and boundaries at work. Many of the sentences in MEMORY do not provide useful information or development that would help in generating the next dialogue, and some details, like attending a concert together or reading from a personal development book, are not relevant to the current conversation. The connections and causality between the memory items and the context are not apparent, making the MEMORY limited in usefulness for generating an appropriate next response."
