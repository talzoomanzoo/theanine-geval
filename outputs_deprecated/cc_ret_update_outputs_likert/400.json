    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned? Classmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed. Classmates A: Embarrassed? Why?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during the difficult situation.\n2. Classmates A is stranded in space, running out of oxygen and feeling lightheaded.\n3. Classmates A helped Classmates B out of friendship and believes in supporting each other.\n4. Classmates B praised Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n5. Classmates A and B have been on field trips to other planets or moons before, like Mars.\n6. Classmate B praises Classmate A's attention to detail and work ethic as truly impressive.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I was just thinking about that time we were on Mars and I forgot to pack my helmet before going out for a walk. Your quick thinking and attention to detail saved me from a potential disaster.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not offer much relevance or helpful context to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The main topic in the dialogue involves Classmate B feeling embarrassed, but the MEMORY primarily contains memories about space-related events and qualities related to Classmate A's support and work ethic. There are no explicit connections or causal relations shown between these space experiences and the current issue of embarrassment in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Although some sentences in the MEMORY detail positive interactions and commendations between the classmates, these details do not provide insight into Classmate B's current emotional state or why they might feel embarrassed. Therefore, the relevance and helpfulness of the MEMORY to generate a meaningful continuation of the conversation are limited, leading to a low score."
