Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, have you checked out my new blog? It's all about promoting under-the-radar artists. Classmates B: I haven't had a chance to yet, but that sounds really cool! What inspired you to start it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A ended up taking Classmates B's advice and found success with it.\n2. Classmates A was initially hesitant about following Classmates B's advice.\n3. Classmates B gave advice to Classmates A in the past that paid off.\n4. Both Classmates A and B value the importance of trying new things and taking risks for personal development.\n5. Classmates B expresses a desire to see Classmates A happy and successful in life.\n6. Classmates B has been working and traveling since high school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some relevant information that could be beneficial for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 2, and 3 suggest a past interaction where Classmates B gave advice to Classmates A, which could relate to the blog project and contribute to answering \"What inspired you to start it?\" However, there is no direct linkage to the blog in these sentences. Sentence 4 about their shared values could also hint at a context for starting the blog, assuming taking risks is part of that context. Sentences 5 and 6, on the other hand, do not directly relate to the current dialogue context and thus hold less relevance. Overall, while the MEMORY contains some helpful connections, the lack of direct relevance and vagueness in phrasing prevents a higher rating."
