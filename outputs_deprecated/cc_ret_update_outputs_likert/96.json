    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you. Classmates B: Oh really?

Classmates B: I totally agree. You're so creative and outgoing, while I'm more analytical and detail-oriented. Classmates A: It's like we were meant to work together, right?\n\nMEMORY:\n1.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY includes several points about the relationship and interactions between Classmates A and B. However, it lacks a clear connection to the specifics of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around their excitement and plans to start a marketing agency together. Some memory points, such as Classmates B admiring Classmate A's outgoing nature, align with Classmates B's comment in the dialogue about Classmates A being creative and outgoing. However, the majority of the MEMORY involves unrelated activities like karaoke and meeting for coffee, which do not contribute directly to the conversation about their business plans. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it included more relevant details about their professional interests, discussions, or previous collaborations. Thus, it receives a low score for lack of relevance despite some naturally connected phrasing."
