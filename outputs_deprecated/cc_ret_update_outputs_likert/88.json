Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A is social and enjoys meeting new people.\n2. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n3. Classmate A and Classmate B enjoy singing karaoke together and look forward to future outings.\n4. Classmates A is looking forward to meeting up with Classmates B again after getting better sleep.\n5. Classmate B admires Classmate A's outgoing nature and wants to be more like them.\n6. Classmates A and B are open to meeting for coffee again in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful information for a language model to generate a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reveals that Classmate A is social and enjoys meeting new people, which aligns with having exciting plans for the future. Additionally, the memory indicates that Classmate B admires Classmate A's outgoing nature and supports their journey toward a better future, which can inspire a supportive response. The mention of shared activities like karaoke and coffee outings suggest the two have a friendly and positive relationship, which is relevant when responding to exciting plans. Although some details, such as the karaoke or better sleep, are not directly related to the exciting plans, they contribute to a naturally structured understanding of their relationship. Overall, most of the information is useful and well-connected, but it could be strengthened by more direct linkage to the \"exciting plans.\""
