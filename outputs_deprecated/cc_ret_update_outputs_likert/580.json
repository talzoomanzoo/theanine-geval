    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. Neighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off. Neighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks? Neighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else. Neighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location? Neighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home. Neighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become. Neighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice. Neighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along?  Neighbors A: It's finished! Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. It was a lot of work, but worth it in the end.  Neighbors B: That's amazing, thanks for building me such a beautiful house.  Neighbors A: Of course, I'm glad you like it. Remember when we watched the sunset over the London skyline? That was such a beautiful moment.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A had help from friends in building the new house.\n2. Neighbor A and Neighbor B discuss organizing a community event to make a positive impact and appreciate the beauty of their city.\n3. Neighbors B received a new house built by Neighbors A and is grateful for the extra space.\n4. Neighbor A considers Neighbor B a great neighbor and wanted to do something special for them.\n5. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n6. Neighbor B has not been up to anything interesting lately but is excited about the new house and looking forward to it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I remember that day. It was truly special. I can't wait to create more memories in our new home.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains a variety of relevant details that can assist in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, multiple points in the memory pertain to the house that Neighbors A built for Neighbors B, aligning with Neighbors B's gratitude for the new home as mentioned in the dialogue context. Details such as Neighbors A having help from friends (Memory 1) and Neighbor A's intent to do something special for Neighbor B (Memory 4) provide more background and development of their relationship, which is useful for further dialogue creation. Additionally, Memory 2 about organizing a community event could be connected to their shared values of making a positive impact, aligning with their mutual appreciation of a beautiful moment watching the sunset. Most of the memory entries present relevant background in a coherent manner, though some (like using skills for good or evil in Memory 5) might not be directly relevant to the immediate context conversation. Overall, the memory is quite helpful, but could be slightly improved in terms of direct relevance to score a perfect 5."
