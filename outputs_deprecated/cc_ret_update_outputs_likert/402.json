    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned? Classmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed. Classmates A: Embarrassed? Why? Classmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier. Classmates A: Come on, tell me! I won't judge you, I promise.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during the difficult situation.\n2. Classmates A helped Classmates B out of friendship and believes in supporting each other.\n3. Classmates B praised Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n4. Classmates A is stranded in space, running out of oxygen and feeling lightheaded.\n5. Classmate A believes in doing their best at everything to avoid regrets later.\n6. Classmate B praises Classmate A's attention to detail and work ethic as truly impressive.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains sentences that do not relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT in a meaningful way. The context is about an embarrassing incident that happened to Classmate B, while the MEMORY includes unrelated topics such as being in space and providing support or expressing gratitude. There is no clear connection or development related to the dialogue context about the embarrassing incident. The information in the MEMORY does not provide any relevant cues that could help in understanding the current conversation between Classmates A and B. As such, it does not assist in generating a next response in the given dialogue context."
