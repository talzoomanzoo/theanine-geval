    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today. Classmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about? Classmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held. Classmates B: Wow, that does sound interesting. Did you take any notes?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B noticed Classmates A's improvement and acknowledged their hard work.\n2. Classmate B is working on finishing a history project.\n3. Classmates B recalls a funny moment from high school involving Classmates A wearing pajamas to school.\n4. Classmate B is interested in attending a new technology conference next month.\n5. Classmates A's grades are looking good according to their teacher.\n6. Classmates A had a moment of frustration in the past but has learned to channel that energy into studies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I took a bunch of notes. It was fascinating to see how advanced their engineering techniques were back then. Reminded me of that time in high school when I showed up in pajamas by accident!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided includes various pieces of information about Classmates A and B, such as academic performance, past events, and future interests. However, most of the information is not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Classmates A attending a talk on the history of the pyramids. There is no clear connection, development, or causality within the MEMORY concerning the current context of the conversation. While the MEMORY phrases are naturally structured, they do not offer helpful contextual cues or information that would assist in generating the next response in this particular dialogue. Only the fact about Classmates A's dedication and hard work (would indirectly correlate through the act of taking notes) has a slight possibility of being contextually tied to the conversation, but overall, the MEMORY lacks relevance and strong connection to offer significant help."
