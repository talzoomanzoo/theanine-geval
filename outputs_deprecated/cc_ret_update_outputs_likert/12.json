Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends. Mentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n2. The Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process.\n3. The Mentee has been offered a job and has decided to take the job in the city.\n4. Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process.\n5. Mentee agreed to go back to the store to make things right and expressed gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n6. Mentor emphasizes the importance of self-care for dealing with challenges.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You're right, Mentor. I'll try to see this as a chance to build new friendships and connections. Thank you for reminding me of that.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information. For instance, the first sentence could be somewhat relevant as it shows that the mentor has reassured the mentee before, which ties back to the mentor's supportive nature in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The third sentence about the mentee moving to the city relates directly to the mentee's current situation of feeling lonely, which is a result of accepting the new job in the city. However, other sentences in the MEMORY, such as those discussing college applications or returning to a store, appear less relevant to the current context. Although these sentences convey past interactions where the mentor provided guidance, they don't directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT of feeling lonely in a new city. The MEMORY provides some background on previous interactions but could be more specifically tailored to the current context to be more helpful."
