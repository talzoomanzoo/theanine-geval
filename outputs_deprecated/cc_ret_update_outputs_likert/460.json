Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?

Classmates A: Yeah, I guess it does. It’s just that I’ve been hurt before, and I don’t want to lose you as a friend too. Classmates B: I understand your concerns,. but I think we can make this work. We've already built a strong foundation of friendship, which is important for any relationship.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B are close and have a level of trust between them.\n2. Classmate A recalls a moment where they admired Classmate B's courage and strength in sharing a secret, showing their supportive and compassionate nature.\n3. Classmates B feels relieved to have someone to confide in about the secret.\n4. Classmates A offered help and support to Classmates B.\n5.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several helpful pieces of information that could aid in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY highlights elements of trust and support between Classmates A and B (points 1 and 2), which aligns with the feelings and dynamics explored in the context where both are open to exploring a romantic relationship. The recollection of a positive experience (point 5) reinforces the existing connection and comfort level between them. Additionally, both classmates have shared secrets (point 6), indicating a level of intimacy that makes their current conversation more plausible. However, not all points directly relate to the current discussion, such as the specific incident at the coffee shop, which is not immediately relevant but does provide context for their comfort with one another. Overall, the MEMORY is phrased naturally and provides essential insights into their relationship, aiding in the generation of relevant dialogue."
