Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind? Classmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you. Classmates B: Oh, really? Classmates A: Yes, really. I know we've been friends for a while now, but I feel like there may be something more between us. Classmates B: Hmm, I never thought about it that way. But I can’t deny that we have a great connection.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B are close and have a level of trust between them.\n2. Classmates A discovered a secret that Classmates B has been keeping.\n3. Classmates A and B are students in the same class.\n4. Classmates A and B have had a previous positive interaction in a coffee shop where Classmates A rubbed Classmates B's neck, providing relaxation.\n5. Classmates A offered help and support to Classmates B.\n6. Classmate A recalls a moment where they admired Classmate B's courage and strength in sharing a secret, showing their supportive and compassionate nature.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides mostly relevant and helpful information that could assist a language model representing Parent in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Here's how the MEMORY aligns with the criterion and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\n\n1. The first sentence in the MEMORY establishes the level of trust and closeness between Classmates A and B, which directly relates to the conversation's theme of exploring a deeper connection.\n2. Sentence 5, where Classmate A offers help and support, underscores the supportive nature of the relationship, which is pertinent to the emotional tone and development of their conversation.\n3. Sentence 6, highlighting a past moment where Classmate A admired Classmate B's courage and compassion, further enriches the context of their positive dynamic and could guide the model in continuing the supportive tone.\n4. Though Sentence 2 about a secret and Sentence 4 about a coffee shop interaction are not directly connected to the current conversation, they offer a backdrop of meaningful events that frame the relationship positively.\n5. Sentence 3, stating they are classmates, is not highly insightful in terms of emotional context but provides a factual setting.\n\nThe MEMORY provides an overall coherent and supportive history of interactions that can effectively inform continuation of the dialogue, which is why it scores high, though not perfect as some information is less directly related to the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
