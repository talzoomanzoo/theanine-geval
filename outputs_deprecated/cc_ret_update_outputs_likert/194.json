Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager! Co-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role. Co-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader.\n2. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n3. Co-worker B acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress.\n4. Co-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication.\n5. Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n6. Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fantastic news! I have no doubt you'll excel in your new role. Your growth and confidence over the years have prepared you well for this opportunity. Just remember to trust your instincts and keep up the great communication skills you've always emphasized.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences indicate that Co-worker A has been on a journey of growth and is now ready to take on more responsibility, which is relevant to their recent promotion. It highlights Co-worker A's aspirations and confidence, which align with their new role as a product manager. Additionally, the support and acknowledgment from Co-worker B are relevant for generating supportive responses. However, some aspects of the MEMORY, like Co-worker A's fantasies of being a great leader, may not directly contribute to the immediate context of the conversation but are nevertheless naturally phrased. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured and provides useful context for understanding the speakers' past interactions."
