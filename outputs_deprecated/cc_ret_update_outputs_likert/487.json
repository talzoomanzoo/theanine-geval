Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I just finished my computer course, and I learned so much about using computers effectively.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A has matured since then and learned from past mistakes.\n2. Classmates A acknowledges the mistake and plans to learn from it.\n3. Classmates A and Classmates B are friends who help each other with schoolwork.\n4. Classmates B supported Classmates A through a tough time by listening to them.\n5. Classmates B and Classmates A used to dance a lot in middle school.\n6. Classmates A is considering taking a dance class for fun.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's awesome to hear! I remember how much you struggled with technology back in middle school. It's great to see how much you've learned and grown since then. If you ever need help with anything computer-related, you know I'm here to support you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that partially aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but some entries are not directly relevant. The context mentions Classmates A learning from a computer course, which suggests improvement or development, potentially linking to entries 1 and 2 regarding maturity and learning from mistakes. However, there is no clear causality or direct connection between the course itself and these memories. Entry 3 highlights a friendship that could be tangentially helpful in understanding Classmates A's support system, though it doesn't add much to the computer course context. Entry 4 might suggest another form of support from Classmates B, which could potentially relate to the learning environment or past mistakes not specified in DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Entries 5 and 6 about dancing are unrelated to the current topic of computer learning and do not contribute to generating a next response. Overall, while some entries offer contextual cues about Classmates A's development, the MEMORY as a whole lacks strong relevance and connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
