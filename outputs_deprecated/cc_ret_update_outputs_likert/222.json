Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A made a big career change recently and is much happier now.\n2. Neighbors A took the leap to make a change and is glad they did.\n3. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's decision and admires the courage it took.\n4. Neighbors A's husband thinks they are crazy for believing they saw a UFO.\n5. Neighbors A and B had a conversation a couple of years ago about needing a change.\n6. Neighbors A plans to start looking for new opportunities soon and needs to update their resume and start networking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some background on Neighbors A and B's past interactions, particularly regarding Neighbors A's recent career change, their happiness with this change, and Neighbors B's support. However, the MEMORY lacks specific information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about Neighbors A becoming a millionaire. There is some natural structuring in the sentences, but they do not directly connect to or explain how Neighbors A became a millionaire. Sentences 5 and 6, for instance, mention a need for change and future plans, but they do not provide historical context that clarifies the present situation mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the MEMORY gives a vague idea of Neighbors A's background, it does not sufficiently aid a language model in generating a response focused on Neighbors A's newfound wealth."
