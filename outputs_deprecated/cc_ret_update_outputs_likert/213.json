    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax. Neighbors B: What kind of breathing exercise? Neighbors A: It's just a simple one, where you inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, and then exhale for eight seconds. I've been doing it every day for the past week and it's made such a difference. Neighbors B: That's really interesting. I've heard that breathing exercises can be really helpful for reducing stress and anxiety. Neighbors A: Yes, it definitely has helped me with that. Plus, it's something that I can easily do anywhere, whether I'm at home or out running errands.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A is willing to take things slow in their relationship with Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbor B reassures Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasizes their current friendship.\n3. Neighbors B values their friendship with Neighbors A.\n4. Neighbors A has developed romantic feelings for Neighbors B.\n5. Neighbor A and Neighbor B found a park together a couple of years ago and enjoyed playing frisbee and having a picnic.\n6. Both neighbors enjoy discovering new things in their neighborhood and spending time with their children.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains information about the relationship and shared experiences between Neighbors A and B, such as romantic feelings, friendship, and past activities like picnics and playing frisbee. However, these details are not directly relevant or helpful for generating a response based on the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on breathing exercises and stress reduction techniques. While MEMORY includes naturally structured sentences that reflect the interactions between the two neighbors, it lacks any direct connection or causality with the topic of the dialogue. Hence it receives a score of 2 for providing limited helpful information related to the context."
