Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I really enjoy being a carpenter. It's a very fulfilling job. Classmates B: That's great to hear! How did you get into carpentry? Classmates A: My dad was a carpenter, so I grew up around it. I started by helping him out when I was young, and then I began to really enjoy it myself. Classmates B: That's awesome that you were able to learn from your dad and turn it into a career. Have you done any big projects lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A is attending a seminar on starting a business and is excited about applying that knowledge to future plans.\n2. Classmates B is supportive and encourages Classmates A in their business venture.\n3. Classmate B offers to support and potentially collaborate with Classmate A in the future.\n4. Classmates A has had a business idea for a while and is now taking steps to make it a reality.\n5. Classmates A is willing to work hard and learn the necessary strategies for business success.\n6. Classmate A has always loved singing but never thought it was possible until now.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I recently finished a custom-made dining table for a client, and they were thrilled with the result. It's moments like those that make me love what I do even more.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about Classmates A's interest and efforts in starting a business, which is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Classmates A talks about their career as a carpenter. However, the connection between carpentry and the business venture is not clearly established in the MEMORY, as most sentences revolve around business ideas and plans without linking them to carpentry. The MEMORY does not demonstrate a strong development of the conversation related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about carpentry, and it lacks information on any big projects Classmates A might have undertaken, which was specifically mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the mention of singing in MEMORY point 6 is unrelated to both the dialogue context and any business ambitions, making it less helpful for generating the next response. Overall, while the MEMORY contains coherent and structured sentences, it fails to provide crucial contextual cues needed to respond meaningfully to the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
