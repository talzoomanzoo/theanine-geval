Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that. Neighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset? Neighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\n2. Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received.\n3. Neighbors A is detail-oriented and strives for perfection.\n4. Neighbors B values reciprocity and acknowledges the mutual help between them as neighbors.\n5. Neighbors A wants to rearrange their living room and Neighbors B has experience with rearranging furniture.\n6. Neighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship as neighbors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm sorry to hear that you had a tough day at work. Remember, everyone has those moments. If you ever need to talk more about it, I'm here to listen.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information about the past interactions between Neighbors A and B that could assist in generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, memory point 1 is directly relevant as it highlights Neighbors B's supportive and understanding nature, which aligns with the context where Neighbors B shows understanding for Neighbors A's frustration at work.\n\nHowever, other points in the MEMORY, such as Neighbors A's detail-oriented nature or the rearrangement of their living room, don't have a clear connection to the current dialogue about the incident at work. Although these points provide additional context to the relationship between Neighbors A and B, they are not immediately useful for generating a response in this particular instance.\n\nThe helpfulness score is a 3 because while the MEMORY contains relevant aspects, the lack of connection between some of the points and the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT detracts from its overall effectiveness."
