Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I can't believe how honored I am to be part of our class. I feel like we have something special going on here. Classmates B:  You're right. Our class definitely has a unique energy about it. What do you think sets us apart from other classes? Classmates A:  I think it's our sense of community. We all support each other and work together to achieve our goals. Classmates B:  That's definitely a big factor. And I also think our class has a lot of diversity, which brings new perspectives and ideas to the table. Classmates A:  Yes, absolutely. I love hearing everyone's different viewpoints and experiences. It really helps us all grow and learn. Classmates B:  And it's not just in the classroom, but also in extracurricular activities and events. We always have a strong turnout and participation. Classmates A:  I couldn't agree more. And I feel like being part of our class has made me a better person overall. I've learned so much and grown so much as a result.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B complimented Classmates A on their suit and brought up a past conversation about feelings.\n2. Classmate B feels relieved that they can still be friends with Classmate A.\n3. Classmates A values their friendship with Classmates B and looks forward to wearing a black suit to a wedding reception.\n4. Classmate A has been hiding their feelings for Classmate B and finally confesses to being in love with them.\n5. Classmate A is disappointed when Classmate B does not feel the same way.\n6. Classmates A confessed their love for Classmates B, who does not feel the same way.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains information about personal interactions and feelings between Classmates A and B, particularly focusing on a romantic aspect. However, this information does not significantly contribute to generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around the unique qualities of their class and the sense of community and diversity they experience. The memory mentions are mostly disconnected from this academic or community theme and focus more on personal emotions, making it of limited helpfulness in shaping the conversation about class dynamics and experiences. Furthermore, the memory entries are somewhat repetitive, specifically points 4, 5, and 6, which reiterate the same concept of unrequited love without further development or connection to the current discussion. This repetition and lack of relevance reduce its helpfulness for the task at hand."
