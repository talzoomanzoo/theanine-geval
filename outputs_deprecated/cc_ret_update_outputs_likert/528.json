Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess. Classmates B: Wait, what? You cheated on your taxes? That's not okay.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate B reassures Classmate A that they are all in it together and offers help if needed.\n2. Classmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed.\n3. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to keep pushing themselves and not let doubts hold them back.\n4. Classmate A has tried practicing in front of others but still feels nervous.\n5. Classmate B brought goods to Classmate A's house and is supportive of their basketball dream.\n6. Classmates A sometimes doubts if they are good enough to make it to the professional level.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains sentences that are not directly relevant or helpful to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on Classmate A's issue with being caught cheating on taxes and Classmate B's reaction to that revelation. On the other hand, the MEMORY entries appear to address different scenarios, such as encouragement towards personal goals, practicing in public, and pursuing a basketball dream, none of which connect with the immediate topic of tax cheating or Classmate A's current predicament. Consequently, the MEMORY lacks helpfulness for generating a proper continuation of the current dialogue, as it doesn't provide relevant background on the specific issue at hand or the interpersonal dynamics that are part of the current conversation."
