Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now! Neighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen? Neighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest. Neighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations! What are you going to do with all that money? Neighbors A: Well, first I'm going to pay off my mortgage and all my debts. After that, I think I'll take a nice long vacation and maybe donate some to charity. Neighbors B: That's very generous of you. Have you thought about investing any of it? Neighbors A: Yes, actually. I've been doing some research and I think I want to invest in some stocks and maybe even start my own business. Neighbors B: That sounds like a great idea. You have the opportunity to do so much with your newfound wealth.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A made a big career change recently and is much happier now.\n2. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's decision and admires the courage it took.\n3. Neighbors A took the leap to make a change and is glad they did.\n4. Neighbors B has been supportive of Neighbors A's job search, offering to connect them with people in different industries.\n5. Neighbors A and B had a conversation a couple of years ago about needing a change.\n6. Neighbors B has knowledge of people in different industries and is willing to help Neighbors A with their job search.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not closely align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on Neighbors A suddenly becoming a millionaire due to an inheritance and their plans with the newfound wealth. In contrast, the MEMORY is more related to Neighbors A's career change, job search, and Neighbors B's support and connections in that context. While supportive interactions are mentioned in both MEMORY and DIALOGUE CONTEXT, there is no direct link between the topics, with the inheritance and financial decisions being the main focus in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY may provide some insight into the dynamic between the neighbors but fails to offer relevant cues needed for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. There is a lack of clear, causal connection between the MEMORY and the current conversation, reducing its overall helpfulness."
