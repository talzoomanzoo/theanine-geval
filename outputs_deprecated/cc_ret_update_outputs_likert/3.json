Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life. Child: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you. Parent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you. Child: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The child offers help and reassurance to the parent.\n3. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n4. The parent had a tough time when they got arrested and had to rely on a lawyer and the justice system for help.\n5. The parent values independence and self-sufficiency.\n6. The parent wants to provide a safe and stable environment for the child.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several relevant pieces of information that can aid in generating an appropriate response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 4, which mentions the parent's tough time when they got arrested and had to rely on the justice system, is directly relevant to the child's question about feeling unheard, as it hints at a potentially similar context of feeling unsupported during difficult times. Sentence 1 is indirectly helpful, as it shows the parent's ability to find hope and appreciation in challenging situations, which complements the discussion about listening during tough times. The remaining sentences, though not directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, provide a clear picture of the parent-child dynamic and the parent's values, which could influence the style and tone of the parent's response. However, the connections are not all explicitly clear, which is why the score is not a 5. Nonetheless, the MEMORY is structured well enough and provides helpful contextual cues related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
