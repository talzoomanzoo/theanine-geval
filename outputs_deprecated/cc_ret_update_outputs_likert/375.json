Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to share something with you. I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend. Classmates B: That's really kind of you. What did you do to help?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support.\n2. Classmates A appreciates the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n3. Classmates B handled a previous mix-up with the class schedule well, showing responsibility and reliability.\n4. Classmates A and B started as acquaintances and have developed a strong friendship.\n5. Classmates A and B are making plans to spend time together outside of school.\n6. Classmates A and B had a mix-up with names in the past but resolved the issue through communication.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information about the relationship and past interactions between Classmates A and B, which could aid in producing a coherent and appropriate response for future dialogue. However, not all of these details are directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\n1. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support: While this shows a positive relationship and appreciation, it doesn't directly relate to the current context about helping a neighbor.\n2. Classmates A appreciates the support and friendship of Classmates B: This is a repetition, offering no new context.\n3. Classmates B handled a previous mix-up with the class schedule well, showing responsibility and reliability: This indicates B's reliability but doesn't connect to the neighbor assistance event.\n4. Classmates A and B started as acquaintances and have developed a strong friendship: This provides overall context about their friendship, which could be slightly relevant to understanding their supportive dynamic.\n5. Classmates A and B are making plans to spend time together outside of school: This indicates a strong friendship, yet doesn't directly connect to the present dialogue.\n6. Classmates A and B had a mix-up with names in the past but resolved the issue through communication: Shows problem-solving ability, which has minimal relevance to the current context.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides a general understanding of the relationship dynamics between A and B but falls short in offering specifics directly pertinent to Classmates A helping a neighbor. It is naturally written, and potentially helpful in a broader sense, but does not fully align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, resulting in a middle-ground score of 3."
