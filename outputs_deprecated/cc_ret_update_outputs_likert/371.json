Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message. Co-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident. Co-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows. Co-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive. Co-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right. Co-workers B: Speaking of convincing people, have you ever been in a physical altercation before? Co-workers A: Yes, unfortunately. But that doesn't mean I'm a danger to people. I just don't back down from a fight when I'm standing up for what's right. Co-workers B: That's understandable. Speaking of standing up for what's right, do you remember when you asked Karen for money and she was hesitant at first? Co-workers A: Yeah, I remember. But she eventually gave me the cash, and I was able to take care of what I needed to. Co-workers B: That's good. And speaking of taking care of things, your carpentry skills are amazing. I loved the house you built for me last year.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs.\n2. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument.\n3. Co-worker A is a skilled builder who recently completed building a house for Co-worker B.\n4. Co-worker A has experience dealing with challenging clients and emphasizes the importance of communication and setting expectations.\n5. Co-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\n6. Co-worker A appreciates the support and hard work put into the case.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides quite helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes sentences that reflect past interactions and skills of Co-worker A, which are useful for generating a proper next response. For example, points 3 and 5 directly align with topics being discussed, such as Co-worker A's carpentry skills and their emphasis on evidence in debates, which is relevant to their discussion about presenting persuasive arguments. The MEMORY does mention Co-worker A's ability to stand up for their beliefs and their work on a case, which also shows a connection to the dialogue about standing up for what's right and substantiating claims with facts. However, not all points are directly relevant to the immediate dialogue, such as dealing with challenging clients, but they are still naturally connected and informative about Co-worker A's character and skills. Thus, the MEMORY overall supports the development of the dialogue by providing background information and context that can guide the next response."
