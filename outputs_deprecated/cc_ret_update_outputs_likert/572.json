Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. Neighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off. Neighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks? Neighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n2. Neighbor A has skills in manipulation and getting what they want.\n3. Neighbor A considers Neighbor B a great neighbor and wanted to do something special for them.\n4. Neighbor A and Neighbor B discuss organizing a community event to make a positive impact and appreciate the beauty of their city.\n5. Neighbor B is against Neighbor A's idea, emphasizing the ethical and legal implications.\n6. Neighbors A values their friendship with Neighbors B, describing them as a great neighbor.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It might help to create a detailed schedule or set time limits for each task to stay on track. Sometimes a little structure can make a big difference in productivity.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information about the relationship between Neighbors A and B, such as Neighbor A valuing their friendship and describing Neighbor B as a great neighbor. However, most of the sentences are not directly helpful for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding focusing issues and procrastination. The MEMORY does not provide much information that can be readily applied to address the topic of project completion and distraction in the current conversation. Additionally, the structure of the sentences does not clearly demonstrate the development or connection between past interactions that would aid in generating a response in line with the conversation about productivity strategies. Thus, the MEMORY is not very helpful for this specific context."
