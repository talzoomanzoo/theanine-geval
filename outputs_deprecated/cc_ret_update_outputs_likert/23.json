Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water? Neighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for. Neighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit. Neighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n2. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n3. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n4. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n5. Both Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\n6. Neighbor A's mom scolds them for ripping off the tag from their new shirt.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful context about the relationship between Neighbors A and B. It suggests that they have a supportive relationship (1), have known each other for some time (4), and share activities such as spending time outside and mowing the lawn (5). This background information is helpful as it could explain the dynamics of their interaction in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Neighbor A initiated a prank and expects Neighbor B to be more light-hearted about it. However, sentences like (2) and (3) don't directly relate to the water prank incident, but they do build on the rapport between the neighbors. Sentence (6) doesn't relate to Neighbors A and B at all and doesn't help with understanding the context of their relationship. Overall, the MEMORY provides some helpful context but could be more directly relevant to the situation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
