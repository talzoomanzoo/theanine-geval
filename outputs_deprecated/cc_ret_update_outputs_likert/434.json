Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, have you ever tried to imagine what it would be like to think like someone else? Mentor: Yes, I have. It's a great way to better understand and empathize with others. Mentee: That's exactly what I thought. I've been trying to imagine what personY is thinking lately. It's been helping me to understand their perspective a bit better. Mentor: That's a great approach. Putting ourselves in someone else's shoes can help us see things from a different angle and see where they're coming from. Mentee: Exactly. And it also helps me to be more compassionate towards them. I think it's important for us to be more understanding and supportive of each other, especially in difficult times. Mentor: I agree completely. It's important to be kind and compassionate towards others, especially when they may be going through something challenging.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor became a mentor to help others going through similar situations.\n2. Mentee wants to make a positive impact in people's lives and is grateful for Mentor's support.\n3. Mentee agrees to try the advice and express gratitude towards Mentor.\n4. Mentor encourages Mentee to approach teaching religion with an open mind and heart.\n5. Mentee has been thinking about helping others who may be in abusive cults.\n6. Mentee is taking the idea of teaching religion seriously and wants to make a positive impact on people's lives.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I couldn't agree more, Mentor. Being able to show compassion and understanding in difficult times can make a huge difference in someone's life. It's something I really want to embody in my efforts to help others.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information on the aspirations and values of the Mentee and Mentor, but it is not highly relevant or directly connected to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The present conversation revolves around understanding others' perspectives and being compassionate, whereas the MEMORY primarily focuses on the Mentee's religious teaching aspirations and interest in helping people in abusive cults. Although points 1 and 2 offer some insight into the Mentor's motivation and the Mentee's desire to positively impact others, there is little direct overlap or development of the specific conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY seems fragmented and does not show clear causality or connection between the past interactions and the ongoing dialogue. Hence, it provides limited help for the language model to generate a coherent next response."
