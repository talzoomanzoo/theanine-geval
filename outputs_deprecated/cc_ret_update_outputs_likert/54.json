Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today? Co-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing. Co-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed. Co-workers B: That's really nice of you, but I don't want to burden you with my work. Co-workers A: It's not a burden if it's something I can do to support you. Plus, helping you out makes me feel good too. Co-workers B: You're right, thank you. You always go above and beyond to help me out. Co-workers A: That's what co-workers are for. We're a team and we need to support each other.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\n2. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health.\n3. Co-worker B agrees that their skill sets complement each other well.\n4. Co-worker A feels motivated about the future and is excited to work with Co-worker B.\n5. Co-worker A expressed gratitude for the horse that Co-worker B gave them, mentioning it brings joy and happiness.\n6. Co-worker A values their health to continue working at their best.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information about the supportive and collaborative relationship between Co-workers A and B, which relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the specific interactions in the MEMORY (e.g., Co-worker B offering help, encouraging health prioritization, and complementary skills) are mostly depicted from the opposite perspective and do not directly mirror the scenario presented in the dialogue context, where Co-worker A offers support to Co-worker B. Additionally, some details, such as the mention of gratitude for a horse, are unrelated to the current issue of workload support and teamwork. Overall, while there are hints of helpful information, the MEMORY lacks clear and direct relevance to smoothly guide the continuation of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, hence the relatively low score."
