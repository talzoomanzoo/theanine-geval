Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband is inspired by his wife to take action on his dreams and goals.\n2. The husband apologized and promised to involve the wife in his plans in the future.\n3. The husband values the wife's encouragement and positivity in his pursuit of his goals.\n4. The husband and wife are committed to each other and excited about their future together.\n5. The husband is excited about his progress on long-awaited plans and is putting in a lot of effort to make them a reality.\n6. The wife brings up past disappointment when the husband left without her, breaking a promise to wait for her.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds lovely, but I can't help but remember the last time you made plans without me. It's important to me that we prioritize our time together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several relevant pieces of information that can help generate an appropriate response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 2 and 6 indicate an instance of the husband leaving the wife out of plans, which is relevant to the current discussion about spending time together. Also, sentence 4 mentions their commitment and excitement about their future together, which ties into the idea of planning a weekend getaway. Sentence 1, 3, and 5, while not directly related, provide useful context about the husband's character and their relationship, such as his inspiration from his wife and his dedication to his goals. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured and provides helpful insight into the relationship dynamics, making it an effective tool for generating a thoughtful response. However, some sentences are slightly less connected to the specific proposal of a weekend getaway, thus the score of 4 instead of 5."
