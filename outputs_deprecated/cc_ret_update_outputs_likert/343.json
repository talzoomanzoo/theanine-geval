Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful. Co-workers B: Did you make sure to include all the necessary details?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B finished a project and sent it to the manager for review.\n2. Co-worker B appreciates the pen and thanks Co-worker A for the gesture.\n3. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a thoughtful gesture.\n4. Co-worker B acknowledges the importance of finding a balance between work and relaxation.\n5. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen that they still use.\n6. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a symbol of trust in their professional relationship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains information about Co-worker A giving Co-worker B a pen as a thoughtful gesture or symbol of trust, which may indicate they have a positive professional relationship. However, this is only somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Co-workers A and B discuss the submission of a written report. The MEMORY does not provide any information about the process of report creation or submission, actual tasks, content to be included, or any feedback related to the report. The MEMORY's development and causation are weak and do not directly assist in generating a response focused on the details Co-worker A provided in the report, as reflected in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the natural phrasing is somewhat helpful, the lack of relevant development related to the context limits it from being highly useful."
