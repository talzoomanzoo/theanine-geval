    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind? Classmates A: I know about your affair with that other woman. Classmates B: What are you talking about? I don't have an affair with anyone. Classmates A: Don't lie to me! I saw you together at the restaurant last week. Classmates B: That was just a business meeting. We were discussing a potential collaboration on a music project. Classmates A: I don't believe you. You're just trying to cover it up. I'm going to tell everyone and ruin your career. Classmates B: Why are you doing this? I thought we were friends.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B have a good relationship, with Classmates A expressing admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor.\n2. Classmates A suggests grabbing lunch together, showing an interest in spending more time with Classmates B.\n3. Both Classmates A and B enjoy talking to each other and consider themselves great study partners.\n4.

Classmates A and B are interested in biology and studying cells.\n6. Classmate B admires Classmate A's dedication and believes they have a knack for science.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some background information on the relationship between Classmates A and B, such as their good relationship, shared interests, and admiration for each other. However, it does not directly connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which involves a confrontation about an alleged affair. The MEMORY lacks specific information about previous interactions that might directly relate to the current tension or conflict in the dialogue. Although the MEMORY gives a slight insight into their past amicable relationship, it does not provide any details pertinent to clarifying or understanding the current conflict or Classmate B's defense. Consequently, it is only minimally helpful in generating a next response to the given dialogue."
