Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately. Classmates B: Why is that?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate A and Classmate B are classmates.\n2. Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness.\n3. Classmates A has not experienced similar pains in the past and is feeling worried about the situation.\n4. Classmates A is competitive and recently beat their brother in a race.\n5. Classmates A expresses gratitude for the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n6. Classmates B brings up a past event where Classmates A beat their brother in a race, highlighting their competitive nature.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some potentially helpful information about the relationship and characteristics of Classmates A and B. For instance, it highlights Classmate A's competitiveness and gratitude towards Classmate B, which could provide insight into their motivations or dynamics. However, the connection to the specific context of studying algebra is not strongly established. While Classmate A's competitiveness is mentioned (points 4 and 6), it doesn't clearly connect to their recent focus on studying algebra, unless it is inferred that competitiveness is the driving factor. Furthermore, the information about not experiencing pains and being worried (point 3) doesn't seem relevant to the algebra context either. The overall structure of MEMORY is a bit disjointed in terms of causality or relevance to the current dialogue about algebra, which slightly detracts from its helpfulness in generating a response."
