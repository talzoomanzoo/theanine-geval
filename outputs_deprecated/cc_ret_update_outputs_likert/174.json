Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on. Child: What is it, Parent? Parent: I created a website where I post advertisements, and people can pay to see them. Child: Oh, that's interesting. How does it work? Parent: Well, I create the ads myself, and then I post them on my website. People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Child is caring and offers help to the Parent.\n2. The parent and child have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores.\n3. The Parent is working and feels tired after a long day.\n4. The Child supports the idea of the Parent adopting more children and hopes for a happy home for them.\n5. The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings.\n6. The Child offers to bring water or make soup for the Parent while they are resting.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "**Helpfulness Score: 3**\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe MEMORY provided contains information about the relationship dynamics between the Parent and the Child, which could be somewhat helpful for generating the next response in the dialogue. However, the connection between the MEMORY and the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the Parent's project is indirect and not very strong.\n\n- Sentences 1 and 6 show that the Child is caring and supportive, which could help in the interaction if the dialogue takes a more personal or supportive turn, although there's no direct indication in the current context that such a turn will happen.\n- Sentence 2 suggests open communication about various topics which indicates a foundation for discussing new projects, but doesn't directly connect to the current context.\n- Sentences 3, 4, and 5, while reflecting on aspects of the Parent's life and aspirations, do not specifically relate to the dialogue about the website project.\n\nWhile the MEMORY conveys a positive and supportive relationship that might influence future interactions, it lacks specific details that would directly assist in generating a response about the project. Thus, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but lacks clear and direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as specified for a higher score."
