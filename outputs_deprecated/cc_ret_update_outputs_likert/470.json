Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing! Neighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go? Neighbors A: I visited Brazil and Peru. The culture and food were incredible. Neighbors B: That sounds awesome. I've always wanted to go to Peru to see Machu Picchu. Neighbors A: Yes, Machu Picchu is amazing. The view from the top is breathtaking. Neighbors B: Have you thought about where you want to go next?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and B believe in doing nice things for others to bring the community together.\n2. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's organization skills and wishes to improve their own organization.\n3. Neighbors A and B both took a cooking class together last year.\n4. Both Neighbors A and B believe in the importance of learning and self-improvement.\n5. Neighbor A is feeling frustrated and is considering going to a bar to find someone for a casual encounter.\n6. Neighbor B suggests finding other ways to relieve frustration and looking out for Neighbor A's well-being.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some general information about Neighbors A and B that could potentially provide context about their personalities and dynamics. For example, Memory points 1, 2, and 4 indicate shared values between neighbors A and B, such as community-building, organization, and self-improvement. However, this information does not directly relate to the dialogue context about Neighbors A's recent trip and subsequent travel aspirations. The MEMORY mostly lacks information that directly connects to the dialogue context or would help predict neighbors' responses, except maybe a vague connection between shared travel interests (point 4) and learning (e.g., travel as a learning experience). Also, point 5 and 6 are only tangentially relevant and don't provide useful context for response generation related to travel discussions. Overall, while MEMORY has some structured information about the neighbors' relationship, it doesn't significantly enhance the model's ability to generate a next response in the provided dialogue context."
