Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind? Classmates A: I know about your affair with that other woman.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B have a good relationship, with Classmates A expressing admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor.\n2. Classmates A suggests grabbing lunch together, showing an interest in spending more time with Classmates B.\n3. Both Classmates A and B are open to exploring a romantic connection and are looking forward to getting to know each other better.\n4. Both Classmates A and B enjoy talking to each other and consider themselves great study partners.\n5. Classmates A and B are interested in biology and studying cells.\n6. Classmate B admires Classmate A's dedication and believes they have a knack for science.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm sorry, but I think there might be a misunderstanding. I'm not involved in any affair with another woman. Let's clarify any confusion you have.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information about the relationship between Classmates A and B, indicating a positive rapport and mutual admiration. This background is relevant because it helps to understand the potential impact of the revelation about an affair on their relationship dynamics. However, the MEMORY could be more helpful if it contained more specific information about past interactions or incidents that are directly related to the current situation highlighted in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context of a potential romantic connection being explored could be particularly relevant, but the MEMORY lacks direct reference or connection to the affair mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, the MEMORY provides a general sense of their relationship but could be more directly related to the context at hand to score higher."
