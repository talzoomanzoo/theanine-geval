Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend! Co-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n2. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together.\n3. Co-worker A is observant and did some research on social media to find out that Co-worker B is married.\n4. Co-worker B is married and had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends.\n5. Co-worker A and Co-worker B used to work together at a clothing store.\n6. Co-worker A has a talent for solving puzzles and mysteries.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides limited helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around Co-worker A singing a solo at church, and Co-worker B's surprise at A's singing talent. While the MEMORY does present some insights into the relationship between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, such as shared work history and happy memories (sentences 2 and 5), these are not directly relevant to the topic of singing. The other sentences (1, 3, 4, and 6) do not provide information that would naturally guide a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT based on singing or church-related activities. The sentences in the MEMORY are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear development or causality directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, hence the low score."
