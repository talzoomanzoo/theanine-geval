Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager! Co-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role. Co-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge. Co-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail. Co-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products. Co-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader? Co-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader.\n2. Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n3. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n4. Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\n5. Co-worker B acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress.\n6. Co-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's amazing to see how far you've come since then. Your growth and confidence have truly shone through. I have no doubt that you'll continue to excel in your new role as a product manager.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY is quite helpful in providing background information that supports the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It effectively highlights Co-worker A's long-standing aspiration to become a leader and how their current promotion aligns with those aspirations. This context is clearly relevant to the conversation about the promotion to product manager, as it shows the development of Co-worker A's career over time. Additionally, the MEMORY captures the supportive role of Co-worker B and their acknowledgment of Co-worker A's growth, which is reflected in the dialogue when Co-worker B congratulates Co-worker A and expresses confidence in their abilities.\n\nHowever, there is some repetition in Co-worker A's aspirations to be a great leader across multiple sentences (2, 4, and 6), which might indicate a slight lack of distinctiveness among the points made. Nonetheless, the MEMORY as a whole remains relevant and well-structured enough to support the dialogue context effectively. This warrants a score of 4, as it effectively sets the stage without bringing in unrelated information."
