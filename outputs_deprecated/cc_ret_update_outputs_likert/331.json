Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going? Neighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you? Neighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band. Neighbors B: Really? You had a band?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbors B is familiar with Neighbors A's dog and looking forward to playing with it again.\n3. Neighbors B expresses concern for Neighbors A's back pain.\n4. Neighbors A is enjoying the different culture and exploring the city.\n5. Neighbors A mentions having back pain and needing a break.\n6. Neighbor B is interested in chiropractic care after hearing about Neighbor A's positive experience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, it was a fun time. We used to play gigs at local bars and just have a blast. It's a nice memory to look back on.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains various pieces of information, but most of them are not relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The dialogue context centers around Neighbor A discussing their past experience of having a rock band, which does not seem directly connected to the details in the memory. None of the sentences in MEMORY address this interaction directly or provide context that would contribute significantly to generating a proper next response. Some sentences, such as those about back pain and chiropractic care, may have potential if there is more context about past conversations on these topics, but without a direct link to the context, they don't contribute much. Therefore, the MEMORY lacks helpfulness in relation to the current dialogue context."
