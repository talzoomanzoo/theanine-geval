Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria. Co-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking? Co-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you? Co-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you. Co-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago? Co-workers B: Yeah, I remember that conversation. What about it? Co-workers A: Well, I wanted to share some good news with you. I've been recently promoted to the night shift and have been doing a great job. I think I've come a long way since those days. Co-workers B: That's awesome, congratulations! I'm proud of you and all the hard work you've put in. You've definitely grown and matured in the workplace. Co-workers A: Thank you, I appreciate that. But I have to admit, I'm still a bit nervous about being wrong. Remember when we talked about my constantly questioning myself and second-guessing my decisions? Co-workers B: Yeah, I remember that. Is there anything specific that's been bothering you? Co-workers A: Not really, it's just a general feeling of uncertainty at times. But hey, speaking of uncertainty, do you remember when we talked about my love for singing a while ago?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n2. Co-worker A expresses nervousness and self-doubt despite their achievements.\n3. Co-worker A is nervous about making mistakes in their new position.\n4. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A that making mistakes is okay as long as they learn from them.\n5. Co-worker A has been working hard on their singing skills and has a passion for music.\n6. Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, I remember our conversations about your passion for singing! Your dedication to improving your skills and pursuing your love for music is truly inspiring. It's amazing how you've been working hard in different aspects of your life. Keep that same determination and focus, and remember that it's okay to make mistakes along the way. Just like in music, learning from those mistakes only helps you grow even more.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided is quite helpful for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences capture key elements of the conversation, such as Co-worker A's nervousness and self-doubt, their achievements, Co-worker B's supportive role, and Co-worker A's passion for music. These not only align well with the topics discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but also reflect the underlying themes such as encouragement, personal growth, and mutual support between the co-workers.\n\nThe MEMORY sentences flow logically and provide a cohesive background of the past interactions that could impact the future continuation of the conversation. However, the connection between the memory regarding Co-worker A's singing skills and the current conversation, where they briefly mention their love for singing, is only indirectly helpful. Thus, the MEMORY misses a little in immediacy or thematic relevance to earn a perfect score, leading to a rating of 4 instead of 5."
