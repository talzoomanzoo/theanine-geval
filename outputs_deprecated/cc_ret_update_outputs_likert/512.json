Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I know you know something about my past. Can you tell me what it is? Classmates B: I'm sorry,, but I can't disclose that information. It's not my place to tell.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B warns Classmates A about the potential danger of dark alleys.\n2. Classmates A is curious and open to exploring new things and taking risks.\n3. Classmates B advises Classmates A to be careful and aware while on the bus.\n4. Classmates B appreciates the genuine friendship and positive attitude of Classmates A.\n5. Classmates A doesn't have their own car yet and takes the bus.\n6. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to keep striving towards their goals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains information about the relationship and interactions between Classmates A and B, which could potentially provide context for a dialogue between them. However, the MEMORY lacks direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about a request for specific information about Classmate A's past, which Classmate B refuses to disclose. In contrast, MEMORY entries primarily discuss advice, encouragement, and general traits, like classmate A's curiosity and use of public transportation, rather than past events or information that might shed light on Classmate A's curiosity about their past. While the MEMORY provides a general understanding of their relationship dynamics, it does not provide specific helpful information about past interactions related to the context of Aâ€™s past or B's reluctance to share information. Therefore, MEMORY's utility in generating contextually relevant responses is limited, resulting in a lower score."
