Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel really fulfilled as a leader and guide. Helping others gives me a sense of purpose. Co-workers B: I can see that. You always seem to know just what to do to make people feel better. Co-workers A: Yeah, I've had a lot of practice over the years. It's just something that comes naturally to me. Co-workers B: Do you remember that time when you were led to a safe place by the commander? You must have felt pretty grateful for his guidance then. Co-workers A: Absolutely. It was a really tough time and I was so relieved to have someone show me the way. I try to pay it forward by being that kind of leader for others. Co-workers B: That's a great attitude to have. Speaking of leadership, do you think you would ever want to take on a higher position in the company?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A had a positive experience with a commander who helped them feel safe.\n2. Co-worker B values finding fulfillment in work, pursuing hobbies, making a difference in the world, and building relationships with others.\n3. Co-worker A believes that everyone has the ability to create opportunities and make their own luck through hard work and seizing opportunities.\n4. Co-worker B emphasizes the importance of acknowledging privileges and using them to make the world a better place.\n5. Co-worker A values making money and is interested in opportunities to do so.\n6. Co-worker A is self-aware about being stubborn and needing to learn to compromise.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've definitely thought about it. I feel like I could make a bigger impact and create more opportunities for growth if I were in a higher position. But I also enjoy the hands-on aspect of my current role, so it's a tough decision to make.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided has some relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks a clear connection and structure that would significantly aid in generating a proper response. Sentence 1 is directly relevant, as it summarizes co-worker A's gratitude for the commander's guidance, which connects to the discussion about leadership and guidance in the dialogue. The other sentences (2, 3, 4, and 5) do provide character traits of the co-workers, but they don't directly connect to the dialogue's current context about leadership and potentially taking on a higher position. Sentence 6, although describing a personal trait of co-worker A, doesn't seem relevant to the topic of leadership in the current dialogue context. Overall, the MEMORY's helpfulness is average as it lacks a coherent connection between most of its sentences and the current dialogue context, although it provides some valuable character insights."
