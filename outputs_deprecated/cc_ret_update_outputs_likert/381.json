Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to share something with you. I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend. Classmates B: That's really kind of you. What did you do to help? Classmates A: She was moving and needed some extra hands to pack up her things and load them onto a truck. So I spent most of the day helping her out. Classmates B: Wow, that's really generous of you. I'm sure your neighbor really appreciated it. Classmates A: I hope so. I just felt like it was the right thing to do. I know if I were in that situation, I would appreciate any help I could get. Classmates B: Absolutely. It's important to be there for each other, especially in tough times. Classmates A: Yes, and it feels good to make a difference in someone's life, even if it's just in a small way. Classmates B: Definitely. It's the small acts of kindness that can make the biggest impact. Remembers when we talked about how I made sure the mix-up won't happen again? That was because I wanted to make a small impact, like you did for your neighbor.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support.\n2. Classmates A appreciates the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n3. Classmates B handled a previous mix-up with the class schedule well, showing responsibility and reliability.\n4. Classmates A and B started as acquaintances and have developed a strong friendship.\n5. Classmates B was initially worried about Classmates A going out with friends but they value each other's opinions.\n6. Classmates A and B value their friendship and feel comfortable talking to each other about anything.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I remember that. Your responsibility and reliability really shine through in moments like that. It's great to see how we both strive to make a positive impact, whether big or small, in our own ways.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful context for generating a response in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences highlight the friendship and mutual appreciation between Classmates A and B, which aligns with the tone and subject of the conversation in which they discuss helping others and making an impact. Specifically, sentences 1, 2, 4, and 6 are relevant as they emphasize the strong relationship and support between the two, which is a key theme in the dialogue. Sentence 3 is somewhat related as it alludes to a past event that demonstrates responsibility, which can connect to the notion of helping and supporting others. Sentence 5, though less directly tied to the dialogue, still provides insight into their relationship dynamics. Overall, the MEMORY contains naturally structured sentences that help a language model infer the context and past interactions, supporting an appropriate response generation."
