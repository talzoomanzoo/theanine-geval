Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately. Classmates B: Why is that? Classmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically. Classmates B: That's a good goal to have. Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra? Classmates A: Definitely. I feel like I'm able to break down problems and analyze them more effectively. Classmates B: It's always rewarding when hard work pays off. Classmates A: Yes it is. It reminds me of when I proved my brother wrong in that race. I was so determined to win and it paid off in the end. Classmates B: It's great to see that determination and hard work lead to success in different areas of life. Classmates A: And even when I felt that pain in my arm, I waited and it eventually went away. Classmates B: It's important to listen to your body and take care of yourself. Classmates A: Exactly. And sometimes, it's nice to just take a break and enjoy a quiet moment to yourself. Classmates B: Like when you were admiring the patterns in the ceiling?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness.\n2. Classmates B emphasizes the importance of enjoying the journey and effort put in, not just focusing on winning.\n3. Classmates B brings up a past event where Classmates A beat their brother in a race, highlighting their competitive nature.\n4. Classmates A expresses gratitude for the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n5. Classmate A emphasizes the importance of self-care and relaxation.\n6. Classmates B offers support and suggests taking a step back to find a balance.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, exactly! It's those little moments of peace that help recharge me. It's like finding a balance between pushing myself and taking time to relax.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some elements that are relevant and helpful to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically in the way that it acknowledges past interactions and development within their conversation. For instance, points 1 and 3 in the MEMORY reflect directly on Classmates A's determination and competitiveness, which ties into the context where Classmates A discusses their past race with their brother, as well as their goals in learning algebra. Additionally, points 5 and 6 relate to self-care, which is also discussed in the context when Classmates A mentions dealing with arm pain.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY lacks a smooth and logical flow capturing the development of the dialogue as a whole, and some entries like point 4 about gratitude and friendship are not directly tied to the current context, which could confuse the language model in identifying what's most relevant to continuing the dialogue.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides some useful cues but could be organized in a way that more strongly delineates the flow and relevance of past interactions to the ongoing dialogue."
