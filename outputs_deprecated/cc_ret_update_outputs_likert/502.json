Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria. Co-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking? Co-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you? Co-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you. Co-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago? Co-workers B: Yeah, I remember that conversation. What about it? Co-workers A: Well, I wanted to share some good news with you. I've been recently promoted to the night shift and have been doing a great job. I think I've come a long way since those days.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n2. Co-workers A and B have worked together on a big story in the past.\n3. Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A.\n4. Co-worker A is managing the night shift by getting enough rest during the day and staying focused.\n5. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B acknowledge the importance of taking responsibility for their actions and learning from mistakes.\n6. Co-worker A is trying to be more conscious of how their actions impact others and avoid causing problems for anyone else.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it includes past interactions and characteristics of the co-workers that are beneficial for understanding the flow of the current conversation. For example, item 5 directly ties to Co-worker A's acknowledgment of personal growth and responsibility, which is a key component of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Item 1 and 3 depict Co-worker B's supportive nature, aligning with the supportive conversation tone. The MEMORY also includes descriptions of Co-worker A's progress, such as managing the night shift (item 4), which corresponds to their promotion mentioned in the context. However, not all of the points in MEMORY are directly addressed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT (such as item 2 about working on a big story), but they are naturally phrased and do not detract from understanding past interactions. This MEMORY allows for a language model to generate responses that recognize the dynamics and personal growth in the conversation."
