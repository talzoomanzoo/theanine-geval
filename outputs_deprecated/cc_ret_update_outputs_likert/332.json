    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going? Neighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you? Neighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band. Neighbors B: Really? You had a band? Neighbors A: Yeah, we were called \"The Neighbors A Band.\" We used to play live shows around the city.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbors B is familiar with Neighbors A's dog and looking forward to playing with it again.\n3. Neighbors B expresses concern for Neighbors A's back pain.\n4. Neighbors A is enjoying the different culture and exploring the city.\n5. Neighbor B is interested in chiropractic care after hearing about Neighbor A's positive experience.\n6. Neighbors A packed up their belongings and moved into a small apartment in London.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's so cool! I had no idea you were in a band. What instrument did you play?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains only one slightly relevant sentence to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is sentence 4 â€” mentioning Neighbors A exploring the city. This could relate to Neighbors A's mention of playing live shows around the city with their band, but it lacks a direct connection to the context of discussing the band itself. Most of the MEMORY's content seems to be focused on other unrelated topics like dogs, back pain, and moving, which do not contribute directly to generating a response about the band or musical interests. The sentences do not offer clear causality or development relevant to the current conversation regarding Neighbor A's past with the rock band."
