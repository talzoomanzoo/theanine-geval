    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to share something with you. I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend. Classmates B: That's really kind of you. What did you do to help? Classmates A: She was moving and needed some extra hands to pack up her things and load them onto a truck. So I spent most of the day helping her out. Classmates B: Wow, that's really generous of you. I'm sure your neighbor really appreciated it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support.\n2. Classmates A appreciates the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n3. Classmates B handled a previous mix-up with the class schedule well, showing responsibility and reliability.\n4. Classmates A and B started as acquaintances and have developed a strong friendship.\n5. Classmates A and B are making plans to spend time together outside of school.\n6. Classmates A and B value their friendship and feel comfortable talking to each other about anything.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks, I just felt like it was the right thing to do. Plus, it was great to see the smile on her face when everything was sorted out.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information about the relationship between Classmates A and B, illustrating the development and strength of their friendship. Sentences 1, 2, and 4 highlight the appreciation and closeness between the two, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as Classmates B is supportive and complimentary towards Classmates A's actions. While these sentences are helpful in providing context about their friendship, other sentences (like 3) are disjointed from the specific helping scenario discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, and details about previous events or future plans (like 3 and 5) do not provide direct cues for generating the next response. Despite this, the authentic phrasing allows the model to easily sift through which sentences may inform a response regarding their appreciation for each other. Thus, the MEMORY merits a mid-level score for its usefulness in crafting a response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
