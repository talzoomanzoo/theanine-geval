Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A is excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends.\n2. Neighbors A appreciates having friendly faces around and hopes to make new friends soon.\n3. Neighbors A just moved to a new neighborhood and is getting to know the area.\n4. Neighbors B acknowledges Neighbors A's friendly and outgoing nature.\n5. Neighbors A enjoys living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B.\n6. Neighbors A found a park and a coffee shop nearby that they want to visit.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant and helpful information but lacks a clear connection to the specific details of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While it provides context about Neighbors A's excitement to explore and make new friends and their appreciation for the neighborhood's friendliness (in sentences 1, 2, 3, and 5), it doesn't explicitly connect to the \"amazing new city\" being visited. Sentence 3 and 5 show that Neighbors A just moved to a new neighborhood and feels comfortable, providing contextual cues on why they might find a new city amazing, but does not delve into aspects of the city visit itself. Sentence 6 about finding a park and coffee shop nearby hints at exploration but is not directly linked to the visiting of a new city. The memory is structured naturally and provides some insights into Neighbor A's character and background, but it could be more directly associated with the recent visit to the city mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT to achieve a higher score."
