Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway? Wife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go? Husband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city. Wife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change. Husband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think? Wife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband is excited about his progress on long-awaited plans and is putting in a lot of effort to make them a reality.\n2. The husband is inspired by his wife to take action on his dreams and goals.\n3. The husband apologized and promised to involve the wife in his plans in the future.\n4. The husband and wife are committed to each other and excited about their future together.\n5. The husband values the wife's encouragement and positivity in his pursuit of his goals.\n6. The wife is supportive and proud of her husband for working towards his goals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad you're excited about it, wife. It's going to be a wonderful time for us to unwind and enjoy each other's company without any distractions.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a moderately helpful context for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY contains several sentences that give insight into the couple's dynamic, such as the husband's motivation to make plans (sentence 1) and their commitment to each other (sentence 4). However, while these sentiments align with the intention to spend quality time together, the connection between these memories and the specific dialogue about a weekend getaway is somewhat abstract. The sentences are naturally structured and demonstrate the couple's supportive relationship, which is relevant to the context, but the direct applicability to planning a getaway could be more explicit. Therefore, the MEMORY partially supports the generation of a response, meriting a middle score."
