Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life. Child: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you. Parent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n3. The child offers help and reassurance to the parent.\n4. The parent values independence and self-sufficiency.\n5. The parent wants to provide a safe and stable environment for the child.\n6. Both the parent and child enjoy spending time together in their new home.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I agree, feeling heard and understood is so comforting, especially during tough times. I'm here for you, just like you've always been there for me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains general information about the Parent and Child's relationship and individual values, such as the Parent's appreciation of small moments, the Child's offer of help, and the Parent's values and wishes. However, it lacks specific connections or developments related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on the importance of listening, especially during tough times. The sentences in the MEMORY are reasonably well-structured, but they don't provide direct contextual relevance or cues that help generate the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the MEMORY gives some insight into their interactions and shared values, it does not directly tie to the theme of listening or provide background that enhances understanding of this particular dialogue. Hence, it doesn't offer substantial benefit for generating the next response concerning the specific context of being a good listener."
