Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today? Classmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own. Classmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others. Classmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone. Classmates A: You're not a burden, don't worry. And I'm always here to help you out. Classmates B: I appreciate that, but I don't want to always rely on others. I want to be more independent. Classmates A: I get it. Maybe there are some small things you can do on your own to start feeling more independent? Classmates B: Like what? Classmates A: Well, maybe you can start by making a list of things you'd like to do on your own and we can work on achieving those goals together.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as evidenced by their conversation about their respective experiences.\n2. Classmates B finds it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after a conversation they had about following dreams.\n3. Classmates A enjoys reminiscing about childhood memories, particularly about playing on swings and making music with friends.\n4. Classmates A and B are both keeping up with the homework in their math class.\n5. Classmates B is interested in learning to play an instrument.\n6. Classmates A and B enjoy jamming together and plan to collaborate on music in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! I'd love to work on that list with you. It could be a good way for me to take small steps towards independence. Thanks for being so supportive!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains a mix of helpful and less relevant information for generating a response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 5 provide some relevant contextual information â€“ the supportive relationship between Classmates A and B and Classmates B's interest in learning to play an instrument, which can be connected to pursuing independence. Other sentences, such as 2, 3, 4, and 6, while naturally structured and provide background on their interactions or shared interests, are not directly related to the main theme of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is Classmates B's desire for independence. Overall, MEMORY includes some helpful context but lacks a direct focus on the immediate concerns expressed by Classmates B in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
