Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work. Wife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help. Husband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff. Wife: Nonsense! You can always come to me with anything. Plus, I enjoy helping you with your creative process. Have you also tried revisiting some of the writing prompts we did in our creative writing class? Husband: I have, but I feel like I'm just repeating the same stories over and over again. Wife: Maybe it's time to take a step back and try something new. Have you ever tried writing in a different genre or experimenting with different styles? Husband: That's a good idea. I guess I just haven't had the courage to step out of my comfort zone.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Wife suggests that husband should try using more modern language to be better understood.\n2. The wife reassures the husband that it's okay to be different and encourages him to embrace who he is.\n3. Wife brings up Sarah, the husband's previous partner, but husband says he hasn't thought about her much.\n4. Husband agrees to try adapting to modern language for better communication with his wife.\n5. The wife compares the situation to when the husband fell asleep during a movie she recommended, indicating past issues in their relationship.\n6. The wife remembers the husband being nervous before the presentation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's completely understandable to feel apprehensive about trying something new, but remember, growth often comes from stepping outside of what's familiar. I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I believe in your ability to explore different genres and styles in your writing. It might just be the creative spark you need to break through that feeling of being stuck.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does have a few elements that could potentially help a model generate a response. For example, points 1 and 4, which discuss communication styles, could be tangentially related to the husband's creative struggles. However, most of the memory points, such as discussions about Sarah (point 3), the movie incident (point 5), and past nerves about a presentation (point 6), are not directly relevant to the context of the husband's writing challenges and creative process blocking. These elements are not naturally structured around the development of the current conversation. Additionally, they don't align well with the dialogue context or provide significant insights into the interaction between the husband and the wife regarding his writing struggles. Thus, as a whole, the memory does not effectively aid the model in crafting a response relevant to the current context."
