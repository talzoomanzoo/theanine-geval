Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I know you know something about my past. Can you tell me what it is? Classmates B: I'm sorry,, but I can't disclose that information. It's not my place to tell. Classmates A: But how did you find out? I haven't told anyone. Classmates B: Let's just say I have my ways of finding out things. But don't worry,, it's nothing bad or embarrassing. Classmates A: Okay, but it's still bothering me that you know something about me that even my closest friends don't know. Classmates B: I understand how you feel, but sometimes it's best to keep certain things to ourselves. Trust me, it's for your own good.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B warns Classmates A about the potential danger of dark alleys.\n2. Classmates B advises Classmates A to be careful and aware while on the bus.\n3. Classmates A is curious and open to exploring new things and taking risks.\n4. Classmates A was nervous about fitting in but saw Classmates B as well-liked and wanted to be friends with them.\n5. Classmates B appreciates the genuine friendship and positive attitude of Classmates A.\n6. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to keep striving towards their goals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several details about the relationship and interactions between Classmates A and B. However, the majority of the sentences are not directly relevant or helpful to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context discusses Classmate A's concern about Classmate B knowing their secret, while the MEMORY consists of unrelated interactions, such as warnings about safety and encouragement towards goals. Only a couple of sentences (4 and 5) in the MEMORY give some context to their interpersonal relationship, but they don't help in generating a next response that addresses the current dialogue about secrets and privacy. Overall, the MEMORY lacks clear development, causality, or connection to the ongoing conversation, and does not provide helpful information to guide the response."
