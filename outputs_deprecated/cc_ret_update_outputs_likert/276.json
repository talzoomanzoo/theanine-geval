Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel really fulfilled as a leader and guide. Helping others gives me a sense of purpose. Co-workers B: I can see that. You always seem to know just what to do to make people feel better. Co-workers A: Yeah, I've had a lot of practice over the years. It's just something that comes naturally to me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B values finding fulfillment in work, pursuing hobbies, making a difference in the world, and building relationships with others.\n2. Co-worker A had a positive experience with a commander who helped them feel safe.\n3. Co-worker A believes that everyone has the ability to create opportunities and make their own luck through hard work and seizing opportunities.\n4. Co-worker B emphasizes the importance of acknowledging privileges and using them to make the world a better place.\n5. Co-worker A values making money and is interested in opportunities to do so.\n6. Co-worker A is self-aware about being stubborn and needing to learn to compromise.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's amazing to see how your experiences have shaped you into such a supportive and caring leader. Your natural ability to make people feel better is truly a gift.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains mutually beneficial information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it mentions Co-worker A's belief in creating opportunities through hard work, which relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Co-worker A discusses their role as a leader and guide. It also references Co-worker B's emphasis on making a difference in the world and building relationships, which connects to their recognition of Co-worker A's ability to help others feel better. However, some sentences lack direct relevance to generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Co-worker A valuing making money. While the MEMORY provides contextual cues, not all are naturally structured or connected to the current interaction, hence a score in the middle range."
