Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned? Classmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during the difficult situation.\n2. Classmates A is stranded in space, running out of oxygen and feeling lightheaded.\n3. Classmates A helped Classmates B out of friendship and believes in supporting each other.\n4. Classmates B praised Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n5. Classmates A and B have been on field trips to other planets or moons before, like Mars.\n6. Classmate B struggles with parallel parking but is grateful for Classmate A's patience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Embarrassed? Don't worry, we all have our moments. Is it about the parallel parking incident earlier?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides very little relevant information directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Classmates A is inquiring about Classmates B's red and splotchy face, and the response about embarrassment could potentially be linked to a past event of embarrassment or support between the classmates. However, the MEMORY largely contains unrelated events, such as being stranded in space, field trips to other planets, and even parallel parking struggles. These events do not naturally connect or provide causality to the current conversation about Classmates B's embarrassment. While a few sentences suggest a supportive dynamic (e.g., Classmates A's support during difficult times), which might hint at a caring relationship, the MEMORY lacks sufficient helpfulness and contextual relevance to the specific dialogue, resulting in a mostly disconnected or minimally beneficial set of information."
