Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A has experience dealing with challenging clients and emphasizes the importance of communication and setting expectations.\n2. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs.\n3. Co-worker A agrees to be more conscious of how they come across to others in the future.\n4. Co-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\n5. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument.\n6. Co-worker A is a skilled builder who recently completed building a house for Co-worker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fantastic to hear! Your passion for public speaking really shines through. Have you ever considered leading a workshop on effective communication in the workplace?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information that could be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Co-worker A being involved in communication with challenging clients and having the courage to stand up for their beliefs. These details could complement the context of enjoying public speaking as a way to connect and convey messages.\n\nHowever, many entries in the MEMORY do not directly relate to public speaking or the particular context provided. For example, details about collecting evidence, building a house, or being skilled in construction do not connect clearly with the context of public speaking. Additionally, details like the use of statistics and personal accounts, while related to communication, are not directly connected to the current context of enjoying public speaking. \n\nOverall, the MEMORY lacks a clear, cohesive narrative that ties directly into the context of public speaking, reducing its helpfulness for generating an informed response by the language model."
