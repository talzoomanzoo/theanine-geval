Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm really excited about finding a buyer for my product. I think it has a lot of potential. Neighbors B: That's great to hear, what kind of product is it? Neighbors A: It's a new type of workout equipment that's designed to be more efficient than traditional equipment. I've been working on it for months now and I really think it's going to take off. Neighbors B: Wow, that sounds interesting. Have you started looking for potential buyers? Neighbors A: Yes, I've been reaching out to various gyms and fitness centers to see if they'd be interested in carrying the product. I've even gotten some positive feedback from a few places. Neighbors B: That's awesome! I'm sure with your determination, you'll find the perfect buyer soon.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's efforts to change and become a better version of themselves.\n2. Neighbors B expresses a desire for Neighbors A to succeed and emphasizes the importance of treating others with respect and putting in effort at work.\n3. Neighbors A is trying to improve their behavior at work and be a better colleague.\n4. Neighbors A and Neighbors B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as they enjoy having coffee and chatting together.\n5. Neighbors B appreciated Neighbors A's support during this difficult situation.\n6. Neighbors A noticed that Neighbors B's dog has been missing for a few days.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks for believing in me, it means a lot. I'm just hoping to make a positive impact in the fitness industry with this product.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some general information about the relationship between Neighbors A and B, but it does not provide specific details that align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the workout equipment product that Neighbors A is trying to sell. The memory entries largely focus on the personal dynamics between the two individuals, such as support and relationship aspects, without directly addressing the context of finding a buyer or the product itself. While the supportive nature of Neighbors B could somewhat relate to Neighbors A's efforts, the information is too vague and indirect to be very helpful for generating a relevant response to the specific dialogue. This results in a low score as the MEMORY lacks direct connection or helpful details related to Neighbors A's product and current situation discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
