Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n2. Co-worker B is married and had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends.\n3. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together.\n4. Co-worker A is observant and did some research on social media to find out that Co-worker B is married.\n5. Co-worker A and Co-worker B used to work together at a clothing store.\n6. Co-worker A has a talent for solving puzzles and mysteries.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's awesome! I bet you sounded amazing. How did it feel to sing in front of everyone?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains information about Co-worker A and Co-worker B's past interactions and personal details. However, it does not offer much helpful context directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Co-worker A shares that they sang a solo at church. While the MEMORY mentions shared memories and Co-worker A's talents, these details do not contribute significantly to generating a proper response to the specific context of singing a solo. The information is somewhat structured but lacks a direct connection to the current conversation, making it difficult for a language model to utilize this MEMORY effectively in this context."
