    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life. Child: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you. Parent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you. Child: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you? Parent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference. Child: I'm glad you found someone to talk to. You know, I remember when we watched the sunrise together a few weeks ago. That was really special.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n3. The Parent eventually got to see the sunrise after leaving detention.\n4. The child offers help and reassurance to the parent.\n5. The Parent and Child plan to watch the sunrise together in the future.\n6. The parent had a tough time when they got arrested and had to rely on a lawyer and the justice system for help.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it could be more directly relevant. Items like \"The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations,\" and \"The child offers help and reassurance to the parent\" capture the supportive dynamic between the Parent and Child, which is relevant to the ongoing conversation about listening and emotional support. However, other details, such as \"The Parent eventually got to see the sunrise after leaving detention,\" are less directly relevant to the context of the current dialogue. These entries could be more cohesive in connecting to the context directly. The MEMORY partially conveys the development of the Parent and Child's interactions and provides some context, but overall, it could be more structured to highlight the direct relevance and causality in their conversations."
