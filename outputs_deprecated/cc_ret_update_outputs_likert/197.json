Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager! Co-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role. Co-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge. Co-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail. Co-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products. Co-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader.\n2. Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\n3. Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n4. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n5. Co-worker B acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress.\n6. Co-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY is very helpful for generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences clearly demonstrate the progression and connections between past interactions of Co-worker A and Co-worker B. The MEMORY highlights Co-worker A's aspirations and dreams of leadership, which directly relate to Co-worker A's recent promotion and the related dialogue. Additionally, the MEMORY includes Co-worker B's role in acknowledging and supporting Co-worker A's growth, which is reflected in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as Co-worker B congratulates Co-worker A and expresses confidence in their abilities. The structured nature of the MEMORY allows the language model to easily derive important contextual cues, making it highly effective."
