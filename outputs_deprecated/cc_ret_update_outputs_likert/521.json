Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together. Neighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left? Neighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him. Neighbors B: That's not true, Neighbor A. You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n2. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have a close friendship and have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n3. Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.\n4. Neighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there.\n5. Neighbor A and Neighbor B are neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood.\n6. Neighbor A finds solace in nature and believes that it helps in coping with their emotions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you for saying that, Neighbor B. It means a lot to hear that from you. I just need some time to process everything and figure out how to move forward.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe memory contains some relevant information that could help a language model generate a proper next response. Memory items 1 and 2 are somewhat relevant because they reinforce the supportive relationship between Neighbor B and Neighbor A, aligning with the context where Neighbor B is consoling Neighbor A. Memory item 6 might also be slightly useful as it can hint at a way Neighbor A might cope with their emotions, reflecting the emotional theme in the dialogue context. However, memory items 3, 4, and 5 are mostly unrelated to the immediate emotional issue being discussed, though they provide some background context on Neighbor A's life. While there are some helpful aspects, the memory isn't tightly connected or relevant enough throughout to warrant a score higher than a 3. The structure and phrasing are decent, but more specific memories directly related to the breakup and Neighbor A's feelings would enhance the memory's helpfulness."
