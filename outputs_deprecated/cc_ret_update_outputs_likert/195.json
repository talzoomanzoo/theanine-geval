Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager! Co-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role. Co-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge. Co-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader.\n2. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n3. Co-worker B acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress.\n4. Co-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication.\n5. Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\n6. Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response as it highlights Co-worker A's journey and aspirations related to leadership, which aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Co-worker A shares the news of a promotion to product manager. Sentences 1 and 2 specifically mention Co-worker A taking on more responsibility and growing more confident, which directly relates to the excitement and nervousness expressed in the context. Sentence 3 indicates Co-worker B's supportive role, mirroring their supportive response in the context. However, the latter sentences in the MEMORY, particularly sentence 5 and 6, might be less structured and somewhat repetitive regarding fantasies, rather than on tangible growth, slightly reducing the clarity of the past development narrative. Nevertheless, the MEMORY overall provides useful context cues that aid in generating a coherent and contextually relevant response."
