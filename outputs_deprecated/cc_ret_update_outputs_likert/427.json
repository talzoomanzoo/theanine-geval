Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me. Co-workers B: That's amazing to hear. Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job. Co-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work. Co-workers B: It's great to have that kind of positive reinforcement. Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated? Co-workers A: Oh yeah, I remember. I was so angry after blowing up that rabbit with the dynamite. But talking it out with you really helped me work through my emotions. Co-workers B: That's right. It's important to have someone to talk to when you're feeling overwhelmed or upset. Co-workers A: And speaking of talking it out, do you remember when I was a kid and I ran to our parents screaming because of that spider? Co-workers B: Ha, yes I do! It's funny to think about now, but phobias are no laughing matter.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B acknowledges that some people have fears and suggests finding healthy ways to deal with frustrations.\n2. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.\n3. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to try relaxation techniques or find a hobby to de-stress and overcome fears.\n4. Co-worker A had a tough week on set, feeling overwhelmed and chaotic.\n5. Co-worker A had a childhood experience of freaking out over a spider.\n6. Co-worker A and Co-worker B met on a movie set and are now good friends.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "They definitely aren't! It's amazing how those childhood fears can stick with us. Thankfully, I've come a long way since then, especially with your encouragement to find healthy ways to cope with fears and frustrations.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a decently helpful set of cues relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Memory sentence 1 ties to the discussion on dealing with emotions (e.g., when Co-worker A was frustrated), and sentence 3â€™s suggestion of strategies to manage stress and fears connects to themes in the dialogue (e.g., Co-worker A's frustration and childhood fear of spiders). Sentence 2 reflects the constructive relationship and collaboration between the co-workers, and this compliments the context of working positively together and having a supportive environment. Sentence 4, though not directly mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, provides a backdrop for Co-worker A's emotions on set. Sentence 5 is directly relevant as it reflects the childhood spider anecdote in the dialogue. Finally, sentence 6 provides context on how Co-worker A and Co-worker B met and became good friends, which is supportive context for their dynamic interactions shown. Overall, most of the MEMORY information is either directly relevant or provides a helpful context that resonates with the dialogue interactions, making it a 4 in helpfulness."
