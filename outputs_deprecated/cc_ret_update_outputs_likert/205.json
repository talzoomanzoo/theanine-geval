Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager! Co-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role. Co-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge. Co-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail. Co-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.

Co-workers A: We definitely did. And it taught me to just take things one step at a time, like I am with this new role. Co-workers B: Exactly, and I'm sure you'll apply that same mentality to your training as well. I remember you were really dedicated to it a couple of years ago. Co-workers A: Oh yeah, I still try to keep up with it whenever I can. It's important to stay physically and mentally fit, especially with this new job. Co-workers B: Just don't let your anger get the better of you again. Remember when you exploded and started throwing things?\n\nMEMORY:\n1.

    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly highlighting Co-worker A's aspirations for leadership and the acknowledgment of their growth by Co-worker B. This aligns with the promotion to product manager and discussions about leadership within the dialogue. However, the MEMORY lacks natural connection and causality in its phrasing, as the sentences are somewhat repetitive and do not fully capture the detailed interactions and developments discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While MEMORY sentences touch on key themes, they do not provide enough detailed context or narrative development to be fully helpful for generating a nuanced response, resulting in a mid-range score."
