Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately. Classmates B: Why is that? Classmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically. Classmates B: That's a good goal to have. Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness.\n2. Classmate A and Classmate B are classmates.\n3. Classmates B emphasizes the importance of enjoying the journey and effort put in, not just focusing on winning.\n4. Classmates A expresses gratitude for the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n5. Classmates B offers support and suggests taking a step back to find a balance.\n6. Classmates B brings up a past event where Classmates A beat their brother in a race, highlighting their competitive nature.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Definitely! I feel like I'm becoming more analytical and better at problem-solving. It's challenging, but I enjoy the process of learning and growing.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating responses based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks a direct connection and causality to fully support a high rating. The first two sentences acknowledge the relationship and the traits of Classmates A, which partially fits the context of striving for self-improvement through studying algebra. Sentence 3 emphasizes enjoying the journey, which can be subtly related to the discussion about learning, but it's not highly relevant. Sentences 4 and 5 may hint at a supportive environment that can be related to current encouragement in studies. Sentence 6 adds depth to Classmates A's competitive nature, which indirectly supports their determination to improve via algebra. Overall, while elements from MEMORY can be tied to the context, it lacks a strong, naturally-phased connection to the algebra discussion to justify a score higher than 3."
