Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I know you know something about my past. Can you tell me what it is? Classmates B: I'm sorry,, but I can't disclose that information. It's not my place to tell. Classmates A: But how did you find out? I haven't told anyone. Classmates B: Let's just say I have my ways of finding out things. But don't worry,, it's nothing bad or embarrassing.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B warns Classmates A about the potential danger of dark alleys.\n2. Classmates A is curious and open to exploring new things and taking risks.\n3. Classmates B advises Classmates A to be careful and aware while on the bus.\n4. Classmates A encountered a mysterious woman in a dark alley, finding her intriguing.\n5. Classmates A was nervous about fitting in but saw Classmates B as well-liked and wanted to be friends with them.\n6. Classmates B appreciates the genuine friendship and positive attitude of Classmates A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information but lacks a strong connection to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which involves a conversation about Classmates A's past and Classmates B's knowledge of it. \n\n1. Entries 1 and 4 mention Classmates A encountering potentially dangerous situations, which could hint at aspects of their past that Classmates B knows about. However, these entries do not explicitly link to the context of Classmates B knowing something about Classmates A's past.\n\n2. Entry 2 describes Classmates A's personality as curious and open to risks, which may partially explain how information about their past might have emerged, but it's not directly related to the current dialogue.\n\n3. Entries 5 and 6 provide background on the relationship between the speakers, with A wanting to be friends with B and B appreciating A's friendship. These entries can help explain the dynamics between the two but do not offer direct context for the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\n4. Entry 3, regarding bus safety, is irrelevant to the dialogue context of A's past.\n\nOverall, MEMORY includes some elements that could potentially relate to the dialogue context but lacks direct connections and causality that would considerably aid in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The individual statements are well-structured and hint at a history, which gives MEMORY an average score, but stronger ties to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are needed for a higher score."
