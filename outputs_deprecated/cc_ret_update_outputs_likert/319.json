Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today? Co-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there? Co-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done. Co-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded. Co-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides.\n2. Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits.\n3. Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions.\n4. Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides.\n5. Co-worker A enjoys the extra space in their new place and appreciates the separation between living and sleeping areas for privacy.\n6. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to give people a chance.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information about Co-worker A's personal habits, living situation, and Co-worker B's concerns and advice about those habits and situations. However, these details are not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which centers around a discussion about a trip to the post office. While some memory sentences provide a general sense of the relationship between the co-workers (e.g., Co-worker B's supportive nature and Co-worker A's attempts to improve), they do not offer specific contextual cues that would assist in generating the next response for the conversation at hand. The MEMORY lacks direct connection or causality to the current discussion, reducing its helpfulness in continuing the dialogue naturally."
