Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn. Teacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation? Student: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle. Teacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The teacher and student have a positive and understanding relationship.\n2. The student mentioned feeling stressed lately, which may have led to the outburst.\n3. The teacher expressed understanding and encouraged the student to seek help when needed.\n4. The student once saved a kid from drowning and had a moment of yelling at the teacher in the past.\n5. The student felt rewarded by the experience and emphasized the importance of being aware of surroundings and acting quickly in emergencies.\n6. The teacher advises the student on effective communication and problem-solving, emphasizing the importance of talking calmly and finding solutions together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does not provide significant helpful information directly related to the \"hot sauce\" discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While it describes a positive relationship between the teacher and student and references past interactions, much of it is irrelevant to the current conversation about spicy food. Only the first memory point can possibly be useful as it implies a positive dynamic that could influence future interactions in the context. Other memory points, such as the student saving a kid from drowning or advising on communication, do not inform the topic at hand and thus do not help in generating the next response effectively based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These past events are detailed and naturally phrased, yet they lack immediate relevance to spicy food or building spice tolerance discussions."
