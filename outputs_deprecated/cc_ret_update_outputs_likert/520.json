Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together. Neighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left? Neighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.\n2. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n3. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have a close friendship and have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n4. Neighbor A's old apartment building was not the best place to live in.\n5. Neighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there.\n6. Neighbor A and Neighbor B are neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Neighbor A, I understand how you're feeling right now. It's completely normal to have those thoughts, but please remember that your worth is not defined by someone else's actions. You are more than enough just as you are. If you ever need to talk or just spend some time together, I'm here for you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some potentially helpful information, such as Neighbor B offering support and companionship (which could apply to the support Neighbor B is offering in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT) and their close friendship. However, most of the memory points do not directly address or provide context for the relationship issues Neighbor A is currently experiencing in the dialogue context. The connection between the memory items and how they relate to the current emotional state and situation of Neighbor A is not explicitly clear, which limits their helpfulness. Although there is some context showing the supportive nature of the relationship, the memory as a whole doesn't significantly aid in predicting or informing the next response related to the breakup conversation. The sentence structures are natural, but they lack clear relevancy to the current issue at hand."
