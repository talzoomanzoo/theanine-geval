Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. Neighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off. Neighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks? Neighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else. Neighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n2. Neighbor A and Neighbor B discuss organizing a community event to make a positive impact and appreciate the beauty of their city.\n3. Neighbor A has skills in manipulation and getting what they want.\n4. Neighbor A considers Neighbor B a great neighbor and wanted to do something special for them.\n5. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's gardening skills and wishes to have a green thumb.\n6. Neighbor B is against Neighbor A's idea, emphasizing the ethical and legal implications.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information about the past interactions between Neighbor A and Neighbor B. However, there is little direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT provided. The context involves Neighbor A's struggle with procrastination and potential solutions offered by Neighbor B, while the MEMORY mostly discusses unrelated topics like Neighbor A's skills, a community event, and gardening. Some memory sentences, such as Neighbor A's tendency to put things off, might indirectly highlight their procrastination, but there is no direct mention or development of these ideas in the memory that connects with the dialogue context. The memory lacks clear development, causality, or connections relevant to helping the language model generate a contextually appropriate response in this scenario. Thus, the helpfulness of the MEMORY for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT is limited."
