Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together. Neighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left? Neighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him. Neighbors B: That's not true, Neighbor A. You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are. Neighbors A: I just feel so lost right now. I don't know how to move on from this. Neighbors B: It's going to take time, but you will get through this. Do you want to talk about how you're feeling or do something to take your mind off of things? Neighbors A: Maybe both? I just feel so overwhelmed and I don't know what to do. Neighbors B: How about we go for a walk and you can talk to me about everything that's been on your mind?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n2. Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.\n3. Neighbor A finds solace in nature and believes that it helps in coping with their emotions.\n4. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have a close friendship and have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n5. Neighbors A and Neighbors B enjoy going for walks together, especially to the park.\n6. Neighbor A and Neighbor B are neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a good idea. Going for a walk in the park always helps clear my mind. Thank you for being there for me, Neighbor B.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides insights into the relationship between Neighbor A and Neighbor B, showing that they have a close friendship (Memory 4) and enjoy spending time together, particularly going for walks to the park (Memory 5). This aligns well with the suggestion at the end of the dialogue to go for a walk and talk. However, some sentences, like Memory 2 and Memory 3, introduce unrelated contexts, which might confuse the language model as they do not directly relate to the current situation of a breakup. Overall, the MEMORY provides some contextually relevant cues but could be more focused and structured to enhance helpfulness."
