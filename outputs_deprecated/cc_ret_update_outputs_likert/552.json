Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today? Classmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own. Classmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others. Classmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone. Classmates A: You're not a burden, don't worry. And I'm always here to help you out. Classmates B: I appreciate that, but I don't want to always rely on others. I want to be more independent. Classmates A: I get it. Maybe there are some small things you can do on your own to start feeling more independent?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as evidenced by their conversation about their respective experiences.\n2. Classmates B finds it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after a conversation they had about following dreams.\n3. Classmates A enjoys reminiscing about childhood memories, particularly about playing on swings and making music with friends.\n4. Classmates A and B are both keeping up with the homework in their math class.\n5. Classmates B is interested in learning to play an instrument.\n6. Classmates A finds pursuing music rewarding and is passionate about it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful context about the relationship between Classmates A and B, suggesting that they have a friendly and supportive relationship (Memory 1). This is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as it reflects the supportive nature of Classmate A in offering help and understanding Classmate B's feelings. Memory 2 and Memory 6 hint at Classmate A's passion for music, which, although not directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, could potentially be useful for generating future dialogues where hobbies and interests are discussed. Memory 5 about Classmate B's interest in learning to play an instrument, while interesting, does not directly contribute to understanding or responding to the immediate context of expressing frustration and seeking independence.\n\nThe rest of the memories (Memory 3 and Memory 4) don't contribute much to the context at hand. Memory 3's focus on childhood memories and Memory 4's reference to math homework are disconnected from the current dialogue topic of independence and emotions.\n\nOverall, while some sentences in the MEMORY provide relevant context for understanding the supportive relationship, the natural development of events specific to the dialogue context is not clearly demonstrated across all memories. Therefore, the score is a 3 as there is a mix of relevant and less relevant information."
