Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss! Co-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes. Co-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan. Co-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues.\n2. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.\n3. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's competence and effort in their work.\n4. Co-worker A strives to do their best in their work.\n5. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value communication and understanding in relationships.\n6. Co-worker A is seen as competent and reliable by Co-worker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives a sense of the professional relationship between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, showing mutual respect and appreciation for competence and a strong work ethic. This context is useful as it suggests that underlying tensions might arise from Co-worker A's authoritative approach, even though both parties recognize each other's strengths and value communication. The MEMORY is well-structured, with coherent and relevant information that can guide the generation of a suitable next response. However, it could be improved with more details or examples directly depicting the interactions or specific instances where these values play out, which is why it's not rated a 5."
