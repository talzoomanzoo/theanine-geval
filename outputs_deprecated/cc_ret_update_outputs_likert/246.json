Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend! Co-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang. Co-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while. Co-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n2. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together.\n3. Co-worker B is married and had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends.\n4. Co-worker A and Co-worker B used to work together at a clothing store.\n5. Co-worker A is observant and did some research on social media to find out that Co-worker B is married.\n6. Co-worker A and Co-worker B both plan to treat themselves to a nice dinner with their paychecks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I sang \"Amazing Grace.\" It felt really special to share that moment with everyone at church. It was a great experience.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY includes some background information on the relationship and past interactions between co-worker A and co-worker B, such as working together at a clothing store and sharing happy memories, which might slightly help understand the nature of their relationship. However, the majority of the MEMORY is not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about co-worker A's experience singing a solo at church. Details like co-worker B being married, their hiking trip, and the plan to treat themselves to a nice dinner with their paychecks do not provide useful context for generating a response to the current conversation about singing. Furthermore, the lack of strong connections or logically structured information relevant to the singing topic makes the MEMORY less helpful."
