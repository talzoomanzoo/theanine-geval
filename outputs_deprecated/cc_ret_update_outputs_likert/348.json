Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful. Co-workers B: Did you make sure to include all the necessary details? Co-workers A: Yes, I made sure to cover everything we talked about in the meeting. I even added some extra information that I thought could be useful. Co-workers B: That's smart thinking. It shows that you're invested in the company and want to make sure things run smoothly. Co-workers A: Thanks. I learned a lot from taking over the family business. It taught me the importance of being efficient and proactive. Co-workers B: I remember you telling me about that. It's amazing how much you've accomplished since then. Co-workers A: It's been a journey, but I'm glad to see the business flourishing. It gives me a sense of pride and accomplishment.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A took over their family's business a few years ago and it has improved since then.\n2. Co-worker B appreciates the pen and thanks Co-worker A for the gesture.\n3. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a thoughtful gesture.\n4. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value trust in their personal and professional relationships.\n5. Co-worker B finished a project and sent it to the manager for review.\n6. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a symbol of trust in their professional relationship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's truly inspiring to see how far you've come and the positive impact you've had on the business. Your dedication and hard work are definitely paying off.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers moderately helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 1 is particularly relevant as it aligns with Co-worker A's recount of their experience taking over the family business and the resulting sense of pride and accomplishment mentioned in the context. This information helps to understand Co-worker A's motivation and backstory, adding depth to the dialogue.\n\nSentences 3 and 6 mention Co-worker A giving Co-worker B a pen as a gesture, which is not directly related to the immediate context but could contribute to understanding the trust and goodwill between the two characters, supporting sentence 4 about the value of trust in relationships.\n\nHowever, sentences 2, 4, and 5 are less directly helpful. Sentence 2 and 3, while related to the pen, do not add much to the understanding of their current conversation about professionalism and growth. Sentence 5 about Co-worker B finishing a project is unrelated to the current dialogue.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY contains some useful context, not all of it is directly helpful for generating the next response, and some sentences offer little informative value or are loosely connected to the dialogue. Improvements could involve focusing more on the professional interactions and developments between the co-workers, similar to what was addressed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
