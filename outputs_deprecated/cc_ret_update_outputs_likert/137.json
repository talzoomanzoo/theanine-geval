Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly. Neighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A is excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends.\n2. Neighbors A enjoys living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B.\n3. Neighbors A appreciates having friendly faces around and hopes to make new friends soon.\n4. Neighbors B acknowledges Neighbors A's friendly and outgoing nature.\n5. Neighbors A just moved to a new neighborhood and is getting to know the area.\n6. Neighbors A found a park and a coffee shop nearby that they want to visit.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides limited helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context discusses a city visit, its architecture, cleanliness, and friendly people, and the conversation partner's interest in knowing which city it was. However, the MEMORY mostly revolves around Neighbors A's experiences and feelings related to their neighborhood, making friends, and exploring local amenities like a park and coffee shop, without any direct correlation to a city visit or providing information that would logically lead to responding to the question of which city was visited. The connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT are tenuous at best, as there is no apparent cause-effect or developmental link between the MEMORY entries and the current dialogue topic. While the sentences are naturally phrased, they lack relevancy to the ongoing discussion about a city visit, limiting their helpfulness."
