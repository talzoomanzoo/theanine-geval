Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A is stranded in space, running out of oxygen and feeling lightheaded.\n2. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during the difficult situation.\n3. Classmates B praised Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n4. Classmates A helped Classmates B out of friendship and believes in supporting each other.\n5. Classmates A and B have been on field trips to other planets or moons before, like Mars.\n6. Classmate A is patient and helpful in teaching driving material to Classmate B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Oh, no, I didn't get sunburned. I think I might be having an allergic reaction to something. I appreciate your concern, though.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provided is largely irrelevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The dialogue context pertains to Classmates A inquiring about Classmates B's red and splotchy face, suggesting a potential sunburn or other mundane issue. In contrast, the MEMORY contains information about experiences in space, support during difficult situations, field trips to other planets, and teaching driving material. These details do not offer any helpful or relevant information that would allow a language model to generate a proper response to the current dialogue context. There is a significant disconnect between the CONTEXT and MEMORY, and the MEMORY does not provide a structured development of past interactions relevant to the immediate discussion about a potentially sun-related issue."
