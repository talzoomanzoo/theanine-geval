Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today. Wife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that. Husband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you. Wife: You always go above and beyond, dear. Husband: It's the little things that count, right? Wife: Definitely. Speaking of little things, do you remember when you told me about catching the bus just in time a few months ago?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful.\n2. The wife is glad to see the husband finding a sense of purpose and being happy.\n3. The husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that make him happy outside of work and family life.\n4. The wife mentions that the husband had to run to catch the bus a couple of years ago.\n5. The husband enjoys being outside and loves the weather after being stuck indoors at work.\n6. The wife is supportive of her husband's hobbies and interests, such as playing the guitar.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I remember that! It was quite the rush, but I made it. It's those little victories that can really brighten up your day, you know?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY is partially helpful for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 1 is very relevant as it aligns with the current conversation about 'little things' that add up in life. Sentence 4 directly connects to the wife's mention of the husband catching the bus, which helps the model understand this context. However, the other sentences in the memory, while naturally phrased, do not directly contribute to the context of the dialogue about lights, coziness, or the specific memory of catching the bus. Sentences 2, 3, 5, and 6 provide a broader understanding of the dynamics and interests between the husband and wife, but they are not directly connected to the current dialogue. Overall, there is a mix of relevance and general information, leading to a mid-scale score."
