    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. Neighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off. Neighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks? Neighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else. Neighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location? Neighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home. Neighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become. Neighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice. Neighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along?  Neighbors A: It's finished! Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. It was a lot of work, but worth it in the end.  Neighbors B: That's amazing, thanks for building me such a beautiful house.  Neighbors A: Of course, I'm glad you like it. Remember when we watched the sunset over the London skyline? That was such a beautiful moment. Neighbors B: Yes, I still remember the pink and orange hues reflecting off the buildings. It was breathtaking. Neighbors A: Speaking of London, have you heard about those recent cases of identity theft? It's terrible that people like that exist. Neighbors B: Yes, it's scary to think someone could steal your identity and ruin your life like that. Neighbors A: Exactly, that's why I always try to be a kind person and help others when I can. Like arranging flowers in a vase, for example. Small acts of kindness can make a big difference. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A and Neighbor B discuss organizing a community event to make a positive impact and appreciate the beauty of their city.\n2. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n3. Neighbor A considers Neighbor B a great neighbor and wanted to do something special for them.\n4. Neighbors A values their friendship with Neighbors B, describing them as a great neighbor.\n5. Neighbors A and B value gratitude and being alive to witness incredible moments.\n6. Neighbors A had help from friends in building the new house.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's such a thoughtful gesture. It's true, small acts of kindness can really brighten someone's day. Just like how our community event brought everyone together and uplifted spirits. It's all about spreading positivity and making a difference, no matter how small.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information that could assist in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, memories about Neighbor A and Neighbor B discussing community events, considering each other great neighbors, and valuing incredible moments tie into the themes of gratitude and appreciation seen in the dialogue. However, the specific references in the context to the house project and the London sunset are not directly addressed in the MEMORY, which could make it less effective in guiding a language model to continue the conversation seamlessly. The MEMORY hints at a positive relationship and collaboration, which is relevant to their interactions, but lacks specific references to the ongoing conversation topics. Overall, it provides some context but could be more directly aligned with the precise details of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
