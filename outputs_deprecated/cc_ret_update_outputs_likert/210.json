    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax. Neighbors B: What kind of breathing exercise?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A is willing to take things slow in their relationship with Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbors A has developed romantic feelings for Neighbors B.\n3. Neighbor B reassures Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasizes their current friendship.\n4. Neighbor A and Neighbor B found a park together a couple of years ago and enjoyed playing frisbee and having a picnic.\n5. Neighbors A ordered pizza for Neighbors B in the past.\n6. Neighbors B values their friendship with Neighbors A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's a simple one where you inhale deeply for a count of four, hold it for seven, and then exhale slowly for eight. It's been surprisingly effective for calming me down.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about the relationship between Neighbors A and B, which could potentially inform the response generation. For example, points 1, 2, 3, and 6 give insights into their interpersonal dynamics, which might influence the tone and depth of the conversation. However, these memories do not directly relate to the current topic of breathing exercises, which is the main subject of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memories related to shared past activities (point 4) and acts of kindness (point 5) are naturally phrased and offer a background that can be useful for understanding the relationship context, but they lack direct relevance to the ongoing dialogue. Overall, while the MEMORY provides a sense of the speakers' relationship, it doesn't offer very specific support for generating the next immediate response about breathing exercises, resulting in a moderate score."
