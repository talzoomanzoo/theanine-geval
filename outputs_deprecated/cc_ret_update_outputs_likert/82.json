    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret? Neighbors B: Of course, what's up? Neighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door. Neighbors B: Oh, why are you hiding from her? Neighbors A: She wants me to go to a family dinner tonight, but I'm too tired and just want to relax at home. Neighbors B: Maybe you should talk to her about it and let her know how you feel. Neighbors A: I know, but I don't want to disappoint her. Neighbors B: It's important to take care of your own needs and speak up for yourself. Plus, maybe you can compromise and go to the dinner for a little while and then come back home to relax. Neighbors A: That's a good idea, thanks for the advice. Neighbors B: No problem. Speaking of compromise, remember that dinner we went to a few days ago? Neighbors A: Yes, it was so much fun! Neighbors B: I'm glad you enjoyed it. Maybe we can make it a regular thing and try out new restaurants together.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor B offers support and suggests planning a dinner to celebrate Neighbor A's new adventures in learning.\n2. Neighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation.\n3. Neighbors A enjoys trying new things, like new recipes.\n4. Neighbors B is open to trying new recipes and is excited to receive the chickpea curry recipe from Neighbors A.\n5. Neighbors A made a roasted vegetable and quinoa dish that Neighbors B enjoyed.\n6. Neighbors B is excited and supportive of Neighbors A's new ability.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! I'm always up for trying new places, especially after experimenting with different recipes at home. It could be a fun way to explore new cuisines and create more memories together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information about Neighbor A's cooking and the culinary interests of both neighbors, which is somewhat relatable to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT since it involves a discussion around attending dinners. However, it lacks direct correlation with the specific context mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about avoiding a family dinner and the potential compromise. MEMORY does not provide much helpful information for generating an appropriate response for the ongoing conversation, as it mainly revolves around cooking and recipes rather than feelings about family obligations. The past interactions documented in the MEMORY do not clearly support the current dialogue or demonstrate a natural development or causality between these events and the current conversation about dinner plans and compromise."
