Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind? Classmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you. Classmates B: Oh, really?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A discovered a secret that Classmates B has been keeping.\n2. Classmates A and B are students in the same class.\n3. Classmates A was worried about a situation but it turned out to be not a big deal.\n4. Classmates A and B are close and have a level of trust between them.\n5. Classmates A offered help and support to Classmates B.\n6. Classmates A and B have had a previous positive interaction in a coffee shop where Classmates A rubbed Classmates B's neck, providing relaxation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, it's nothing bad, don't worry. I just wanted to let you know that I'm here for you no matter what.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several helpful cues that can assist a language model in generating a relevant response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, the memories that Classmates A and B are in the same class (sentence 2), have a close relationship with a level of trust (sentence 4), and have had previous positive interactions (sentence 6) help to explain why Classmate A feels comfortable expressing personal thoughts towards Classmate B. This context helps in understanding the depth of their relationship, which is relevant to the conversation. The memories about previous interactions, such as offering help and support (sentence 5), and having positive interactions (sentence 6), further support the notion of a close and trusting relationship, which is pivotal when one classmate is expressing feelings.\n\nSentences about discovering a secret (sentence 1) or being worried about a situation (sentence 3) might not be directly relevant to the current dialogue context, but they don't detract from the overall helpfulness of the memory. They are phrased in a way that suggests neutral or positive development, which maintains coherence with the relationship context and does not confuse the language model. However, since not all information directly ties into generating a specific next response in this dialogue, it's rated slightly lower than perfect but still quite helpful."
