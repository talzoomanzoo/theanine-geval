    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway? Wife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go? Husband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city. Wife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change. Husband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think? Wife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it. Husband: Great. I'll start looking for rental cabins right away. I know this may sound impulsive, but I'm really excited to make this happen.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband is excited about his progress on long-awaited plans and is putting in a lot of effort to make them a reality.\n2. The husband is inspired by his wife to take action on his dreams and goals.\n3. The husband apologized and promised to involve the wife in his plans in the future.\n4. The husband and wife are committed to each other and excited about their future together.\n5. The husband values the wife's encouragement and positivity in his pursuit of his goals.\n6. The wife is supportive and proud of her husband for working towards his goals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some context related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the husband being excited about making plans (sentence 1) and the supportive nature of the wife's encouragement (sentence 5 and 6). However, the MEMORY does not explicitly address the specific context of the weekend getaway and the plans being discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Some of the statements in MEMORY, like sentence 3, do not clearly connect with the current dialogue and could confuse as they mention an apology and future involvement with plans, which is not part of the ongoing dialogue. The connections in MEMORY are a bit broad and not directly aligned with the immediate context of planning a weekend getaway, but they do provide a general sense of the couple's relationship dynamic, which is somewhat helpful."
