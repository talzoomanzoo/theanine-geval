Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today? Classmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own. Classmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others. Classmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone. Classmates A: You're not a burden, don't worry. And I'm always here to help you out.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as evidenced by their conversation about their respective experiences.\n2. Classmates A and B are both keeping up with the homework in their math class.\n3. Classmates B finds it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after a conversation they had about following dreams.\n4. Classmates A enjoys reminiscing about childhood memories, particularly about playing on swings and making music with friends.\n5. Classmates A finds pursuing music rewarding and is passionate about it.\n6. Classmates A and B enjoy jamming together and plan to collaborate on music in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks, that means a lot to me. I appreciate your support, and I'm grateful to have you by my side.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe memory contains a mix of information about the relationship between Classmates A and B and some details about their interests and activities. There are relevant points that contribute to understanding their supportive relationship, such as Sentence 1, which highlights their supportive dynamic, which is directly related to the dialogue context. However, the other sentences focus on aspects unrelated to the current conversation, such as their mutual interest in music and past experiences. While these details provide background about their friendship, they don't directly inform the dialogue context about Classmate Bâ€™s current feelings of frustration and dependency. Additionally, the memory is structured in a way that defines various aspects of their interactions, beneficial for contextual understanding but not directly helpful in generating an immediately relevant response in this context."
