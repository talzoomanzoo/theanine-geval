Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind? Classmates A: I know about your affair with that other woman. Classmates B: What are you talking about? I don't have an affair with anyone.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B have a good relationship, with Classmates A expressing admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor.\n2. Classmates A suggests grabbing lunch together, showing an interest in spending more time with Classmates B.\n3. Both Classmates A and B enjoy talking to each other and consider themselves great study partners.\n4. Both Classmates A and B are open to exploring a romantic connection and are looking forward to getting to know each other better.\n5. Classmates A and B are interested in biology and studying cells.\n6. Classmates A finds it refreshing to talk to someone genuinely interested in science and learning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context regarding the relationship between Classmates A and B. It establishes that they have a good relationship and enjoy spending time with each other, which could be relevant to the current dialogue about an alleged affair. The information about them being great study partners and their mutual interest in biology, although tangential, provides a broader understanding of their interactions. However, the MEMORY lacks specific details that directly connect to the current situation of the accusation of an affair, reducing its overall helpfulness in generating the next response. Additionally, the mention of a potential romantic connection is relevant, but it's not clearly developed to contextualize the accusation. Thus, while some sentences are useful, the MEMORY could be more directly aligned with the current conversation's focus."
