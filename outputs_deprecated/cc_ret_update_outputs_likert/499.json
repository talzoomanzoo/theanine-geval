    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria. Co-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking? Co-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you? Co-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A.\n2. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n3. Co-worker B points out that Co-worker A doesn't always consider how their actions can affect others.\n4. Co-workers A and B have worked together on a big story in the past.\n5. Co-worker A is trying to be more conscious of how their actions impact others and avoid causing problems for anyone else.\n6. Co-worker A appreciates Co-worker B's support and plans to perform in the final round of the competition.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Great, looking forward to it! It's nice to have lunch together and catch up.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information that may be indirectly helpful for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it is clear from the MEMORY that Co-worker B is generally supportive of Co-worker A (#1, #2), which aligns with B's positive response to A's lunch invitation in the dialogue. Also, MEMORY indicates a past working relationship on a big story (#4) which might help inform responses regarding workplace interactions. However, many sentences in MEMORY are not specifically pertinent to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT (e.g., Co-worker A's performance in a competition #6) and do not clearly demonstrate a development directly tied to the invitation for lunch. The MEMORY is somewhat helpful as it adds context about their working relationship and the supportive dynamic, but it lacks more specific or directly relevant sentences about the current interaction inviting for lunch. Thus, it lands in the middle of the scale."
