Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess. Classmates B: Wait, what? You cheated on your taxes? That's not okay. Classmates A: I know, I know. I was just really struggling financially and I thought I could get away with it. Classmates B: You can't just cheat and hope to never get caught. That's not how it works. Classmates A: Remember when we talked about me wanting to become a professional basketball player? Classmates B: Yeah, I remember. So, what does that have to do with cheating on your taxes? Classmates A: It's just that I feel like I keep hitting roadblocks in my life. Every time I try to move forward, something happens to set me back. It's really discouraging. Classmates B: I understand that it can be tough, but cheating isn't the answer. You have to keep working hard and doing the right thing, even when it's hard.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed.\n2. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to keep pushing themselves and not let doubts hold them back.\n3. Classmates A believes in hard work and dedication to achieve goals both in basketball and their job.\n4. Classmates A has a big dream of becoming a professional basketball player and works hard towards that goal.\n5. Classmate B reassures Classmate A that they are all in it together and offers help if needed.\n6. Classmate A is pursuing a dream of becoming a professional basketball player and is working at a grocery store to save up money for training.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I know you're right. I need to stay focused on my goal of becoming a professional basketball player and not let setbacks like this deter me. I appreciate your support and advice.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about Classmates A's aspirations and struggles, which are mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 4 and 6 align with Classmates A's goal of becoming a professional basketball player, which is directly related to their current feeling of hitting roadblocks. Additionally, there is some support and encouragement from Classmates B reflected in sentences 1, 2, and 5, which connects with Classmates B's advice in the dialogue. However, MEMORY lacks direct references to the tax cheating issue discussed in the context. Furthermore, some sentences could have been better structured to clearly demonstrate the progression of their interaction or causality, for instance, how Classmates B's encouragement in MEMORY relates to the issue of tax cheating discussed in the dialogue."
