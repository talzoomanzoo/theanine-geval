Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. Neighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n2. Neighbor A has skills in manipulation and getting what they want.\n3. Neighbors A values their friendship with Neighbors B, describing them as a great neighbor.\n4. Neighbor B is against Neighbor A's idea, emphasizing the ethical and legal implications.\n5. Neighbor A considers Neighbor B a great neighbor and wanted to do something special for them.\n6. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's gardening skills and wishes to have a green thumb.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Maybe you could try breaking down the project into smaller tasks to make it more manageable. That might help you focus better and get it done on time.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some useful information that could assist a language model in generating a relevant response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, information about Neighbor A valuing their friendship with Neighbor B (memory points 3 and 5) and Neighbor B admiring Neighbor A's gardening skills (memory point 6) can provide context about their personal dynamics, indicating a positive relationship. Memory points 1 and 4 demonstrating that Neighbor B influences Neighbor A's decisions positively, which could relate back to the context of procrastination and encouragement. However, the specifics about skills in manipulation (memory point 2) and ethical implications (memory point 4) don't seem directly related to the task or context of procrastination and focusing on a project. The sentences are phrased naturally, but the overall relevance to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT is moderate, hence a score of 3."
