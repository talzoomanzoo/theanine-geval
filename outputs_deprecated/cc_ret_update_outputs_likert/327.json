Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today? Co-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there? Co-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done. Co-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded. Co-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out. Co-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends? Co-workers A: Ugh, don't remind me. That was such a disaster. Co-workers B: It was definitely not one of your finest moments. But it's good to see that you're being responsible now and taking care of things like sending packages. Co-workers A: Thanks. I'm trying to be more responsible and reliable these days. Co-workers B: That's great to hear. It reminds me of the time when you were a great leader in your country. You were strong, determined, and made a positive impact. Co-workers A: Wow, that was a long time ago. But I appreciate the compliment. It's nice to be reminded of my successes. Co-workers B: Yeah, and even though you had some rough times in your personal life, like that painful breakup, you still managed to pick yourself up and move forward. Co-workers A: It wasn't easy, but I had to. And now I try to focus on the positive things in life, like sending packages without any issues.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides.\n2. Both co-workers show a supportive and caring attitude towards each other.\n3. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to give people a chance.\n4. Co-worker A believes their success as a leader was due to determination and strength of character.\n5. Co-worker A went through a painful breakup and finds it hard to trust people.\n6. Co-worker A has been successful in not being late to work for weeks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm really proud of how far you've come. It takes a lot of strength to overcome tough times and still strive to be the best version of yourself. Keep up the great work, and don't forget to give yourself credit for all the progress you've made.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides moderately helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Several aspects of MEMORY align with the current conversation:\n\n1. Sentence 1 is relevant, as Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible, which relates to the discussion about sending packages and being reliable.\n2. Sentence 2 reflects the supportive and caring attitude co-workers have towards each other, which is evident in the context as Co-worker B encourages and acknowledges Co-worker A's progress.\n3. Sentence 4 matches the discussion about Co-worker A's past success and determination as a leader, mentioned by Co-worker B.\n4. Sentence 5 aligns with the mention of Co-worker A's painful breakup, and their efforts to move forward.\n5. Sentence 3 and Sentence 6 don't seem directly relevant to the current context, but they are coherent and provide extra background on the relationship between coworkers without disrupting the context understanding.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY has useful and contextually appropriate information that supports understanding the development and interactions between the speakers, making it useful for generating future dialogue responses."
