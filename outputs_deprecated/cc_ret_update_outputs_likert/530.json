Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess. Classmates B: Wait, what? You cheated on your taxes? That's not okay. Classmates A: I know, I know. I was just really struggling financially and I thought I could get away with it. Classmates B: You can't just cheat and hope to never get caught. That's not how it works.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate B reassures Classmate A that they are all in it together and offers help if needed.\n2. Classmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed.\n3. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to keep pushing themselves and not let doubts hold them back.\n4. Classmate B advises Classmate A to take deep breaths, stay confident, and focus on delivery.\n5. Classmate A has tried practicing in front of others but still feels nervous.\n6. Classmates A sometimes doubts if they are good enough to make it to the professional level.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I understand that you were facing financial difficulties, but cheating is never the solution. It's important to address the issue in a legitimate way and seek help if needed.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY does contain some elements that might be loosely relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly in the sense that Classmate B has a supportive and advisory role towards Classmate A. This is evidenced by the themes of encouragement, focus, and reassurance throughout the memory. However, these points are not directly related to the specific situation being discussed in the contextâ€”cheating on taxes. The past interactions suggested in the MEMORY mostly revolve around general encouragement and support, which, while slightly relevant, lack the specificity needed to directly inform the current dialogue situation. Additionally, the memory doesn't clearly demonstrate the development, causality, or the relating events that led to the current situation. The lack of context-specific details results in the MEMORY not being particularly helpful for informing the language model about the critical nuances of the current dialogue scenario."
