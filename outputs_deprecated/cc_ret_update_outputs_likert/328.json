Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbors A is enjoying the different culture and exploring the city.\n3. Neighbors B is familiar with Neighbors A's dog and looking forward to playing with it again.\n4. Neighbors A mentions having back pain and needing a break.\n5. Neighbors B expresses concern for Neighbors A's back pain.\n6. Neighbor B is interested in chiropractic care after hearing about Neighbor A's positive experience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a mix of helpful and less relevant information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences about the support and friendship (sentence 1) and Neighbor B's concern for A's back pain (sentence 5) establish a positive relationship and caring dynamic, which can be beneficial for continuing the conversation in a friendly manner. Sentence 6 about chiropractic care might lead to a relevant topic if the conversation shifts towards health. However, sentences 2 and 3 about culture, city exploration, and the dog don't provide immediate assistance for replying to the general question \"how's it going?\" While they are well-structured, their relevance might be situational depending on subsequent dialogues. Overall, the memory gives a reasonable context of their relationship, but not all details are directly helpful for the given context."
