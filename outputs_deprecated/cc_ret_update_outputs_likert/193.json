Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager! Co-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n2. Co-worker B acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress.\n3. Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader.\n4. Co-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication.\n5. Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n6. Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a good amount of helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It outlines Co-worker A's personal growth, acknowledgment and support from Co-worker B, and Co-worker A's aspirations to be a leader. This context supplies the background needed to generate a response that reflects the promotion as a significant step towards A's leadership goals, which have been encouraged and supported by B. The memory is fairly naturally structured, demonstrating a progression from past aspirations to current achievements. However, there is some redundancy in how Co-worker A's leadership aspirations are presented, which slightly detracts from its potential helpfulness. Overall, it provides a solid foundational understanding for a language model to generate a well-informed and supportive response."
