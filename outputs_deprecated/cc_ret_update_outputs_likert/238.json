    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that. Neighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset? Neighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore. Neighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it? Neighbors A: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end job.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\n2. Neighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship as neighbors.\n3. Neighbors A is detail-oriented and strives for perfection.\n4. Neighbors A wants to rearrange their living room and Neighbors B has experience with rearranging furniture.\n5. Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received.\n6. Neighbors B values reciprocity and acknowledges the mutual help between them as neighbors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm sorry to hear that you're going through a tough time at work. Maybe it's time to consider looking for other opportunities that value your hard work and attention to detail. I'm here to help you in any way I can, whether it's with job hunting or just being a supportive neighbor.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about the relationship between Neighbors A and B, such as Neighbors B being supportive and understanding (sentence 1), and the positive relationship they share (sentence 2). This information is somewhat helpful in understanding the dynamics of their interaction in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, other sentences like 3, 4, 5, and 6, while naturally phrased, reference details that are not directly relevant to the current conversation about work frustration. These sentences describe general characteristics and shared experiences that aren't crucial for generating a next response to the immediate dialogue. Overall, MEMORY contains relevant information but lacks specific details directly connected to the work frustration issue discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
