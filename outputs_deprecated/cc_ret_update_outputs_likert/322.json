Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today? Co-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there? Co-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done. Co-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded. Co-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out. Co-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends? Co-workers A: Ugh, don't remind me. That was such a disaster. Co-workers B: It was definitely not one of your finest moments. But it's good to see that you're being responsible now and taking care of things like sending packages.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides.\n2. Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides.\n3. Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits.\n4. Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions.\n5. Co-worker A is trying to improve their punctuality and cut back on drinking.\n6. Co-worker A went through a painful breakup and finds it hard to trust people.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, I'm trying to be more responsible in all aspects of my life. It's a work in progress, but I'm getting there. Thanks for noticing the effort.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT to some extent. Sentences 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 offer insights into Co-worker A's past behavior and struggles with responsibility, which is connected to the dialogue about responsibly handling package mailing and Co-worker B's mention of a past incident where Co-worker A couldn't drive home. These details help in understanding the dynamics between Co-worker A and B, and they can also enrich the language model's capacity to generate a more contextually informed future response. However, sentence 6 about Co-worker A's breakup and trust issues does not seem relevant to the context of the conversation, making it less helpful. Despite this, the overall memory successfully sheds light on the changes in Co-worker A's behavior toward responsibility, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, hence the score of 4."
