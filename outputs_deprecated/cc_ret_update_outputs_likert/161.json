Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Thank you for finding my glasses for me, Mentor. I always seem to misplace them.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor acknowledges Mentee's achievements and provides ongoing support and guidance.\n2. Mentee admires Mentor's success and wants to learn from them.\n3. Mentor is proud of Mentee for making positive changes and taking control of their life.\n4. Mentor is willing to share their knowledge with Mentee and help them achieve their goals.\n5. The Mentor advises the Mentee to be gentle with themselves when they slip back into old patterns.\n6. Mentee wants to make a name for themselves in the industry and believes learning from Mentor will help them achieve that.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context regarding the relationship between the Mentor and Mentee, specifically highlighting the Mentor's supportive role and the Mentee's admiration and goals. These elements are helpful as they underline the nature of the interaction and respective roles, which could be useful for a language model in generating supportive or guiding responses. However, the MEMORY does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT of the misplaced glasses, and many sentences are more focused on general mentorship themes rather than specific past interactions or causality connected to the current dialogue. The connection between the MEMORY and the present situation isn't fully clear, and as such the MEMORY could make it harder for the language model to easily pinpoint salient supportive cues related to the specific context of misplacing and finding glasses. This limits its overall helpfulness."
