Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today. Wife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that. Husband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful.\n2. The husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that make him happy outside of work and family life.\n3. The wife is glad to see the husband finding a sense of purpose and being happy.\n4. The husband enjoys being outside and loves the weather after being stuck indoors at work.\n5. The husband feels happy and content being outside in the beautiful weather.\n6. The wife is supportive of her husband's hobbies and interests, such as playing the guitar.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate all the effort you put into making our home feel so inviting. It really does make a difference in creating a cozy atmosphere for us to relax in.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some insight into the relationship dynamics between the husband and wife, which may be useful in generating future dialogue and responses. It highlights mutual support (sentences 2 and 6) and shared sentiments about life's simple joys (sentence 1), which are somewhat relevant as they relate to the overall theme of creating a cozy and welcoming environment, as seen in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY also touches upon the husband's enjoyment of being outside and the mutual happiness between the husband and wife (sentences 3, 4, and 5). However, the connections between these memories are not strongly tied to the specific interaction occurring in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding hanging lights and creating a cozy atmosphere. While they provide some context on their relationship, the development and causality of events aren't explicitly connected to the current dialogue. Therefore, MEMORY scores a moderate helpfulness score of 3."
