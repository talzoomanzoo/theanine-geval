    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I can't believe how honored I am to be part of our class. I feel like we have something special going on here. Classmates B:  You're right. Our class definitely has a unique energy about it. What do you think sets us apart from other classes? Classmates A:  I think it's our sense of community. We all support each other and work together to achieve our goals.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B complimented Classmates A on their suit and brought up a past conversation about feelings.\n2. Classmate B feels relieved that they can still be friends with Classmate A.\n3. Classmates A values their friendship with Classmates B and looks forward to wearing a black suit to a wedding reception.\n4. Classmates A confessed their love for Classmates B, who does not feel the same way.\n5. Classmate A has been hiding their feelings for Classmate B and finally confesses to being in love with them.\n6. Classmate A is disappointed when Classmate B does not feel the same way.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I completely agree. The bond we share as classmates is truly special. It's amazing how we all come together to lift each other up and create such a positive environment.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains specific interactions and emotions between Classmate A and Classmate B, such as confession of love and friendship dynamics. However, these memories are not directly relevant or helpful to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about the positive energy and community spirit of their class. The MEMORY focuses primarily on a personal emotional storyline between the classmates, which does not aid in generating a continuation of the current discussion about class dynamics. The sentences in the MEMORY are somewhat naturally connected, but lack clear relevance to the ongoing conversation context. This reduces the helpfulness of the MEMORY in generating an appropriate response."
