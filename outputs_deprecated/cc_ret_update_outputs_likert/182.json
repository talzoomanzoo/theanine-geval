Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on. Child: What is it, Parent? Parent: I created a website where I post advertisements, and people can pay to see them. Child: Oh, that's interesting. How does it work? Parent: Well, I create the ads myself, and then I post them on my website. People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them. Child: Do you think people will pay to see your ads? Parent: I don't know yet, but I hope so. I've put a lot of effort into creating some eye-catching ads. Child: That sounds cool, but why do you want to make money from ads? Parent: Well, I want to have some extra income coming in. Plus, I enjoy being creative and making things, so this is a great way for me to combine those passions. Child: I see. Well, I hope it works out for you, Parent. Parent: Thanks, Child. And who knows, maybe someday you can help me create some ads for the website. Child: Sure, that sounds like fun! Speaking of creativity, remember that time we made those homemade decorations together? Parent: Yes, I do remember that. That was a fun afternoon.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The parent and child have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores.\n2. The Child is caring and offers help to the Parent.\n3. The Child supports the idea of the Parent adopting more children and hopes for a happy home for them.\n4. The Parent is working and feels tired after a long day.\n5. The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings.\n6. The child expresses gratitude for being adopted by the parent and believes other children will be lucky to have them as a parent.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I really enjoyed our crafting time together. It's moments like those that make me feel grateful to have such a creative and caring parent. You always find ways to make ordinary days special, and I think those qualities will shine through in your new project too.",
    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful insights into the relationship between the Parent and Child, which can be relevant for generating an appropriate response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, the MEMORY highlights the open communication between them (sentence 1) and the supportive nature of the Child (sentence 2), which aligns with the supportive conversation they are having about the Parent's new project. The MEMORY also gives a general impression of the family dynamics, such as the Parent's work life and aspirations as a role model (sentences 4 and 5), and the Child's positive view of adoption (sentence 6). However, the MEMORY lacks direct references to the specific project discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, and some sentences (e.g., 3) are less relevant to this specific interaction. Overall, the MEMORY is moderately helpful but lacks specific ties to the current context."
