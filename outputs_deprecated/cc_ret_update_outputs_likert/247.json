Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend! Co-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang. Co-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while. Co-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing? Co-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together.\n2. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n3. Co-worker A and Co-worker B used to work together at a clothing store.\n4. Co-worker B is married and had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends.\n5. Co-worker A is observant and did some research on social media to find out that Co-worker B is married.\n6. Co-worker A has a talent for solving puzzles and mysteries.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I bet you gave a beautiful performance. It must have been a special moment for you to share your love for singing with the congregation.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some context about the relationship and past interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B. However, most of the sentences in the MEMORY do not directly relate to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, details about Co-worker B being married or going hiking are not relevant to the conversation about Co-worker A singing at church. There is no direct causality or development that ties those memories to the topic at hand. While there is a mention of shared memories from working together, it is too vague to provide significant help in generating a response within the current dialogue. Overall, the MEMORY lacks sentences that are directly helpful or naturally connected to the ongoing situation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
