Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I can't believe how honored I am to be part of our class. I feel like we have something special going on here.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate B feels relieved that they can still be friends with Classmate A.\n2. Classmates B complimented Classmates A on their suit and brought up a past conversation about feelings.\n3. Classmate A has been hiding their feelings for Classmate B and finally confesses to being in love with them.\n4. Classmates A values their friendship with Classmates B and looks forward to wearing a black suit to a wedding reception.\n5. Classmates A confessed their love for Classmates B, who does not feel the same way.\n6. Classmates A has been busy with work and hanging out with friends, looking forward to the wedding as a fun night out.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some contextual information that can be pertinent to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it suggests a significant relationship dynamic between Classmate A and B, such as Classmate A confessing feelings and Classmate B's reaction (entries 3 and 5). This could contribute to understanding the feelings and motivations behind Classmate A's expression of honor in the dialogue. Additionally, there's mention of Classmate A looking forward to wearing a suit, which ties into the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Classmate A feels \"honored.\" However, some sentences, like those about Classmate A being busy with work and the wedding (entry 6), while indicating general context, do not directly relate to the concept of being honored. The MEMORY provides some helpful connections but could be more explicitly relevant or cohesive in relating directly to honor and the special nature of the class mentioned in the context."
