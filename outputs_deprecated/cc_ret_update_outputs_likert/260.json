Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend! Co-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang. Co-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while. Co-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing? Co-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites. Co-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice. Co-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it. Co-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent. Co-workers A: Thanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it. Co-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have a hobby like that. Reminds me of when you uncovered that mystery a while back. You always seem to surprise us with your skills. Co-workers A: Haha, yeah. I do like a good challenge. Speaking of surprises, remember when I found out you were married? That was a shocker. Co-workers B: Oh gosh, yes. I forget sometimes that not everyone knows. But yeah, I've been married for a few years now. Co-workers A: Crazy how time flies. Like when we found out Ms. Singh was leaving our school. I still can't believe that was two years ago. Co-workers B: I know, right? She was such a great teacher. Speaking of which, have you heard anything about her lately? Co-workers A: Not really. I think she moved to another state, but I'm not sure where. Co-workers B: Ah, okay. Well, hopefully she's doing well wherever she is. But hey, getting back to your solo, I think you should definitely do it again sometime. Co-workers A: Really? You think so? Co-workers B: Absolutely. You've got a gift, and it would be a shame not to use it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n2. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together.\n3. Co-worker A has a talent for solving puzzles and mysteries.\n4. Co-worker B is married and had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends.\n5. Co-worker A is observant and did some research on social media to find out that Co-worker B is married.\n6.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some useful elements related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it notes a past interaction where Co-worker A found out Co-worker B was married, which directly relates to a part of their conversation. Memory points 1 and 5 are relevant since Co-worker A expressly mentions being surprised about Co-worker B's marital status in the dialogue. Additionally, it highlights Co-worker A's skills in puzzle-solving (point 3), which aligns with Co-worker B's remarks about Co-worker A taking on challenges and their detective skills. However, the other points in MEMORY, such as Co-worker B going hiking and having dinner with friends (point 4), do not provide immediate relevance or significant context to the ongoing DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Points 2 and 6 serve to provide a background understanding of their relationship, but are somewhat generic (shared happy memories) or slightly off-topic (celebrating detective work), thus not directly essential for the dialogue at hand. Overall, the MEMORY could be more cohesive and directly relevant to the current conversation, which is why a score of 3 is appropriate."
