Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, have you checked out my new blog? It's all about promoting under-the-radar artists. Classmates B: I haven't had a chance to yet, but that sounds really cool! What inspired you to start it? Classmates A: Well, I've always had a passion for the arts, but I was too afraid to pursue it. I finally realized that it's what I really love, and I wanted to share that love with others. Classmates B: That's amazing. It takes a lot of courage to pursue your passions like that.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both Classmates A and B value the importance of trying new things and taking risks for personal development.\n2. Classmates A ended up taking Classmates B's advice and found success with it.\n3. Classmates A was initially hesitant about following Classmates B's advice.\n4. Classmates B expresses a desire to see Classmates A happy and successful in life.\n5. Classmates B gave advice to Classmates A in the past that paid off.\n6. Classmate B emphasizes the importance of positively impacting others while living a fulfilling life.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks! Your advice really helped me see that taking risks and following my passions can lead to something truly fulfilling. I couldn't have done it without your encouragement.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information that could be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, mainly in terms of the past interactions between Classmates A and B. It highlights that Classmate A took advice from Classmate B, which relates to their current conversation about Classmate A's blog and pursuit of passions. Additionally, it shows that both value taking risks and personal development, which connects to Classmate A's decision to start the blog.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY lacks specific details about the nature of the advice or how it impacted the blog creation, which would have made it more directly helpful. Moreover, some sentences, such as Classmate B emphasizing the importance of impacting others, don't clearly tie back to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences are somewhat connected but could be more directly related to the specific themes and developments in the current interaction. Thus, it provides moderate help but could be more detailed and specific to earn a higher score."
