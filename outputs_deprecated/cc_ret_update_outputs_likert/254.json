Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend! Co-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang. Co-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while. Co-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing? Co-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites. Co-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice. Co-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it. Co-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent. Co-workers A: Thanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it. Co-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have a hobby like that. Reminds me of when you uncovered that mystery a while back. You always seem to surprise us with your skills. Co-workers A: Haha, yeah. I do like a good challenge. Speaking of surprises, remember when I found out you were married? That was a shocker. Co-workers B: Oh gosh, yes. I forget sometimes that not everyone knows. But yeah, I've been married for a few years now.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n2. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together.\n3. Co-worker A is observant and did some research on social media to find out that Co-worker B is married.\n4. Co-worker A has a talent for solving puzzles and mysteries.\n5. Co-worker B is married and had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends.\n6. Co-worker A suggests celebrating their detective work with drinks after work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

It's nice to uncover little surprises about each other, keeps things interesting. How about we celebrate our detective skills with those drinks after work?",
    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT; however, the sentences could be more naturally connected to enhance the helpfulness. Sentence 1 directly correlates with the dialogue's mention of the surprise discovery of Co-worker B's marriage, but it lacks depth and specific contextual cues. Sentence 4, highlighting Co-worker A's talent for solving puzzles, ties into Co-worker B's comment about uncovering a mystery, which is somewhat relevant but not directly linked to the solo singing performance context. Sentence 5, which talks about Co-worker B's activities with friends, doesn't relate to the dialogue nor the discourse between the two coworkers. Sentence 6, suggesting a celebration, could provide more context about their relationship, but it isn't explicitly connected to the ongoing discussion. Overall, more coherence and depth could make MEMORY more beneficial for generating responses."
