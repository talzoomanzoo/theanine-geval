Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on. Child: What is it, Parent? Parent: I created a website where I post advertisements, and people can pay to see them. Child: Oh, that's interesting. How does it work? Parent: Well, I create the ads myself, and then I post them on my website. People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them. Child: Do you think people will pay to see your ads? Parent: I don't know yet, but I hope so. I've put a lot of effort into creating some eye-catching ads. Child: That sounds cool, but why do you want to make money from ads? Parent: Well, I want to have some extra income coming in. Plus, I enjoy being creative and making things, so this is a great way for me to combine those passions. Child: I see. Well, I hope it works out for you, Parent. Parent: Thanks, Child. And who knows, maybe someday you can help me create some ads for the website. Child: Sure, that sounds like fun! Speaking of creativity, remember that time we made those homemade decorations together? Parent: Yes, I do remember that. That was a fun afternoon. Child: It was! Maybe we can do that again someday.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The parent and child have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores.\n2. The Child supports the idea of the Parent adopting more children and hopes for a happy home for them.\n3. The Child is caring and offers help to the Parent.\n4. The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings.\n5. The Parent is working and feels tired after a long day.\n6. The Parent expresses a desire to adopt more children in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I would love that, Child. Your creativity and enthusiasm always brighten up my day. Let's definitely plan another crafty afternoon together soon.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the mutual support between Parent and Child and their history of working on creative projects together. However, most of the MEMORY focuses on topics that are not directly related to the current dialogue, such as the Parent's desire to adopt more children and their role model aspirations. While these points contribute to an understanding of their broader relationship, they do not specifically aid in generating the next response based on the immediate context of discussing the Parent's new advertising project. The MEMORY is phrased coherently, but a greater focus on information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT would enhance its helpfulness."
