Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water? Neighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for. Neighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit. Neighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water. Neighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it. Neighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again. Neighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower? Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A mentioned mowing the lawn with an old push mower, indicating they are responsible for the yard work.\n2. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n3. Both Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\n4. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n5. Neighbors A and B plan to work on mowing the lawn together next time to make it easier and possibly discover more things in common.\n6. Neighbors B agrees that mowing the lawn is a lot of work but acknowledges the exercise it provides.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It sure was! But I appreciate you suggesting having extra water on hand for next time. It's always nice to have a helping hand and some hydration while working on the lawn.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically referencing the shared past experience of mowing the lawn with an old push mower (points 1 and 6). This information is helpful because it shows a connection between Neighbors A and B as they reminisce about past events. However, some sentences, such as point 2 and point 3, are not directly relevant to the current context of the conversation, which focuses on their interaction by the pool and a past joke that went too far. Point 4 adds context regarding their long-term relationship, which can be contextually relevant, but it is somewhat generic. Point 5 mentions future plans to mow together, which is not discussed in the current dialogue context. Therefore, while MEMORY provides a mix of relevant and irrelevant information, it does so with natural phrasing, allowing the model to discern useful context. This places it in the middle range of helpfulness."
