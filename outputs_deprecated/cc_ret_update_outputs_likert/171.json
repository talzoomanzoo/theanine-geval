Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on. Child: What is it, Parent?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Child is caring and offers help to the Parent.\n2. The Parent is working and feels tired after a long day.\n3. The parent and child have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores.\n4. The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings.\n5. The Child offers to bring water or make soup for the Parent while they are resting.\n6. The Child supports the idea of the Parent adopting more children and hopes for a happy home for them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several pieces of helpful information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The points mentioned in the memory indicate a supportive and caring relationship between the Parent and Child. For example, point 1 directly highlights the Child's inclination to offer help, which could be relevant if the Parent wants to discuss collaboration on the new project. Point 3 suggests open communication, which sets the context for a dialogue where the Child might inquire more about the project. Additionally, point 4 hints at the Parent's aspiration to be a good role model, which might influence the tone or nature of the project. Points 5 and 6, while not directly related to the project, reinforce the supportive dynamic and possibilities for future topics in the dialogue. However, not all points are directly linked to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT or fully demonstrated in causality or development, hence a score of 4 rather than 5. Overall, the memory is phrased naturally and provides a relevant backdrop for the dialogue."
