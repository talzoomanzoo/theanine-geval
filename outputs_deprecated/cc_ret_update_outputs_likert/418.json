    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm really excited about finding a buyer for my product. I think it has a lot of potential. Neighbors B: That's great to hear, what kind of product is it? Neighbors A: It's a new type of workout equipment that's designed to be more efficient than traditional equipment. I've been working on it for months now and I really think it's going to take off. Neighbors B: Wow, that sounds interesting. Have you started looking for potential buyers? Neighbors A: Yes, I've been reaching out to various gyms and fitness centers to see if they'd be interested in carrying the product. I've even gotten some positive feedback from a few places. Neighbors B: That's awesome! I'm sure with your determination, you'll find the perfect buyer soon. Neighbors A: Thanks, I really appreciate your support. It's been a long road, but I'm confident that all my hard work will pay off. Neighbors B: Speaking of hard work, have you made any progress at your current job? I remember you were having some trouble with your boss. Neighbors A: Yeah, unfortunately things didn't work out and I was let go. But I'm trying to look at it as an opportunity to focus on my own business ventures.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B expresses a desire for Neighbors A to succeed and emphasizes the importance of treating others with respect and putting in effort at work.\n2. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's efforts to change and become a better version of themselves.\n3. Neighbors A is trying to improve their behavior at work and be a better colleague.\n4. Neighbors B appreciated Neighbors A's support during this difficult situation.\n5. Neighbors A and Neighbors B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as they enjoy having coffee and chatting together.\n6. Neighbors B suggests that Neighbors A's attitude and behavior at work may be the reason for their boss wanting to fire them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY provided is moderately helpful for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\nExplanation:\n1. The MEMORY highlights a significant aspect of the relationship between Neighbors A and B, emphasizing their supportive and friendly nature (sentences 2 and 5), which aligns with the supportive tone seen in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n2. Sentence 1 mentions Neighbors B's encouragement for Neighbors A's success, resonating well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbor A's business endeavors.\n3. Sentence 3 touches upon Neighbors A's efforts to improve their behavior at work, which ties into the discussion about Neighbors A's job situation.\n4. However, sentence 6 seems judgmental and out of sync with the supportive tone depicted elsewhere in the MEMORY and DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It could be potentially distracting for a language model seeking to generate an appropriately supportive continuation.\n5. The connections between the sentences could be clearer, and some memory sentences do not directly relate to the CONTEXT. \n\nOverall, while the MEMORY contains relevant themes and supportive aspects, its clarity and connection to the immediate CONTEXT could be improved for a higher score."
