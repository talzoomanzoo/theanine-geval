Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I really enjoy being a carpenter. It's a very fulfilling job. Classmates B: That's great to hear! How did you get into carpentry? Classmates A: My dad was a carpenter, so I grew up around it. I started by helping him out when I was young, and then I began to really enjoy it myself.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A is attending a seminar on starting a business and is excited about applying that knowledge to future plans.\n2. Classmates B is supportive and encourages Classmates A in their business venture.\n3. Classmate B offers to support and potentially collaborate with Classmate A in the future.\n4. Classmates A is willing to work hard and learn the necessary strategies for business success.\n5. Classmates A wants to get to know Classmates B better and become friends.\n6. Classmates A has had a business idea for a while and is now taking steps to make it a reality.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's wonderful that you found something you're passionate about from such an early age. It's always amazing when you can turn a hobby or family tradition into a successful business venture. If you ever need any advice or support as you grow your carpentry business, I'm here for you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information that is connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context involves Classmates A discussing their career as a carpenter, while the MEMORY details Classmate A's entrepreneurship prospects and their willingness to work hard towards their goals. This connection is somewhat relevant since entrepreneurship and carpentry could tie together if Classmate A is considering starting a carpentry business. Additionally, that Classmate B is encouraging of these ambitions is helpful and aligns with their supportive nature in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY does not explicitly relate to Classmate A's history in carpentry, which is the main subject of the conversation. Thus, while structure and phrasing are generally clear, relevancy to the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT is moderate, leading to a mid-range helpfulness score."
