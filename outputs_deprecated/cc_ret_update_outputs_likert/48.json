Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\n2. Co-worker A values their health to continue working at their best.\n3. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health.\n4. Co-worker A feels motivated about the future and is excited to work with Co-worker B.\n5. Co-workers A and B have a positive and optimistic attitude towards their future collaboration.\n6. Co-worker B was surprised to learn about Co-worker A's past struggles.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It outlines the supportive relationship between Co-workers A and B, noting that Co-worker B offers help and encourages prioritizing health, which is relevant to handling workload. The positive outlook on future collaboration and Co-worker A's motivation can influence the tone of the response. However, the specific connection between workload and past struggles isn't highlighted directly, though the mention of past struggles gives depth to the context of their interactions. The MEMORY is overall relevant, structured, and provides context, but could be slightly more directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT for a perfect score."
