Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today? Co-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing. Co-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed. Co-workers B: That's really nice of you, but I don't want to burden you with my work.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\n2. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health.\n3. Co-worker A values their health to continue working at their best.\n4. Both co-workers are looking forward to starting their partnership and are open to seeking extra help if needed.\n5. Co-worker A feels motivated about the future and is excited to work with Co-worker B.\n6. Co-worker B agrees that their skill sets complement each other well.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "**Helpfulness Score: 3**\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information about the relationship and interaction between Co-workers A and B. Several points from the MEMORY align with the supportive and collaborative tone present in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as:\n\n1. Co-worker B's general supportiveness towards Co-worker A (point 1), which complements the reciprocal gesture in the context of Co-worker A offering to help Co-worker B.\n2. The openness to seek extra help and the positive outlook in the partnership (point 4 and 5) hints at a collaborative work relationship atmosphere, reinforcing the dynamic we see in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n3. The complementing skill sets (point 6) could form a backdrop for why they might offer each other help as demonstrated in the context.\n\nHowever, not all points directly align with the immediate interaction in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, Co-worker B encouraging Co-worker A to prioritize health (point 2) and Co-worker A's motivation about the future (point 5) are less relevant to the immediate concern of workload management. These points are somewhat useful for establishing the nature of their relationship, but they don't directly inform the conversation flow. Therefore, there is some relevancy seen but the MEMORY could have been more focused or directly addressing the current interaction, making it not fully optimally structured for the context provided, hence the score of 3."
