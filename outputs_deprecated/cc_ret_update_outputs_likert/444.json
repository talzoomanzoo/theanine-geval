Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: It's great to have friends who can help each other out, isn't it? Neighbors B: Absolutely. It's a two-way street, and it's important to be there for each other. Neighbors A: I remember when I helped you move last year, and then you watched my cat when I went on vacation.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the suggestion.\n2. Neighbors B offered to help Neighbors A with the apology process.\n3. Both neighbors express the difficulty of not being able to adopt all the animals they see but appreciate those who do adopt and give them loving homes.\n4. Neighbors B emphasized the importance of apologizing to show care for the relationship.\n5. Neighbors A bought a necklace from Neighbors B's shop and loves it.\n6. Neighbors A was looking for a new necklace and stumbled upon Neighbors B's shop.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, that's what good neighbors are for - supporting each other in times of need. It's all about building a strong community where we can rely on each other.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY does not provide relevant information that would help generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around mutual helping experiences between neighbors, specifically related to moving and pet-sitting. However, the MEMORY includes unrelated topics such as buying a necklace, discussing the adoption of animals, and apologizing. These themes are not connected to the ongoing discussion about helping each other as neighbors, resulting in a lack of helpful contextual cues that demonstrate the development of their interactions. Additionally, these sentences do not naturally fit into the flow of the current conversation, making them less beneficial for generating a relevant response."
