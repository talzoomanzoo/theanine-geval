Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water? Neighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for. Neighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit. Neighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water. Neighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it. Neighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again. Neighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower? Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work. Neighbors A: It was. But it was also a good workout. Neighbors B: I prefer to work out indoors where there's air conditioning. Neighbors A: Ha, I remember when I took off my jacket and put my feet up in your armchair. It was so warm that day. Neighbors B: Yeah, that was a hot day. I'm glad you felt comfortable in my home though. Neighbors A: You know, I really enjoy spending time with you. I want to get to know you even better. Neighbors B: I feel the same way. We should plan something fun to do together.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\n2. Neighbor A enjoys spending time in Neighbor B's cozy home and wants to hang out more often.\n3. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n4. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n5. Neighbors A and B plan to work on mowing the lawn together next time to make it easier and possibly discover more things in common.\n6. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! Maybe we can work on mowing the lawn together next time and have a nice chat while we're at it. What do you think?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Memory points 1, 2, and 4 are useful as they summarize the interactions that relate directly to the context of the conversation, particularly their shared enjoyment of each other's company and spending time outdoors. These points help in understanding the dynamics between the two neighbors and set the groundwork for further interactions.\n\nHowever, the statements in MEMORY are not fully aligned with specifics from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, point 5 suggests they plan to mow the lawn together next time, which is not directly mentioned in the context. Similarly, point 6 about having extra water ready shows some consideration but isn't explicitly discussed in the dialogue. \n\nOverall, while MEMORY offers some valuable contextual cues, it could be improved with more alignment to specific dialogue events for a higher score."
