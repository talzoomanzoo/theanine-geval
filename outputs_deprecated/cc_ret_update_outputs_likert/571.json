    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. Neighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off. Neighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n2. Neighbor A and Neighbor B discuss organizing a community event to make a positive impact and appreciate the beauty of their city.\n3. Neighbor A has skills in manipulation and getting what they want.\n4. Neighbor A considers Neighbor B a great neighbor and wanted to do something special for them.\n5. Neighbor B is against Neighbor A's idea, emphasizing the ethical and legal implications.\n6. Neighbors A values their friendship with Neighbors B, describing them as a great neighbor.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains information about Neighbor A and Neighbor B's interactions, highlighting elements such as skills, friendship, and a community event. However, the information does not directly connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on Neighbors A's procrastination and potential strategies to overcome it. Most of the MEMORY sentences revolve around other aspects of their relationship, such as ethical considerations and Neighbor A's capabilities, which are not linked to the current conversation about project completion and procrastination. There is a lack of direct connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT that would make the MEMORY more beneficial for influencing the conversation towards actionable advice or understanding Neighbors A's procrastination challenges. Therefore, the MEMORY only moderately supports generating a coherent next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
