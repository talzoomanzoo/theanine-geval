Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends. Mentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections. Mentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here. Mentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people. Mentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering. Mentor: And remember, it's also important to keep in touch with your old friends. You can schedule video calls or even plan a visit back home. Mentee: That's true, I'll make sure to keep in touch. Thanks for the advice, Mentor. Mentor: Anytime, Mentee. Is there anything else you want to talk about or any updates you'd like to share?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n2. Mentee agreed to go back to the store to make things right and expressed gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n3. The Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process.\n4. Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process.\n5. Mentor advises Mentee to break down studying into manageable chunks, schedule study sessions and breaks, and use resources like practice exams and review books.\n6. The Mentee has been offered a job and has decided to take the job in the city.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY includes a few points that could conceptually be connected to the dialogue context, but lacks direct relevance to the specific conversation taking place. While there are general themes of advice, support, and adjusting to a new environment which are evident in both the MEMORY and DIALOGUE CONTEXT, the particular memories don't provide specific context that would directly aid in generating the next response. Statements about the college application process or a job offer in the city, as recorded in the memory, don't provide useful contextual cues related to the current issue of loneliness and making connections in a new city. The only potentially relevant memory is the first one about reassurance, but it doesn't specifically relate to forming new relationships or dealing with loneliness, limiting its direct applicability. Overall, the memories lack a direct connection to the conversation at hand, resulting in a lower score for helpfulness. "
