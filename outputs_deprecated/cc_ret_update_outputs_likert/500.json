Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria. Co-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking? Co-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you? Co-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you. Co-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n2. Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A.\n3. Co-worker B points out that Co-worker A doesn't always consider how their actions can affect others.\n4. Co-workers A and B have worked together on a big story in the past.\n5. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B acknowledge the importance of taking responsibility for their actions and learning from mistakes.\n6. Co-worker A is trying to be more conscious of how their actions impact others and avoid causing problems for anyone else.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The memory provides relevant and helpful information to inform the next response in the dialogue context. Sentences 1, 2, and 5 indicate a supportive and encouraging relationship between the co-workers, which correlates with the current positive interaction in the context. Sentence 3 highlights a connection to Co-worker A's past irresponsibility, which could be relevant to the question posed by Co-worker A in the dialogue context. Sentences 4 and 6 add depth to past co-worker interactions and demonstrate a development of events, such as working together on a big story and Co-worker A's attempt to change behavior, thus providing more context for the language model. However, the memory could be more specific or connected to the exact instance mentioned in the dialogue context, thus not achieving the maximum score."
