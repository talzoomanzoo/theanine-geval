Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss! Co-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes. Co-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan. Co-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway. Co-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues.\n2. Co-worker A strives to do their best in their work.\n3. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.\n4. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's competence and effort in their work.\n5. Co-worker A is seen as competent and reliable by Co-worker B.\n6. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value communication and understanding in relationships.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I get that you want things to run smoothly, but sometimes it's good to consider different perspectives and approaches. Teamwork and collaboration can lead to even better results.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful contextual information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Co-worker A's competence and Co-worker B's acknowledgment of Co-worker A's work ethic. These details can help understand the dynamics between the two co-workers and why Co-worker A insists on their way, as their past interactions involve successful collaboration and mutual respect. However, the MEMORY lacks direct references to the leadership aspect or potential conflicts, which are central to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the memory establishes a generally positive working relationship and common values (e.g. communication), it doesn't fully encompass the context of authority or differing opinions demonstrated in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Hence, the MEMORY's usefulness is moderate."
