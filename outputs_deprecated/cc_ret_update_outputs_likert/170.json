Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Child is caring and offers help to the Parent.\n2. The Parent is working and feels tired after a long day.\n3. The parent and child have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores.\n4. The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings.\n5. The Child supports the idea of the Parent adopting more children and hopes for a happy home for them.\n6. The Child offers to bring water or make soup for the Parent while they are resting.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several sentences that are relevant and helpful for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, sentences 1 and 6 are directly relevant because they describe the Child's supportive and caring nature towards the Parent, which is useful for generating a response to the Parent's statement about working on a new project. Sentence 2 indicates that the Parent is possibly tired, which ties into their dedication to work and could inform the Child's response. Sentence 3 and 4 provide background context about the Parent's role and aspirations, which might indirectly influence the Child's response. However, sentences 5 might be less relevant to the specific context of the new project but still maintain a natural phrasing. Overall, the MEMORY is structured coherently and provides enough contextual information to aid in generating a suitable response in this dialogue scenario."
