    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today. Classmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate B is interested in attending a new technology conference next month.\n2. Classmates B noticed Classmates A's improvement and acknowledged their hard work.\n3. Classmates B recalls a funny moment from high school involving Classmates A wearing pajamas to school.\n4. Classmates A's grades are looking good according to their teacher.\n5. Classmate B is working on finishing a history project.\n6. Classmates B is supportive of Classmates A's new relationship and believes they found someone who makes them happy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that is not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about an interesting talk attended by Classmates A. Most sentences in the MEMORY do not benefit generating a response to the current dialogue, as they discuss unrelated topics such as technology conferences, high school anecdotes, grades, and personal relationships. While some aspects may slightly contribute to understanding the dynamics between the classmates, they do not help directly with generating a response to the current topic about the talk Classmates A attended. The MEMORY lacks natural connections or development that align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
