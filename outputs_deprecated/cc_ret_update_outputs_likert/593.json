    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work. Wife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help. Husband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff. Wife: Nonsense! You can always come to me with anything. Plus, I enjoy helping you with your creative process. Have you also tried revisiting some of the writing prompts we did in our creative writing class? Husband: I have, but I feel like I'm just repeating the same stories over and over again. Wife: Maybe it's time to take a step back and try something new. Have you ever tried writing in a different genre or experimenting with different styles? Husband: That's a good idea. I guess I just haven't had the courage to step out of my comfort zone. Wife: Remember when you faced your fear of public speaking during your fifth-grade presentation? You can do this too. Sometimes, the biggest breakthroughs come from taking risks. Husband: You're right. Maybe it's time to try something completely different and see where it takes me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The wife reassures the husband that it's okay to be different and encourages him to embrace who he is.\n2. Wife suggests that husband should try using more modern language to be better understood.\n3. Husband agrees to try adapting to modern language for better communication with his wife.\n4. The wife remembers the husband being nervous before the presentation.\n5. The wife compares the situation to when the husband fell asleep during a movie she recommended, indicating past issues in their relationship.\n6. Wife brings up Sarah, the husband's previous partner, but husband says he hasn't thought about her much.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad you're open to trying new things. Remember, I'll always be here to support you, no matter what direction your writing takes. Just believe in yourself and your creativity, and you'll see amazing results.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some elements that could be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the mention of the husband's nervousness before a presentation (which ties into the wife's suggestion to step out of one's comfort zone) and the wife's encouragement to embrace individuality, although these are not directly addressed in the context provided. However, much of the MEMORY contains information that doesn't directly help with generating a continuation of the current dialogue, such as discussions about modern language, a past partner, and falling asleep during a movie. These details don't appear relevant to the discussion of creativity and taking risks in writing. Therefore, the MEMORY offers limited helpful information connected to the current dialogue while including detailed aspects that are not very connected, earning it a low score."
