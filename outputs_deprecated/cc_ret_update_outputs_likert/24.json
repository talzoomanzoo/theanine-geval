Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water? Neighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for. Neighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit. Neighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water. Neighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n2. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n3. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n4. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n5. Both Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\n6. Neighbor A's mom scolds them for ripping off the tag from their new shirt.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some relevant context about the relationship and past interactions between Neighbor A and Neighbor B, which can be helpful to inform the language model's next response. Sentences 2 and 3 suggest a history of interaction and consideration for each other, which could be useful in understanding the dynamics between the speakers in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY could be more directly helpful if it included more specific instances or examples related to emotional interactions or previous conflicts, as in the current context.\n\nSentences like 1 and 3 indicate general goodwill and supportiveness, while sentences 4 and 5 give a casual look at their shared interests but do not directly pertain to the context of having been pushed into cold water. Sentence 6 seems particularly out of place and less relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as it doesn't relate well to the current scenario of the fight between the neighbors.\n\nOverall, while MEMORY offers a glimpse into the characters' past interactions, the helpfulness in generating a response for the current hostile interaction is limited. A score of 3 reflects this middle ground."
