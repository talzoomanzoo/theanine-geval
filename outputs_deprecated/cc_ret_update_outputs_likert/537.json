Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, check out this spot I found to camp out for the night. It's perfect!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate A and Classmate B are classmates who attended a party together.\n2. Classmate A is concerned about the party being discovered and getting in trouble with the school.\n3. Classmates B finds Classmates A's involvement in the community admirable and important.\n4. Classmate A expresses a desire to find alternative ways to have fun and make a positive impact in the community.\n5. Classmates A is proactive and curious, taking the initiative to research topics of interest.\n6. Classmate A agrees to take better care of themselves in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That looks amazing! I love how you're always discovering new ways to have fun and connect with nature.",
    "prediction": "4\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly in demonstrating Classmate A's proactive and curious nature (point 5), which aligns with them finding a perfect camping spot. The MEMORY also suggests a past context where Classmate A has been looking for alternative ways to have fun (point 4), which could relate to camping. Furthermore, there is a hint of caution in Classmate A's behavior regarding getting in trouble (point 2), which might influence the camping decision. However, the connection between the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT isn't very strong, as the direct relevance of most points is not clear. Therefore, it provides some help in generating a response but is not fully integrated or highly connected."
