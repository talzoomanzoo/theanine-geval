Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today. Classmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about? Classmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held. Classmates B: Wow, that does sound interesting. Did you take any notes? Classmates A: Yes, I took lots of notes. I'm excited to study this topic more on my own time. Classmates B: That's awesome. It's great to see your enthusiasm for learning. Classmates A: Thanks. I've always been passionate about learning new things. Remember when we talked about how determined I was to get into college? Classmates B: Yeah, I remember. You were always studying and taking extra classes. Classmates A: And now, after all that hard work, I am actually in college. It just goes to show that with dedication, you can achieve your goals.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A struggled with motivation but found a way to stay focused by thinking about the payoff of their hard work.\n2. Classmates B noticed Classmates A's improvement and acknowledged their hard work.\n3. Classmates A had a moment of frustration in the past but has learned to channel that energy into studies.\n4. Classmates A is willing to work hard to achieve their dreams.\n5. Classmates A is determined to make the relationship work, similar to their determination to get into college.\n6. Classmates A's grades are looking good according to their teacher.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that adds context to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, the details in MEMORY about Classmates A's determination and previous struggles with motivation (sentences 1, 2, 3, 4) are connected to the narrative of Classmates A's journey toward college (discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT). These memories aid the language model in better understanding the character traits and background of Classmates A, helping to generate a more informed and coherent next response. However, sentences 5 and 6 are less directly relevant to the current dialogue about learning and achieving educational goals, thus slightly reducing the overall helpfulness. Despite that, the MEMORY is mostly articulated well and connected logically, enhancing its helpfulness."
