Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message. Co-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident. Co-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows. Co-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive. Co-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right. Co-workers B: Speaking of convincing people, have you ever been in a physical altercation before? Co-workers A: Yes, unfortunately. But that doesn't mean I'm a danger to people. I just don't back down from a fight when I'm standing up for what's right. Co-workers B: That's understandable. Speaking of standing up for what's right, do you remember when you asked Karen for money and she was hesitant at first?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs.\n2. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument.\n3. Co-worker A has experience dealing with challenging clients and emphasizes the importance of communication and setting expectations.\n4. Co-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\n5. Co-worker A believes their evidence is more compelling than the opposing side's evidence.\n6. Co-worker B mentions that Co-worker A's reputation may have influenced Karen's hesitation to give them money.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I remember that. I believe Karen's hesitation was influenced by my reputation and the misconceptions some people have about me. It's important to always communicate openly and honestly to clear up any misunderstandings.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could assist a language model in generating a response for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Certain points, such as Co-worker B commending Co-worker A's courage to stand up and defend their beliefs, relates well to the ongoing theme of persuasion and conviction in the dialogue. Additionally, the mention of Co-worker A collecting evidence for a case and being confident in their argument connects with the dialogue's discussion on presenting compelling arguments. However, some events such as dealing with challenging clients and setting expectations, while naturally phrased, don't offer much relevance to the specific dialogue context. Lastly, the mention of Co-worker A's reputation influencing Karen's hesitation is relevant but can be made more straightforwardly connected to their past interaction. Overall, while MEMORY contains useful cues, not all entries have clear connectivity or direct relevance to enhance dialogue generation significantly."
