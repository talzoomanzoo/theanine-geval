Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate B reassures Classmate A that they are all in it together and offers help if needed.\n2. Classmate A has tried practicing in front of others but still feels nervous.\n3. Classmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed.\n4. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to keep pushing themselves and not let doubts hold them back.\n5. Classmates A sometimes doubts if they are good enough to make it to the professional level.\n6. Classmate B brought goods to Classmate A's house and is supportive of their basketball dream.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several statements that indicate past interactions between Classmate A and Classmate B, which revolve around support, confidence-building, and pursuing goals. However, these pieces of information do not directly relate to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Classmate A getting caught cheating on taxes. The MEMORY does not provide specific contextual cues or relevant development that could aid in generating a coherent response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the statements in MEMORY are somewhat naturally connected concerning mutual support and encouragement, their relevance to the present situation is minimal."
