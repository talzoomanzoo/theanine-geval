Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins. Neighbors B: Oh, okay. I didn't realize there was any confusion about that. Neighbors A: Well, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page. I don't want any misunderstandings in the future. Neighbors B: I understand. Is there anything else we should do to make sure we're clear about this? Neighbors A: I don't think so, but if you have any other suggestions, I'm open to hearing them. Neighbors B: No, I think the line is a good idea. It's clear and simple. Neighbors A: Great. Hey, speaking of lines and boundaries, remember when we talked about my promotion at work? I had to set some clear boundaries with my team about what I expected from them. Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember. How did that go? Neighbors A: It was tough at first, but eventually, everyone respected the boundaries I set and our team was more productive because of it. Neighbors B: That's great to hear. It's important to set boundaries and stick to them if you want to be successful in any area of your life. Neighbors A: Absolutely. And hey, on a related note, I wanted to talk to you about something else. Lately, I've been feeling really overwhelmed and stressed out. Neighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A is feeling overwhelmed and stressed, mentioning having a lot on their plate.\n2. Neighbors B offers to be more supportive and check in on Neighbors A more often.\n3. Neighbors A offers to help Neighbors B with getting into a workout routine.\n4. Neighbors B was read to from a book about personal development by Neighbors A, which had a positive impact on Neighbors A's career growth.\n5. Both neighbors emphasize the importance of taking care of each other as neighbors.\n6. Neighbors A believes in setting goals, developing a positive attitude, and taking action for personal development and career advancement.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes several points that are relevant to the ongoing conversation, such as Neighbors A feeling overwhelmed and stressed (Memory 1), which directly ties into the current discussion. It also reflects on past support Neighbors B offered to Neighbors A (Memory 2), which could be relevant in the context of offering help. Furthermore, it highlights shared values like personal development and mutual support (Memories 4-6), as well as aspects of their shared interactions, such as A's influence on B's career growth and their mutual goal-setting attitudes. These elements provide a comprehensive view of their relationship and past interactions, making it easier for a language model to generate responses that align with their history and current context. However, not all points in memory directly relate to the current conversation flow, which precludes a perfect score."
