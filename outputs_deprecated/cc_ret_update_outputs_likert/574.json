    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. Neighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off. Neighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks? Neighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else. Neighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location? Neighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n2. Neighbor A and Neighbor B discuss organizing a community event to make a positive impact and appreciate the beauty of their city.\n3. Neighbor A considers Neighbor B a great neighbor and wanted to do something special for them.\n4. Neighbor A has skills in manipulation and getting what they want.\n5. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's gardening skills and wishes to have a green thumb.\n6. Neighbor B is against Neighbor A's idea, emphasizing the ethical and legal implications.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That might help you stay on track and away from distractions. Plus, a new environment can sometimes boost productivity. Good luck with your project at the library!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided is not helpful in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around Neighbor A's struggles with procrastination and finding ways to focus on a project, while the MEMORY contains information unrelated to this topic. It discusses unrelated aspects such as skills for good or evil, community events, appreciation of gardening skills, and ethical implications of certain ideas. The MEMORY does not provide any cues or relevant information that would aid in continuing the conversation about procrastination or productivity. Additionally, the sentences do not demonstrate a clear development, causality, or relevancy to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it difficult for the language model to derive useful context for generating a response."
