Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. Neighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off. Neighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks? Neighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else. Neighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location? Neighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home. Neighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n2. Neighbor A and Neighbor B discuss organizing a community event to make a positive impact and appreciate the beauty of their city.\n3. Neighbor B is against Neighbor A's idea, emphasizing the ethical and legal implications.\n4. Neighbor A considers Neighbor B a great neighbor and wanted to do something special for them.\n5. Neighbors A enjoys taking care of flowers and finds it calming.\n6. Neighbor A has skills in manipulation and getting what they want.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provided does not offer relevant or helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around procrastination and strategies to overcome it, including changing location for better focus. However, the MEMORY entries focus on unrelated topics such as Neighbor A using their skills for good, organizing a community event, ethical considerations, appreciation of Neighbor B, taking care of flowers, and having skills in manipulation. These points do not connect with or develop the current conversation about productivity and overcoming procrastination. The MEMORY lacks relevant contextual cues, and the unrelated sentences are structured in a way that does not aid in understanding past interactions related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
