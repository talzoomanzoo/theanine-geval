Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today? Co-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing. Co-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\n2. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health.\n3. Co-worker A values their health to continue working at their best.\n4. Both co-workers are looking forward to starting their partnership and are open to seeking extra help if needed.\n5. Co-worker A feels motivated about the future and is excited to work with Co-worker B.\n6. Co-worker B agrees that their skill sets complement each other well.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about Co-worker A and Co-worker B's relationship, particularly in terms of support and teamwork. Sentences 1, 2, and 4 are somewhat relevant as they show a history of offering support and openness to help, tying into the current offer of help in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the precise details of past interactions specific to workload or current tasks are not explicitly mentioned, limiting their direct impact on generating an immediate next response. Nevertheless, the MEMORY suggests a generally positive and cooperative relationship, which can be useful for guiding the response tone. The MEMORY is well-structured but could be more tightly connected to the immediate context of workload and managing tasks."
