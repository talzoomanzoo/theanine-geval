Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A is known for being competent and is trusted with important projects.\n2. Co-worker A enjoys helping others and takes pride in their work.\n3. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.\n4. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's competence and effort in their work.\n5. Co-worker A strives to do their best in their work.\n6. Co-worker A is seen as competent and reliable by Co-worker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides several insights into the interaction between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, which can aid in the generation of a suitable response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It depicts Co-worker A as a competent and reliable individual, which aligns with the statement, \"I'm the boss!\" It reflects that Co-worker A is valued and trusted with significant responsibilities, underscoring their authority and ability, which may contribute to their positioning or mindset as a \"boss.\" Co-worker B's acknowledgment of Co-worker A's competence and work ethic strengthens this perception, highlighting mutual respect in their professional relationship.\n\nHowever, while the MEMORY provides useful context, it might benefit from additional information that directly connects the statement \"I'm the boss!\" to perhaps a specific instance or event where Co-worker A's leadership is exemplified. Nonetheless, overall, the MEMORY is well-structured, demonstrating clear professional interactions and sentiments that elevate the given context. As a result, it effectively aids a language model in framing relevant and contextually coherent responses."
