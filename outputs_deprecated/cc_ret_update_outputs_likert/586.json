Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work. Wife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Wife suggests that husband should try using more modern language to be better understood.\n2. Wife brings up Sarah, the husband's previous partner, but husband says he hasn't thought about her much.\n3. Husband agrees to try adapting to modern language for better communication with his wife.\n4. The wife compares the situation to when the husband fell asleep during a movie she recommended, indicating past issues in their relationship.\n5. The wife remembers the husband being nervous before the presentation.\n6. The wife reassures the husband that it's okay to be different and encourages him to embrace who he is.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a good idea. Maybe sharing my thoughts with you can spark some new ideas.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences such as \"Wife suggests that husband should try using more modern language to be better understood\" and \"Husband agrees to try adapting to modern language for better communication with his wife\" show the ongoing discussion about language and communication, which is pertinent to the husband's current struggle with writing. The wife's suggestion to brainstorm together aligns with this theme. However, other sentences like bringing up \"Sarah, the husband's previous partner\" and the comparison to \"when the husband fell asleep during a movie\" are less relevant or not as directly connected to the immediate context of writing struggles. Overall, the MEMORY would benefit the model to some extent, but it includes several points that are not directly useful in generating a response to the current dialogue."
