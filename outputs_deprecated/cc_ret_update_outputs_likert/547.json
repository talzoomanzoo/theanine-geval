Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today? Classmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as evidenced by their conversation about their respective experiences.\n2. Classmates A and B are both keeping up with the homework in their math class.\n3. Classmates B is interested in learning to play an instrument.\n4. Classmates B finds it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after a conversation they had about following dreams.\n5. Classmates A enjoys reminiscing about childhood memories, particularly about playing on swings and making music with friends.\n6. Classmates A and B enjoy jamming together and plan to collaborate on music in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Don't worry, I understand how you feel. Remember, you're not alone in this. We make a great team, and we can support each other in learning new things.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some context about the relationship between Classmates A and B, noting their supportive relationship (1) and shared interests in music (6). However, most of the entries do not have a clear connection or direct relevancy to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Classmate B expresses frustration about not being able to do things independently. While MEMORY does inform about the dynamics and some shared interests, it doesn't offer substantial help in crafting a response that addresses Classmate B's feelings of frustration or independence as expressed in the dialogue. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it included prior interactions or discussions that directly relate to B’s frustration or A’s previous support or advice."
