Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess. Classmates B: Wait, what? You cheated on your taxes? That's not okay. Classmates A: I know, I know. I was just really struggling financially and I thought I could get away with it. Classmates B: You can't just cheat and hope to never get caught. That's not how it works. Classmates A: Remember when we talked about me wanting to become a professional basketball player? Classmates B: Yeah, I remember. So, what does that have to do with cheating on your taxes? Classmates A: It's just that I feel like I keep hitting roadblocks in my life. Every time I try to move forward, something happens to set me back. It's really discouraging. Classmates B: I understand that it can be tough, but cheating isn't the answer. You have to keep working hard and doing the right thing, even when it's hard. Classmates A: On a completely different note, do you remember when I got a job at the local grocery store?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed.\n2. Classmate A is pursuing a dream of becoming a professional basketball player and is working at a grocery store to save up money for training.\n3. Classmates A believes in hard work and dedication to achieve goals both in basketball and their job.\n4. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to keep pushing themselves and not let doubts hold them back.\n5. Classmates A has a big dream of becoming a professional basketball player and works hard towards that goal.\n6. Classmate B reassures Classmate A that they are all in it together and offers help if needed.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Of course, I remember! You were so excited about that job and how it would help you save up for your basketball training. It's great to see you putting in the effort and dedication towards your goals. Just keep focused on your dream, believe in yourself, and don't let setbacks like this tax issue discourage you. Remember, we're all here to support you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant context for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT in terms of Classmate A's aspirations to become a professional basketball player and their job at a grocery store. These details help to illuminate the struggles Classmate A is facing, which is relevant to the conversation about tax cheating as a result of financial hardship and hitting roadblocks. Sentences 2 and 5 in the MEMORY clearly support the context of Classmate A's dreams and struggles, which are mentioned directly in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, sentence 4 aligns with the ongoing advice Classmate B provides to Classmate A in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about perseverance. However, some sentences in MEMORY, such as sentences 1, 3, and 6, while cohesive, are not as directly related to the specific issue of cheating on taxes discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, MEMORY provides a supportive backdrop and some helpful insights into the conversation but could be more cohesive and tighter in connecting directly to the present discussion points."
