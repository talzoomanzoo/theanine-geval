Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm really excited about finding a buyer for my product. I think it has a lot of potential.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B expresses a desire for Neighbors A to succeed and emphasizes the importance of treating others with respect and putting in effort at work.\n2. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's efforts to change and become a better version of themselves.\n3. Neighbors B appreciated Neighbors A's support during this difficult situation.\n4. Neighbors A and Neighbors B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as they enjoy having coffee and chatting together.\n5. Neighbors A is trying to improve their behavior at work and be a better colleague.\n6. Neighbors A suggested the possibility of dog-napping in the area.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fantastic to hear! I believe in your abilities and hard work. Remember to treat your customers with respect and provide excellent service. Your dedication will surely lead to success.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clarifies that Neighbors A and B have a supportive relationship (Points 1, 2, 3, and 4), which can guide how the language model might generate responses with a positive, supportive tone. Point 5, while not directly related to selling a product, gives additional context about Neighbors A's character and their attempts to improve at work, which might relate subtly to their motivation in finding a buyer. However, Point 6 regarding the suggestion of dog-napping seems irrelevant and does not naturally connect to the current dialogue about finding a buyer. Overall, while the MEMORY provides some helpful context for understanding the relationship between the neighbors, the connection to the specific enthusiasm about finding a buyer is limited."
