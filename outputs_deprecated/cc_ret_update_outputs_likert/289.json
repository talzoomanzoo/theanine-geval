Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn. Teacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation? Student: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle. Teacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time? Student: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then. Teacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going? Student: It's going pretty well. I started with French, but now I'm considering taking up Spanish and German too. I want to become more well-rounded. Teacher: That's a great goal. Have you thought about any specific ways you could use your language skills?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The student is studying French at college and plans on learning Spanish and German as well.\n2. The teacher speaks Spanish and French fluently.\n3. The teacher and student have a positive and understanding relationship.\n4. The student mentioned feeling stressed lately, which may have led to the outburst.\n5. The student believes in the importance of continuous learning and growth.\n6. The teacher advises the student on effective communication and problem-solving, emphasizing the importance of talking calmly and finding solutions together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I was thinking of maybe traveling to different countries and immersing myself in the language and culture. It would be a great way to practice and really understand the languages.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains several relevant and helpful pieces of information for generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. Sentence 1 is directly relevant as it captures the student's intent to learn multiple languages, which aligns with their stated goal in the dialogue of expanding their language skills. \n2. Sentence 2 provides useful context about the teacher's language proficiency, suggesting that the teacher could offer guidance or tips, which could be integrated into the conversation about language learning. \n3. Sentence 3 establishes the positive relationship between the teacher and student, which supports the friendly and encouraging tone evident in the dialogue. \n4. Sentence 5 aligns with the student's goal of becoming more well-rounded, providing context for the dialogue about continuous learning and personal growth. \n\nSentence 4 is less related to the current dialogue but isn't structuring a barrier to understanding, while Sentence 6 gives some foundation for the teacher's supportive role in the student's academic journey, even though the specifics are not mentioned in this particular context.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides information relevant to the dialogue and maintains a clear and natural structure, making it helpful for generating an appropriate response."
