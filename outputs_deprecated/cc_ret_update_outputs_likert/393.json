Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway? Wife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go? Husband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city. Wife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change. Husband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think? Wife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it. Husband: Great. I'll start looking for rental cabins right away. I know this may sound impulsive, but I'm really excited to make this happen. Wife: Don't worry, husband, it's not impulsive. You always follow through with your plans, and I believe this will be a wonderful experience for both of us. Husband: Thank you, wife. And, I want to apologize for the time I left without waiting for you. I know I promised to wait, and I should have kept my word. Wife: It's okay, husband. I understand that you were in a hurry, and it wasn't intentional. Besides, that was a long time ago, and we've moved past it. Husband: Thank you for being so understanding, wife. I just want to make sure I am not repeating the same mistake again. Wife: I trust that you won't, husband. And hey, remember when I stopped a runaway carriage from causing harm to a group of people? That was quite the adrenaline rush!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband apologized and promised to involve the wife in his plans in the future.\n2. The husband acknowledges his mistake, apologizes, and promises to make it up to his wife, emphasizing the importance of keeping promises and taking action.\n3. The husband is inspired by his wife to take action on his dreams and goals.\n4. The wife brings up past disappointment when the husband left without her, breaking a promise to wait for her.\n5. The husband is excited about his progress on long-awaited plans and is putting in a lot of effort to make them a reality.\n6. The husband acknowledges his wife's bravery and selflessness.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Wow, wife, that was truly remarkable! Your bravery and quick thinking never cease to amaze me. I'm so lucky to have you by my side.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information that the language model, in the role of the husband, can use to generate relevant and coherent responses based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences in MEMORY summarize past interactions between the husband and wife, highlighting important themes such as apologies, promises, taking action on plans, and acknowledging bravery. This background information can guide the model in understanding the couple's relationship dynamics and help craft appropriate responses in line with previous interactions. However, not all sentences align perfectly with the dialogue context, and some may not be directly applicable to the immediate situation, which is why the score is not a perfect 5. The information is generally structured well and provides a good contextual foundation."
