Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss! Co-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes. Co-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan. Co-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway. Co-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way. Co-workers B: And sometimes it is, but we all have different ideas and perspectives to bring to the table. Co-workers A: Okay, I see your point. I'll try to be more open-minded in the future. Co-workers B: That's all we can ask for. Remember that we're a team and we all have something valuable to contribute. Co-workers A: You're right. I'm glad we can have these conversations and work towards being better together.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues.\n2. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value communication and understanding in relationships.\n3. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.\n4. Co-worker A strives to do their best in their work.\n5. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B enjoy taking moments to connect with each other and find these moments make work more enjoyable.\n6. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's competence and effort in their work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides general information about the relationship between Co-workers A and B, highlighting their ability to work well together, the value they place on communication, and the positive impact of Co-worker A's work ethic. While this information is helpful in understanding the overall dynamic between the two co-workers, it lacks specific details or context that directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY does not provide a clear connection to the specific content of the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around the discussion of leadership styles and the importance of teamwork. Although it provides a general sense of cooperation and appreciation, it doesn't offer specific insights that would be immediately useful for generating the next response based on the current dialogue.\n\nThe memory is composed of logically connected sentences that are naturally phrased but could be improved by including more detailed connections to the specific issues addressed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Co-worker Aâ€™s need to balance leadership with teamwork and openness to feedback."
