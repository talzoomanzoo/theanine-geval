Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria. Co-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking? Co-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you? Co-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you. Co-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago? Co-workers B: Yeah, I remember that conversation. What about it? Co-workers A: Well, I wanted to share some good news with you. I've been recently promoted to the night shift and have been doing a great job. I think I've come a long way since those days. Co-workers B: That's awesome, congratulations! I'm proud of you and all the hard work you've put in. You've definitely grown and matured in the workplace. Co-workers A: Thank you, I appreciate that. But I have to admit, I'm still a bit nervous about being wrong. Remember when we talked about my constantly questioning myself and second-guessing my decisions?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n2. Co-worker A expresses nervousness and self-doubt despite their achievements.\n3. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A that making mistakes is okay as long as they learn from them.\n4. Co-worker A is nervous about making mistakes in their new position.\n5. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B acknowledge the importance of taking responsibility for their actions and learning from mistakes.\n6. Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I remember those conversations. It's completely normal to feel a bit nervous, especially in a new position. Just remember, making mistakes is all part of the learning process. You've shown great growth in taking responsibility for your actions and learning from them. Just keep believing in yourself, and you'll continue to excel in your new role.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers a coherent and logically structured set of sentences that correspond well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences in MEMORY helpfully summarize the ongoing themes of the conversation between the co-workers, particularly focusing on Co-worker A's experiences with self-doubt and progression in their professional life. \n\nSeveral lines in MEMORY capture the essence of the conversation, such as Co-worker A's nervousness and Co-worker Bâ€™s supportive role. Furthermore, the theme of making mistakes and learning from them is well documented, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT's discussion about growth and taking responsibility.\n\nThe main reason this does not receive a perfect score of 5 is that although the MEMORY efficiently encapsulates the context, there is room for increased specificity. For instance, it could include more specific past interactions or developments between them that are alluded to in DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the conversation where Co-worker A was considered irresponsible, for richer context. Overall, MEMORY is helpful and naturally constructed to guide the language model in generating appropriate responses."
