Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax. Neighbors B: What kind of breathing exercise? Neighbors A: It's just a simple one, where you inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, and then exhale for eight seconds. I've been doing it every day for the past week and it's made such a difference. Neighbors B: That's really interesting. I've heard that breathing exercises can be really helpful for reducing stress and anxiety. Neighbors A: Yes, it definitely has helped me with that. Plus, it's something that I can easily do anywhere, whether I'm at home or out running errands. Neighbors B: That's great. It's always good to have a simple tool like that to help manage stress.  Neighbors A: Speaking of managing stress, remember a few years ago when I pushed your shoulder because I wanted you to accept me? Neighbors B: Oh yeah, I do remember that. That was a stressful time for both of us. Neighbors A: It definitely was. But I'm so glad that we've been able to move past that and have a good neighborly relationship now. Neighbors B: Me too. And remember when you found that great park a few years ago? Neighbors A: Yes, I loved that park! It was such a fun place to hang out and play games. Neighbors B: It's always nice to find a good outdoor space like that. Have you been back recently? Neighbors A: Not in a little while, but maybe we should plan a visit soon. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A and Neighbor B found a park together a couple of years ago and enjoyed playing frisbee and having a picnic.\n2. Neighbor B reassures Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasizes their current friendship.\n3. Neighbors B values their friendship with Neighbors A.\n4. Neighbors A is willing to take things slow in their relationship with Neighbors B.\n5. Both neighbors enjoy discovering new things in their neighborhood and spending time with their children.\n6. Neighbors A has developed romantic feelings for Neighbors B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a wonderful idea. I'd love to go back to that park with you and maybe even bring the kids along this time. It would be a great way to spend some quality time together and enjoy the outdoors.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the mention of the park in Memory 1 and Neighbor B's reassurance about past incidents in Memory 2. These align closely with the dialogue conversation, indicating a development and history between the two neighbors which helps in continuing their interaction naturally. The MEMORY supports the conversation topic about past experiences and how they've moved past stressful events, as mentioned in the dialogue. Memory 3, 4, and 5 mention values and activities they share, which enhance the background understanding of their relationship dynamics. However, Memory 6 about romantic feelings doesn't seem to directly correlate with the dialogue context and could be misleading if interpreted as relevant to the current conversation. Overall, MEMORY includes a substantial amount of helpful information for generating the next response, with only a small portion potentially irrelevant."
