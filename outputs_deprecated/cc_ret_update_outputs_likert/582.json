    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. Neighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off. Neighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks? Neighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else. Neighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location? Neighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home. Neighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become. Neighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice. Neighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along?  Neighbors A: It's finished! Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. It was a lot of work, but worth it in the end.  Neighbors B: That's amazing, thanks for building me such a beautiful house.  Neighbors A: Of course, I'm glad you like it. Remember when we watched the sunset over the London skyline? That was such a beautiful moment. Neighbors B: Yes, I still remember the pink and orange hues reflecting off the buildings. It was breathtaking. Neighbors A: Speaking of London, have you heard about those recent cases of identity theft? It's terrible that people like that exist.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A and Neighbor B discuss organizing a community event to make a positive impact and appreciate the beauty of their city.\n2. Neighbor A considers Neighbor B a great neighbor and wanted to do something special for them.\n3. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n4. Neighbors B received a new house built by Neighbors A and is grateful for the extra space.\n5. Neighbors A had help from friends in building the new house.\n6. Neighbor B has not been up to anything interesting lately but is excited about the new house and looking forward to it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, it's truly upsetting that there are individuals who would take advantage of others like that. We must all stay vigilant and protect our personal information as best as we can. On a brighter note, I can't wait to host a little get-together in the new house to celebrate with everyone.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could assist in generating future responses in line with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Key details such as Neighbor A building a house for Neighbor B and the gratitude for the extra space are directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These pieces of information highlight past interactions and help in understanding the relationship and dynamics between the neighbors. Additionally, the memory that Neighbor A wanted to do something special for Neighbor B aligns with the part of the context where they discuss projects and advice on goals.\n\nHowever, some parts of the MEMORY, like the community event and using skills for good, though well-structured, are only vaguely related to the immediate conversation context, specifically the focus and procrastination issues initially discussed. These statements do not offer much that a language model could use to continue or enrich the current dialogue directly. While they add to the understanding of the general relationship and intentions between the neighbors, their direct relevance to the current situation is limited. Overall, MEMORY is somewhat helpful but lacks consistently strong connections to the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
