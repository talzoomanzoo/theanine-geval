    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, have you checked out my new blog? It's all about promoting under-the-radar artists. Classmates B: I haven't had a chance to yet, but that sounds really cool! What inspired you to start it? Classmates A: Well, I've always had a passion for the arts, but I was too afraid to pursue it. I finally realized that it's what I really love, and I wanted to share that love with others. Classmates B: That's amazing. It takes a lot of courage to pursue your passions like that. Classmates A: Yeah, it was scary at first, but the response has been really positive. I'm so glad I finally decided to take the leap. Classmates B: I'm proud of you. It's always great to see someone following their dreams.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A ended up taking Classmates B's advice and found success with it.\n2. Both Classmates A and B value the importance of trying new things and taking risks for personal development.\n3. Classmates B expresses a desire to see Classmates A happy and successful in life.\n4. Classmates A was initially hesitant about following Classmates B's advice.\n5. Classmates B gave advice to Classmates A in the past that paid off.\n6. Classmate B emphasizes the importance of positively impacting others while living a fulfilling life.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically relating to Classmate A's actions and experiences with Classmate B's advice. Sentences 1, 4, and 5 imply a past conversation where Classmate B advised Classmate A, aligning with the theme of taking risks and pursuing passions mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This background can help a language model understand the mutual understanding and support between the classmates. However, the MEMORY does not contain explicit details directly related to the new blog or the specifics of the advice given, lacking detailed connectivity or development. Sentences 2, 3, and 6 provide general traits of the classmates but don't directly relate to the ongoing dialogue or new blog venture in a specific way, reducing the immediate helpfulness for generating the next response. Overall, the past interactions are relevant, but not deeply informative or developed regarding the specifics of Classmate A's newfound venture or blog, warranting a middle score."
