    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life. Child: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you. Parent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you. Child: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you? Parent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The child offers help and reassurance to the parent.\n3. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n4. The parent had a tough time when they got arrested and had to rely on a lawyer and the justice system for help.\n5. The parent values independence and self-sufficiency.\n6. The parent wants to provide a safe and stable environment for the child.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad you found someone who listened to you during that difficult time. It must have been a relief to have someone who understood what you were going through. Your strength and resilience inspire me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which reflects on the Parent's past experiences and the importance of listening. Sentence 4 mentions the parent's tough time when they were arrested, which is a significant portion of their narrative in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT (\"when you were in detention\"). This connection allows the child model to understand the context of the Parent's past difficulties. Sentences 1 and 2, while not directly related to the provided dialogue, offer background on the attitudes and dynamics between the Parent and Child, which can be useful in crafting coherent responses. Sentence 3 gives insight into the Child's perspective on the Parent's experiences, allowing responses to take into account the Child's views. Sentences 5 and 6 are less directly related to the dialogue but contribute to the overall tone and relationship between Parent and Child. Overall, MEMORY provides a helpful amount of detail related to the CONTEXT while maintaining clarity in their connections."
