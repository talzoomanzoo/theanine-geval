Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing! Neighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go? Neighbors A: I visited Brazil and Peru. The culture and food were incredible. Neighbors B: That sounds awesome. I've always wanted to go to Peru to see Machu Picchu. Neighbors A: Yes, Machu Picchu is amazing. The view from the top is breathtaking. Neighbors B: Have you thought about where you want to go next? Neighbors A: Yeah, I'm thinking about visiting Australia and Antarctica next. I want to see the Great Barrier Reef and the penguins. Neighbors B: Wow, that's quite a contrast. From the hot desert to the cold ice. It must be interesting to experience such different environments. Neighbors A: Definitely, that's what I love about traveling. You get to see and experience so much diversity in the world.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and B believe in doing nice things for others to bring the community together.\n2. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's organization skills and wishes to improve their own organization.\n3. Neighbors A and B both took a cooking class together last year.\n4. Both Neighbors A and B believe in the importance of learning and self-improvement.\n5. Neighbor B suggests finding other ways to relieve frustration and looking out for Neighbor A's well-being.\n6. Neighbor A is feeling frustrated and is considering going to a bar to find someone for a casual encounter.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's great that you enjoy exploring different cultures and environments through your travels. It's a wonderful way to learn and grow. Maybe we can even plan another cooking class together inspired by the cuisines you've experienced on your trips.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains information about the general relationship and past interactions between Neighbors A and B, such as their beliefs and activities (e.g., taking a cooking class together, valuing self-improvement, Neighbor B admiring Neighbor A's organization skills). However, none of the sentences directly relate to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Neighbor A's recent travels to South America and plans for future travels. \n\nThe MEMORY does not include any relevant background that could help the language model generate a more contextually rich or informed response to this particular conversation about traveling experiences. While it provides some general context about the relationship between the neighbors, the specific interactions and details mentioned do not add significant value to the dialogue about travel destinations and experiences.\n\nThus, while the MEMORY is somewhat naturally structured and gives a sense of the relationship between Neighbors A and B, its relevance to the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT discussing travel is minimal, justifying a low score."
