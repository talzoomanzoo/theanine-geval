Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today. Wife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that. Husband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you. Wife: You always go above and beyond, dear. Husband: It's the little things that count, right? Wife: Definitely. Speaking of little things, do you remember when you told me about catching the bus just in time a few months ago? Husband: Oh yes, I remember. I was so relieved I didn't have to wait in the cold for the next one. Wife: It's amazing how small moments like that can make such a big difference in our day, isn't it? Husband: Absolutely. It's the small moments that make life worth living. Wife: And speaking of living, you mentioned a while back how involved you are in the different ministries at church. Husband: Yes, I'm so grateful for the community and support I've found there. It's helped me grow in my faith so much. Wife: It's wonderful to see you so passionate and dedicated to something you believe in.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful.\n2. Husband values the supportive community of believers at church and appreciates having his wife by his side.\n3. The wife is glad to see the husband finding a sense of purpose and being happy.\n4. The husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that make him happy outside of work and family life.\n5. Wife is supportive of her husband's faith journey and values having a close relationship with him.\n6. The husband's faith has been strong lately, and he is involved in various church ministries.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that helps to generate a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Many of the sentences in MEMORY align well with the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, capturing the essence of the coupleâ€™s dynamic and shared sentiments. For example, sentences like \"Both the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful\" and \"The wife's supportive of her husband's faith journey\" are directly relevant to the conversation about small moments and faith. The MEMORY captures the development and mutual support between the husband and wife, which is central to their interaction. However, some parts of MEMORY, such as the husband's activities outside of work and family life, though naturally phrased, don't directly relate to the current dialogue. Therefore, while the MEMORY is generally structured well and useful, it could have been slightly more focused on the direct elements of the present context to receive a perfect score."
