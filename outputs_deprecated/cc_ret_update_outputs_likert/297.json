Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins. Neighbors B: Oh, okay. I didn't realize there was any confusion about that.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A and Neighbor B went to a concert together in the past and had a great time.\n2. Neighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B.\n3. Both neighbors emphasize the importance of taking care of each other as neighbors.\n4. Neighbors A offers to help Neighbors B with getting into a workout routine.\n5. Neighbors B offers to be more supportive and check in on Neighbors A more often.\n6. Neighbors A is feeling overwhelmed and stressed, mentioning having a lot on their plate.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some past interactions between Neighbor A and Neighbor B, but these interactions do not directly address the boundary issue discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the MEMORY provides some background on their relationship (concert attendance, book sharing, mutual support), it lacks specific details that would help the language model generate a meaningful and relevant response to the current dialogue context about property boundaries. The information is somewhat helpful as it shows a general friendly rapport and willingness to support each other, which might inform the tone, but it lacks specificity and direct relevance to the current situation or conversation about marking property lines."
