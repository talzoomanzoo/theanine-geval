Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess. Classmates B: Wait, what? You cheated on your taxes? That's not okay. Classmates A: I know, I know. I was just really struggling financially and I thought I could get away with it. Classmates B: You can't just cheat and hope to never get caught. That's not how it works. Classmates A: Remember when we talked about me wanting to become a professional basketball player?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A has a big dream of becoming a professional basketball player and works hard towards that goal.\n2. Classmate A is pursuing a dream of becoming a professional basketball player and is working at a grocery store to save up money for training.\n3. Classmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed.\n4. Classmates A believes in hard work and dedication to achieve goals both in basketball and their job.\n5. Classmate B brought goods to Classmate A's house and is supportive of their basketball dream.\n6. Classmates A sometimes doubts if they are good enough to make it to the professional level.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I do remember that dream of yours. Just like in basketball, you need to stay focused, work hard, and believe in yourself to overcome challenges. If you ever need help navigating through tough times, don't hesitate to reach out. You got this!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information regarding Classmates A's dream of becoming a professional basketball player, which is mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This connection is beneficial as it provides background context to Classmate A's current struggle with financial issues and their decision to cheat on taxes. Specifically, MEMORY sentences 1, 2, and 6 help to establish past interactions between the classmates, showing how Classmate A has been consistently working towards their basketball goals. These sentences provide useful context for generating a response by highlighting Classmate A's motivations and financial struggles.\n\nHowever, there is room for improvement as some sentences (3, 4, and 5) could have been more directly tied to how they manifest in the present context of the conversation about cheating on taxes. While these sentences reveal Classmate B's supportive role and encouragement, they lack clear relevance to the ongoing discussion about Classmate A's mistake and financial struggles relating to this episode. Overall, the MEMORY provides some helpful context, but could be more effectively structured to demonstrate causality or development directly connected to the immediate situation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
