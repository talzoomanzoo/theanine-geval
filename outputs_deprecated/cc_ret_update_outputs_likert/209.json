Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor B reassures Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasizes their current friendship.\n2. Neighbors A is willing to take things slow in their relationship with Neighbors B.\n3. Neighbors A has developed romantic feelings for Neighbors B.\n4. Neighbor A went to the park with their son, who had a great time.\n5. Neighbor A and Neighbor B found a park together a couple of years ago and enjoyed playing frisbee and having a picnic.\n6. Neighbors A ordered pizza for Neighbors B in the past.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! I'm glad you found something that works for you. Remember, I'm always here if you need any more relaxation tips or just someone to talk to.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains a mixture of content, some of which can be helpful for generating a suitable next response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 1 and 2 provide some insight into the relationship between Neighbor A and Neighbor B, suggesting an ongoing friendship, which could tie into discussions about mutual experiences like finding relaxation together. Sentence 5 could also be helpful as it references a shared activity, hinting at camaraderie and relaxation similar to the breathing exercise mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, sentences 3, 4, and 6 are less directly relevant, with sentence 3 introducing an element of romantic feelings not present in the current dialogue context, and sentence 4 and 6 focusing on activities unrelated to the current conversation. While the MEMORY provides some useful context, the connections and relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT are not consistently strong. Therefore, the MEMORY earns a middle-of-the-road score of 3."
