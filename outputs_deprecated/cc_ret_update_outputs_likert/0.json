Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The parent values independence and self-sufficiency.\n3. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n4. The child offers help and reassurance to the parent.\n5. The parent wants to provide a safe and stable environment for the child.\n6. Both the parent and child enjoy spending time together in their new home.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I agree, being a good listener is so important. It helps us understand each other better and strengthens our bond. If you ever need someone to listen, I'm here for you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers some insight into the Parent's values and relationship dynamics with the Child, such as valuing independence, appreciating small moments, and wanting to provide a safe environment. However, it lacks a direct connection to the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT about being a good listener. While the memory of the child finding the parent's story inspiring and offering help is somewhat relevant, it doesn't directly support generating an immediate, context-specific response about listening skills. The sentences in MEMORY are not naturally connected in a way that highlights their direct relevance to the dialogue context, thus limiting its helpfulness for generating a nuanced and contextually appropriate response."
