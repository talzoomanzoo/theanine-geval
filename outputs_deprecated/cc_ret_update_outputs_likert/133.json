Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss! Co-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes. Co-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan. Co-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway. Co-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way. Co-workers B: And sometimes it is, but we all have different ideas and perspectives to bring to the table. Co-workers A: Okay, I see your point. I'll try to be more open-minded in the future. Co-workers B: That's all we can ask for. Remember that we're a team and we all have something valuable to contribute. Co-workers A: You're right. I'm glad we can have these conversations and work towards being better together. Co-workers B: Me too. Speaking of working together, do you remember when you gave me back my watch a few months ago? That meant a lot to me. Co-workers A: Of course I remember! I'm happy we're friends again. Co-workers B: Me too. And do you still have that baby doll and rattle you bought a couple of years ago?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.\n2. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B enjoy taking moments to connect with each other and find these moments make work more enjoyable.\n3. Co-worker A returned a watch to Co-worker B, making them happy again.\n4. Co-worker A has a history of helping out Co-worker B and values their friendship.\n5. Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues.\n6. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's competence and effort in their work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, although it could still be improved. It clearly outlines the positive relationship and dynamic between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, including acknowledgment of each other's work ethic and efforts, the meaningful act of returning the watch, and their enjoyment in connecting with each other. These details closely align with the context of a conversation centered around collaboration, mutual respect, and friendship. However, some sentences, such as the general appreciation of competence and effort in the workplace, are somewhat generic and could be better integrated with the specific context or conversational turns mentioned. Additionally, there could be more emphasis on Co-worker B's inquiry about the baby doll and rattle to make the MEMORY more contextually relevant and complete. Overall, the MEMORY is mostly structured in a useful, natural way, providing a strong foundation for generating future responses based on the dialogue."
