Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nAthlete: Ted Athlete unrolls the map. He looks at it for a few moments before tracing his finger along one of the highways. \"This is our route,\" he says finally, feeling in control. Coach: What route are you planning, Ted? Athlete: I'm thinking of taking the highway through the mountains, it's a bit longer, but the scenery is beautiful. Coach: That sounds like a good plan, as long as we factor in enough time for rest stops and breaks. Athlete: Yes, I was thinking we could stop at a few rest areas along the way. It's important to stay hydrated and keep our energy levels up during long drives.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The coach advises the athlete on pre-game meals, emphasizing the need for a balance of carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats, as well as staying hydrated.\n2. The Coach reminds the Athlete that little distractions can add up and impact performance.\n3. The Athlete is focused on helping the team succeed and has shown leadership qualities during warm-ups and stretches.\n4. The coach encourages the athlete to continue their good work with nutrition and training.\n5. The Athlete is focused on improving their performance and energy levels.\n6. The Coach encourages the Athlete to keep up the good work and acknowledges their achievements.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, staying hydrated and taking breaks will help us arrive feeling refreshed and ready to perform at our best. It's all about maintaining that focus and energy, both on the road and on the field.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about the relationship and interactions between the coach and athlete, focusing on topics like nutrition, performance, and encouragement. However, it does not offer any direct information or context about the current dialogue, which involves planning a route for a journey through the mountains and stopping at rest areas for breaks. The MEMORY lacks specific details or cues related to travel planning or scenic routes, which are central to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the memory doesn't clearly demonstrate the development or causality of the conversation related to the route planning. While the MEMORY is generally related to maintaining performance and focus, its connection to the immediate topic is weak, making it less helpful for generating a properly informed response in this context."
