Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind? Classmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you. Classmates B: Oh, really? Classmates A: Yes, really. I know we've been friends for a while now, but I feel like there may be something more between us.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B are close and have a level of trust between them.\n2. Classmates A discovered a secret that Classmates B has been keeping.\n3. Classmates A and B are students in the same class.\n4. Classmates A was worried about a situation but it turned out to be not a big deal.\n5. Classmates A offered help and support to Classmates B.\n6. Classmates A and B have had a previous positive interaction in a coffee shop where Classmates A rubbed Classmates B's neck, providing relaxation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate you sharing that with me. I value our friendship a lot, and I think it's great that we can be so open with each other.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for the language model to generate a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Classmates A and B are close and have a level of trust between them, which aligns with Classmates A expressing deeper feelings towards Classmates B in the dialogue. Additionally, MEMORY indicates past supportive interactions, like Classmates A offering help and rubbing Classmates B's neck, suggesting a comfort level between them. These cues can assist in understanding the dynamics of their relationship. However, not all sentences in MEMORY are directly relevant to the current dialogue context, like the secret Classmates B has been keeping or the worry about a non-significant situation. These elements do not directly contribute to the growing emotional context presented in the dialogue. Overall, the MEMORY is moderately helpful but could be more focused on sentiment-related cues."
