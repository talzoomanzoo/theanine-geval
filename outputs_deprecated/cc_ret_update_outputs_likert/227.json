    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now! Neighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen? Neighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest. Neighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations! What are you going to do with all that money? Neighbors A: Well, first I'm going to pay off my mortgage and all my debts. After that, I think I'll take a nice long vacation and maybe donate some to charity. Neighbors B: That's very generous of you. Have you thought about investing any of it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's decision and admires the courage it took.\n2. Neighbors A made a big career change recently and is much happier now.\n3. Neighbors B has been supportive of Neighbors A's job search, offering to connect them with people in different industries.\n4. Neighbors A took the leap to make a change and is glad they did.\n5. Neighbors A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship.\n6. Neighbors A and B had a conversation a couple of years ago about needing a change.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, I've been considering investing a portion of it. I want to make sure it grows and secures a comfortable future for me. It's all so new and exciting, but I'm grateful for your support and advice throughout this journey.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains general information about Neighbors A and B's past interactions, such as Neighbors B's consistent support for Neighbors A and their past career change. However, the sentences mostly focus on Neighbors A's career instead of the recent inheritance situation that is present in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY does not provide much helpful information related to Neighbors Aâ€™s financial windfall or their planned actions with the money. While it depicts the supportive nature of the relationship between the neighbors, the details do not significantly aid in generating a response around the inheritance context. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate as the MEMORY provides limited relevant context to build on for the next dialogue response."
