Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend! Co-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang. Co-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while. Co-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing? Co-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites. Co-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice. Co-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it. Co-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent. Co-workers A: Thanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it. Co-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have a hobby like that. Reminds me of when you uncovered that mystery a while back. You always seem to surprise us with your skills. Co-workers A: Haha, yeah. I do like a good challenge. Speaking of surprises, remember when I found out you were married? That was a shocker.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n2. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together.\n3. Co-worker A has a talent for solving puzzles and mysteries.\n4. Co-worker A is observant and did some research on social media to find out that Co-worker B is married.\n5. Co-worker B is married and had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends.\n6. Co-worker A suggests celebrating their detective work with drinks after work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It was definitely unexpected, but you did some impressive detective work to figure it out. I guess we both have our hidden talents!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several helpful pieces of information that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. First, sentences 1 and 4 directly correlate with the context where Co-worker A talks about finding out Co-worker B was married, which Co-worker B remarks was a surprise. Sentence 3 mentions Co-worker A's talent for solving puzzles, which relates to the comment about uncovering a mystery, thus giving context to the mentioned \"skills\". Additionally, the MEMORY notes that Co-worker A is observant and uses social media research techniques, which may complement future conversations surrounding A's detective skills. Sentence 2 speaks to the positive past interactions between A and B, reinforcing their friendly relationship. Sentence 6, while not directly connected to singing at church, suggests potential continuity or future plans based on their detective collaboration, illustrating their dynamic. The only outlier is sentence 5, which is not connected to the current context but is phrased naturally, minimally impacting the overall helpfulness. Together, the MEMORY sufficiently aids understanding and response generation for the language model."
