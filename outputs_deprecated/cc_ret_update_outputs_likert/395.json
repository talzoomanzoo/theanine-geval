    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway? Wife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go? Husband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city. Wife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change. Husband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think? Wife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it. Husband: Great. I'll start looking for rental cabins right away. I know this may sound impulsive, but I'm really excited to make this happen. Wife: Don't worry, husband, it's not impulsive.

And, I want to apologize for the time I left without waiting for you. I know I promised to wait, and I should have kept my word. Wife: It's okay, husband. I understand that you were in a hurry, and it wasn't intentional. Besides, that was a long time ago, and we've moved past it. Husband: Thank you for being so understanding, wife. I just want to make sure I am not repeating the same mistake again. Wife: I trust that you won't, husband. And hey, remember when I stopped a runaway carriage from causing harm to a group of people? That was quite the adrenaline rush! Husband: Oh, I remember that, wife. You are fearless, and I'm so proud of you. Wife: Thanks, husband. And speaking of good times, I had so much fun at the dance a few weeks ago. Dancing with you always puts me in a good mood.\n\nMEMORY:\n1.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: MEMORY provides several helpful elements for generating a response in the context. It captures the husband's acknowledgment and apology for a past mistake, highlighting the value he places on promises and actions (Sentence 6). This aligns with the context where he assures the wife that he will not repeat his mistake. It also reflects the wife's encouragement and positivity, which is evident in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT (Sentences 2 and 3). Furthermore, MEMORY notes the husband's pride and admiration of his wife's bravery (Sentence 4), consistent with the discussion of the runaway carriage event. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions their commitment and excitement for the future (Sentence 5), resonating with their plans for a getaway. However, some elements could be more explicit about direct connections, such as linking the wife's selflessness with her action in DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Despite this, the sentences offer a coherent background that can aid in generating context-appropriate responses, meriting a score of 4."
