Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that. Neighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\n2. Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received.\n3. Neighbors A is detail-oriented and strives for perfection.\n4. Neighbors B values reciprocity and acknowledges the mutual help between them as neighbors.\n5. Neighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship as neighbors.\n6. Neighbors A wants to rearrange their living room and Neighbors B has experience with rearranging furniture.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I just wanted everything to be perfect with the living room setup, but I got overwhelmed with all the details. Thank you for being so patient and helping me out.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, sentences 1 and 4 highlight the supportive and understanding dynamic between Neighbors A and B, as well as the mutual help they provide each other. This context of a positive relationship can inform the language model to generate a response that aligns with this sentiment. Sentence 5 is also relevant as it broadly describes the helpful relationship between the neighbors. However, sentences 2, 3, and 6, while naturally phrased, do not directly relate to the dialogue context or shed light on the interaction at hand. Sentence 2 highlights Neighbors A's gratitude but is not directly tied to the current situation. Sentence 3's mention of detail-orientation and perfection isn't directly relevant to the immediate dialogue. Sentence 6 mentions rearranging furniture, which is unrelated to the discussion about swearing or frustration. Overall, while some sentences are relevant, others do not provide clear contextual cues or development related to the dialogue, hence the rating of 3."
