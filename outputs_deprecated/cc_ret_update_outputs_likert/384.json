Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway? Wife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go? Husband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband apologized and promised to involve the wife in his plans in the future.\n2. The husband is inspired by his wife to take action on his dreams and goals.\n3. The husband is excited about his progress on long-awaited plans and is putting in a lot of effort to make them a reality.\n4. The husband values the wife's encouragement and positivity in his pursuit of his goals.\n5. The husband and wife are committed to each other and excited about their future together.\n6. The wife admires the husband's determination and big heart.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides information that is helpful for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY contains sentences that reveal the dynamics of the relationship between the husband and wife, which helps in understanding their interactions better. For instance, it shows that the husband has a history of wanting to involve his wife in his plans (sentence 1), values her encouragement (sentence 4), and is inspired by her (sentence 2). This background knowledge makes it relevant to the current dialogue about planning a getaway together. Additionally, their commitment to each other and excitement about their future (sentence 5) aligns well with the husband's motivation to spend more time together. However, while the sentences are relevant and well-structured, some are more focused on the husband's personal aspirations and less directly tied to the specific topic of a getaway, hence not warranting the highest score."
