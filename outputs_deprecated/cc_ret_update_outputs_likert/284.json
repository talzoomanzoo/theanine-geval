    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn. Teacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation? Student: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The teacher and student have a positive and understanding relationship.\n2. The student mentioned feeling stressed lately, which may have led to the outburst.\n3. The student once saved a kid from drowning and had a moment of yelling at the teacher in the past.\n4. The student felt rewarded by the experience and emphasized the importance of being aware of surroundings and acting quickly in emergencies.\n5. The teacher expressed understanding and encouraged the student to seek help when needed.\n6. The student appreciated the teacher's support and apologized again for the incident.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about the relationship between the teacher and the student, indicating that they share a positive and understanding dynamic. However, most of the specific memories, such as the student's past experience of saving a kid from drowning or the outburst and apologizing incident, are not particularly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the hot sauce and its effects. These memories reflect past events but do not offer helpful information or contextual cues that directly relate to the topic of the current conversation. While these memories display the development of the relationship between the teacher and the student, they do not assist in generating a response related to the specific discussion of hot sauce. Thus, the MEMORY lacks helpfulness in providing relevant information for the given dialogue context."
