Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend! Co-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang. Co-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while. Co-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing? Co-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites. Co-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice. Co-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it. Co-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent. Co-workers A: Thanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it. Co-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have a hobby like that. Reminds me of when you uncovered that mystery a while back. You always seem to surprise us with your skills.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together.\n2. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n3. Co-worker A has a talent for solving puzzles and mysteries.\n4. Co-worker B is married and had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends.\n5. Co-worker A suggests celebrating their detective work with drinks after work.\n6. Co-worker A is observant and did some research on social media to find out that Co-worker B is married.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Haha, thanks! I guess I have a knack for uncovering secrets, whether it's through singing or solving puzzles. Maybe we should combine our detective skills and find the hidden talent in everyone at the office!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, sentences 3 and 6 relate to Co-worker A's skill in solving mysteries, which is hinted at by Co-worker B's comment about uncovering a mystery and surprising them with skills. This connection aids in understanding Co-worker A's character in the conversation. However, not all sentences are directly relevant; sentences about Co-worker B's hiking weekend and Co-worker A offering drinks after work do not contribute to the current dialogue about singing, thus lowering the overall helpfulness. Additionally, some sentences could be more naturally phrased or better connected to the current context. Overall, MEMORY captures some essential aspects of the co-workers' past interactions, but it lacks coherence and precise relevancy to earn a higher score."
