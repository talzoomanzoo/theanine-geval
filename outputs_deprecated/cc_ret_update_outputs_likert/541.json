    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, check out this spot I found to camp out for the night. It's perfect! Classmates B: Wow, this view is amazing! Classmates A: I know, right? And it's completely level and free of any debris. We won't have to worry about rolling off our sleeping pads or anything like that. Classmates B: It definitely looks like a great spot to spend the night. How did you manage to find it? Classmates A: Just a stroke of luck, I guess. I was exploring the area and stumbled upon it. It's always good to be a little adventurous and explore new places, you never know what you might find.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate A expresses a desire to find alternative ways to have fun and make a positive impact in the community.\n2. Classmates A is proactive and curious, taking the initiative to research topics of interest.\n3. Classmates B finds Classmates A's involvement in the community admirable and important.\n4. Classmate A and Classmate B are classmates who attended a party together.\n5. Classmates B remembers Classmates A's previous involvement in community improvement projects and acknowledges their passion for making a difference.\n6. Classmate A is concerned about the party being discovered and getting in trouble with the school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, being adventurous can lead to some incredible discoveries. I remember how your curiosity and sense of exploration have always led to amazing things, both in nature and in the community.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information about the two classmates and their characteristics, such as Classmate A's proactive nature and involvement in community projects. These details support the context where Classmate A discovers a great campsite, reinforcing their adventurous and exploratory traits. There are references to past community involvement and a shared party experience, which could offer relevant backstory to their relationship and joint activities. However, the MEMORY lacks a direct connection to the specific camping scenario in the dialogue context, especially regarding the choice of campsite. The sentences are naturally phrased, but more information directly related to camping or past outdoor experiences would have been helpful for generating a more tailored response. Overall, while some context development and relevant traits are provided, it's not entirely aligned with the current dialogue context, leading to a middle-ground score."
