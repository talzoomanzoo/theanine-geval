Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away. Co-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that. Co-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way. Co-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you. Co-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's positivity and friendship.\n3. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n4. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\n5. Co-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\n6. Co-worker A intervened to help two women who were fighting, showing bravery and a desire to make a positive impact.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I understand that it's hard to control your feelings, Co-workers A, but it's important to always consider the other person's perspective and boundaries. Just like you felt guilty about the pencil, it's crucial to acknowledge and respect the feelings and choices of others, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. Let's find healthier ways to express your feelings for the bride without causing harm.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some pieces of information that might provide minimal context for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but overall, it lacks direct relevance and cohesiveness to be truly helpful. Sentence 1 about the pencil is somewhat relevant as it mirrors Co-worker A's tendency to act on impulse, reflecting their current sentiment about stealing the bride. However, the rest of the MEMORY, such as Co-worker B's appreciation (sentence 2), buying coffee as recompense (sentence 3), or Co-worker A helping two women (sentence 6), offers little direct connection or causality to the current dialogue's topic of \"kidnapping\" the bride and discussing love and choices. The other sentences, such as Co-worker A being alive and needing to adjust (sentence 5), are unrelated and do not help understand the dynamic or development between the speakers, thereby not enhancing the language modelâ€™s ability to generate a relevant next response effectively."
