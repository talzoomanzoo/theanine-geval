Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me. Co-workers B: That's amazing to hear. Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job. Co-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work. Co-workers B: It's great to have that kind of positive reinforcement. Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.\n2. Co-worker A and Co-worker B are excited about working on future projects together and even starting their own production company someday.\n3. Co-worker A and Co-worker B met on a movie set and are now good friends.\n4. Co-worker B emphasized the importance of learning from mistakes and working together as a team.\n5. Co-worker A is grateful for life experiences and is open to new possibilities in the future.\n6. Co-worker B and Co-worker A met on a movie set where Co-worker A was focused on acting.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I remember that. It was a challenging time, but your encouragement and support really helped me push through it. That experience taught me a lot about resilience and the value of teamwork.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about Co-workers A and B, including their past collaboration and friendship, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they discuss their supportive work environment. Sentence 1 aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as it highlights the positive collaboration between the two co-workers, which ties into the supportive environment they are discussing. Sentence 4 provides a relevant detail about teamwork, which complements Co-worker A's feeling of motivation and security, stemming from support. Sentence 3 establishes the initial connection between the speakers on a movie set, which supports the ongoing discussion of their work history.\n\nHowever, sentences 2, 5, and 6 introduce additional details about future plans, gratitude for life experiences, and specific roles on set that do not directly contribute to generating the next response about their current discussion of supportive work relationships. These sentences, while not entirely irrelevant, are less directly connected to the immediate dialogue context.\n\nWhile the MEMORY contains some useful information, its help in generating the next response could have been enhanced by more direct alignment with the ongoing conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The natural phrasing and coherence in the MEMORY provide a reasonable foundation, resulting in a helpfulness score of 3."
