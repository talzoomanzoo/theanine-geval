Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A was worried about a situation but it turned out to be not a big deal.\n2. Classmates A and B are students in the same class.\n3. Classmates A offered help and support to Classmates B.\n4. Classmates A discovered a secret that Classmates B has been keeping.\n5. Classmates A invited Classmates B to join the study group together for extra support and studying.\n6. Classmates A and B are close and have a level of trust between them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides a number of relevant pieces of information that could be helpful for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Several memories demonstrate that Classmates A and B have a supportive and trusting relationship (memories 3, 5, and 6), which might inform the tone or content of the conversation Classmate A wishes to have. Additionally, there are relevant events like Classmate A discovering a secret from Classmate B (memory 4) that could be important contextually for any discussions about sensitive matters. While not every sentence is directly relevant to the immediate dialogue, each sentence is well-structured, naturally connected, and aids in portraying the relational context between the speakers. However, not every memory piece is directly tied to a conversation's causality or progression (e.g., memory 1 about a worry that wasn't a big deal), therefore the score is not a full 5."
