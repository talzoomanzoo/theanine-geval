Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message. Co-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident. Co-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows. Co-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive. Co-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right. Co-workers B: Speaking of convincing people, have you ever been in a physical altercation before? Co-workers A: Yes, unfortunately. But that doesn't mean I'm a danger to people. I just don't back down from a fight when I'm standing up for what's right.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs.\n2. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument.\n3. Co-worker A has experience dealing with challenging clients and emphasizes the importance of communication and setting expectations.\n4. Co-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\n5. Co-worker A believes their evidence is more compelling than the opposing side's evidence.\n6. Co-worker A is perceived as dangerous by others due to their behavior in conflicts.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains several relevant and helpful pieces of information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. Sentence 1 in the MEMORY aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Co-worker A talks about not backing down from a fight when defending what is right.\n2. Sentence 2 connects to Co-worker A's emphasis on the importance of backing claims with evidence, reinforcing their confidence in presenting arguments.\n3. Sentence 4 complements the DIALOGUE CONTEXT's discussion about presenting statistical and factual evidence, directly relating to Co-worker Aâ€™s approach.\n4. Sentence 6 is notably relevant since Co-worker A discusses being perceived as dangerous due to past altercations, which ties into the dialog about physical confrontations.\n5. Sentence 3 and 5, while not directly mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, are phrased in a way that maintains coherence with Co-worker A's experience in debates and handling challenging situations.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides useful information that enhances understanding of Co-worker A's personality and past interactions, although not all sentences are explicitly reflected in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, they are naturally structured and demonstrate clear relevance and development of Co-worker A's character, which assists in generating an appropriate response."
