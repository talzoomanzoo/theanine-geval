    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I just finished my computer course, and I learned so much about using computers effectively. Classmates B: That's great! What did you learn specifically? Classmates A: Oh, a lot of things. I learned how to use different programs and software for different tasks, and how to choose the right one depending on what I need to do. Classmates B: Do you have any software recommendations for me? I always struggle with choosing the right program. Classmates A: It really depends on what you need the software for. But for basic tasks like word processing or spreadsheet management, I would recommend Microsoft Office. It's user-friendly and versatile.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and Classmates B are friends who help each other with schoolwork.\n2. Classmate B is a supportive friend who listens and offers to help.\n3. Classmates B and Classmates A used to dance a lot in middle school.\n4. Classmate A appreciates having friends who are there for them during difficult times.\n5. Classmates B supported Classmates A through a tough time by listening to them.\n6. Classmates A has matured since then and learned from past mistakes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks for the recommendation! I'll definitely check out Microsoft Office for my basic tasks. It's great to have friends like you who always have helpful advice.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains some useful background information that establishes the dynamic between Classmates A and B, which could aid in generating responses in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Items 1, 2, and 5 suggest a supportive relationship where Classmate B is a good listener and willing to help, which is pertinent to their conversation about learning and recommending software. Additionally, item 4 highlights Classmate A's appreciation for supportive friends, which aligns with the conversational tone of seeking advice and sharing useful information.\n\nHowever, items 3 and 6 about dancing in middle school and Classmate A's maturity from past mistakes are less relevant to the current context about learning from a computer course and might not directly impact the next response in the dialogue. Despite this, the memory is generally well-structured and effectively communicates the relationship between the classmates. Thus, it provides moderate help in generating contextually appropriate responses but could improve in directly addressing the current course-related conversation."
