Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful. Co-workers B: Did you make sure to include all the necessary details? Co-workers A: Yes, I made sure to cover everything we talked about in the meeting. I even added some extra information that I thought could be useful. Co-workers B: That's smart thinking. It shows that you're invested in the company and want to make sure things run smoothly. Co-workers A: Thanks. I learned a lot from taking over the family business. It taught me the importance of being efficient and proactive.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A took over their family's business a few years ago and it has improved since then.\n2. Co-worker B appreciates the pen and thanks Co-worker A for the gesture.\n3. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a thoughtful gesture.\n4. Co-worker B finished a project and sent it to the manager for review.\n5. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value trust in their personal and professional relationships.\n6. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a symbol of trust in their professional relationship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's great to hear that your family business experience has had such a positive impact on your work ethic. Your dedication and proactive approach definitely shine through in your work.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly in sentence 1, which directly connects Co-worker A's experience taking over the family business with what is mentioned in the dialogue. This memory supports the development of Co-worker A's character and their proactive approach. It also contains sentence 5, which aligns with the theme of professionalism and relationship mentioned in the dialogue with the emphasis on trust. However, sentences 2, 3, and 6, while connected, do not directly influence the conversation about report writing. Sentence 4, though clear, does not relate to the current interaction. Overall, while the MEMORY provides some relevant background for understanding Co-worker A's actions, it lacks a stronger connection to the conversation's current focus, which affects its helpfulness score."
