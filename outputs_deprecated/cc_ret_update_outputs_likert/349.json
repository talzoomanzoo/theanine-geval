Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful. Co-workers B: Did you make sure to include all the necessary details? Co-workers A: Yes, I made sure to cover everything we talked about in the meeting.

Co-workers A: Thanks. I learned a lot from taking over the family business. It taught me the importance of being efficient and proactive. Co-workers B: I remember you telling me about that. It's amazing how much you've accomplished since then. Co-workers A: It's been a journey, but I'm glad to see the business flourishing. It gives me a sense of pride and accomplishment. Co-workers B: I can tell. You're always trying to find ways to improve things.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A took over their family's business a few years ago and it has improved since then.\n2. Co-worker B appreciates the pen and thanks Co-worker A for the gesture.\n3. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a thoughtful gesture.\n4. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value trust in their personal and professional relationships.\n5. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a symbol of trust in their professional relationship.\n6. Co-worker B finished a project and sent it to the manager for review.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I believe that constant improvement is key to success, both in business and in personal growth. It's all about striving to be better every day.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 1 directly relates to the context, as Co-worker A mentions taking over the family business and its improvement. This provides context for Co-worker A's comments about being efficient and proactive. Sentence 4 is somewhat related as it talks about trust, which could be relevant to the professional relationship and teamwork between Co-worker A and B, as shown in the dialogue. However, the rest of the MEMORY statements are of limited relevance and do not provide much insight into the development of the dialogue or the specific interaction about the written report that Co-worker A gave to their boss. Nonetheless, they do provide additional background about their relationship in a coherent manner. Therefore, the MEMORY is moderately helpful, leading to a score of 3."
