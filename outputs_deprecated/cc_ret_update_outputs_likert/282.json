    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The student mentioned feeling stressed lately, which may have led to the outburst.\n2. The student felt rewarded by the experience and emphasized the importance of being aware of surroundings and acting quickly in emergencies.\n3. The student once saved a kid from drowning and had a moment of yelling at the teacher in the past.\n4. The student appreciated the teacher's support and apologized again for the incident.\n5. The teacher speaks Spanish and French fluently.\n6. The teacher expressed understanding and encouraged the student to seek help when needed.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information that could potentially relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as statements indicating the student has a history of strong reactions or stress (e.g., outbursts, yelling at the teacher). However, these connections are not explicit or directly relevant to the specific context of the student reacting to hot sauce. The mentions of past incidents and the teacher's abilities are not really pertinent to the current situation involving hot sauce either. Therefore, the MEMORY has limited helpful information for generating the next response in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences could be better structured to highlight causal or relevant links to the student's current situation."
