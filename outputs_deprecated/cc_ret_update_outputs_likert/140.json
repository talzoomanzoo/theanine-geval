    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly. Neighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit? Neighbors A: It was Chicago. I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations. Neighbors B: I bet it was a nice change of scenery from our neighborhood. Neighbors A: Definitely. But you know, it's interesting how much our neighborhood has grown on me over the years. I remember when I first moved here, I was so unsure about it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A enjoys living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbors A is excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends.\n3. Neighbors A just moved to a new neighborhood and is getting to know the area.\n4. Neighbors A appreciates having friendly faces around and hopes to make new friends soon.\n5. Neighbors B acknowledges Neighbors A's friendly and outgoing nature.\n6. Neighbors B has been living in the neighborhood for some time and is supportive of Neighbors A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I remember when you first moved in, you were a bit hesitant about the neighborhood. It's great to see how much you've come to appreciate it now. It's always nice to have a place that feels like home, isn't it?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information about Neighbor A's experience and feelings towards the neighborhood, which ties nicely with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. We can see that Neighbor A has transitioned from uncertainty to enjoying their living situation, evidenced by statements like \"Neighbors A enjoys living in the neighborhood\" and is \"feeling comfortable and safe.\" This context complements Neighbor A's statement in DIALOGUE CONTEXT about how the neighborhood has grown on them over the years. Additionally, the MEMORY includes points about how Neighbors A and B have developed a friendship, and how Neighbors B is supportive. These details enhance the understanding of the relationship dynamics, providing proper contextual cues for generating a response. The only slight gaps are the mentions of Neighbors A just moving to the neighborhood which may not fit the current conversation's timeline perfectly, but overall, the MEMORY is structured coherently and helps build a comprehensive view of the speakers' interactions and history."
