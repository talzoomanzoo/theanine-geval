    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become? Neighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out? Neighbors A: Yes, I go to the gym every day and lift weights. It's been really helping me build muscle. Neighbors B: That's great to hear! It reminds me of the time when you apologized to me for the way you treated me. Neighbors A: Yes, I realized that I needed to take responsibility for my actions and I didn't want to make the same mistake again. Neighbors B: It's always important to own up to our mistakes. It's like when you forgot your backpack in high school and had to deal with the consequences. Neighbors A: Definitely. It taught me to always be prepared and double-check everything. It's like how I make sure to tighten screws and wires when working on my computer.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A apologized to Neighbors B for their behavior and admitted to being wrong.\n2. Neighbors B appreciates Neighbors A's handy skills.\n3. Neighbors A values double-checking before leaving the house.\n4. Neighbors A is good at fixing things, particularly electronics.\n5. Neighbors A and B emphasize the importance of taking care of trees and the environment for future generations.\n6. Neighbor A noticed some wood near their backyard and asked Neighbor B if they had seen it too.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a smart habit to have! It's great that you value double-checking, especially when it comes to fixing electronics. Just like how we need to double-check our actions to ensure we're taking care of the environment for future generations. Speaking of which, have you noticed any changes in the backyard with those wood pieces?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information about past interactions between Neighbors A and B, which can aid in generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 1 captures the apology Neighbors A made to Neighbors B, directly aligning with the dialogue's mention of past behavior and the concept of taking responsibility, which is relevant to the discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 2, 3, and 4 illustrate Neighbors A's skills and values, which although not directly related to the strong build mentioned in the dialogue, does highlight a pattern of improvement and preparedness. However, Sentences 5 and 6 are unrelated to the current dialogue context, and their connection to the topic at hand seems arbitrary and not naturally connected to the conversation of strength and past apologies. Therefore, while the MEMORY provides some helpful context, it could be better structured to offer clearer development and causality cues in correlation with the current dialogue."
