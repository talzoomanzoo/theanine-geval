Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today. Wife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful.\n2. The wife is glad to see the husband finding a sense of purpose and being happy.\n3. The husband feels happy and content being outside in the beautiful weather.\n4. The husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that make him happy outside of work and family life.\n5. The husband enjoys being outside and loves the weather after being stuck indoors at work.\n6. Husband values the supportive community of believers at church and appreciates having his wife by his side.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers some helpful information concerning past interactions between the Husband and Wife, which can assist in generating the next response for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the details are somewhat generic and do not provide direct cues for the specific interaction in the context provided. \n\nKey points from MEMORY that may be helpful include:\n- Sentence 1 about both agreeing on the importance of little things, which corresponds with the Wife's expression of feeling cozy due to the Husband's efforts. \n- Sentence 4 regarding the Husband feeling supported by his wife, which aligns with the Wife appreciating the Husband's actions.\n\nHowever, sentences 2, 3, 5, and 6, while providing insight into their relationship dynamics and values, do not directly relate to the current dialogue about hanging lights and creating a cozy atmosphere. Although they add some general background information about the husband's feelings and values, they are not tightly connected to the immediate context.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY offers some context for understanding the couple's relationship dynamics, it could be more specifically aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT to receive a higher score."
