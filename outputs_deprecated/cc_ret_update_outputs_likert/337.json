    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going? Neighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you? Neighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band. Neighbors B: Really? You had a band? Neighbors A: Yeah, we were called \"The Neighbors A Band.\" We used to play live shows around the city. Neighbors B: That's awesome! What kind of music did you guys play? Neighbors A: We played rock music, mostly covers but we also wrote some of our own songs. Neighbors B: Have you ever thought about starting the band again? Neighbors A: Not really, it was just a fun hobby back then. Plus, I don't think I have the same energy as I did when I was younger. Neighbors B: That's understandable. Do you still play any instruments?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbors B is familiar with Neighbors A's dog and looking forward to playing with it again.\n3. Neighbors B expresses concern for Neighbors A's back pain.\n4. Neighbors A mentions having back pain and needing a break.\n5. Neighbors A is enjoying the different culture and exploring the city.\n6. Neighbor B is interested in chiropractic care after hearing about Neighbor A's positive experience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided has some references that could potentially relate to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but they are not directly relevant or useful for generating the next response. Sentences 1, 3, and 4 might be tangentially related to the discussion about energy and playing instruments because they touch upon support, pain, and taking a break, but these connections are weak. Sentences 2, 5, and 6 are unrelated to the conversation about the rock band, music, or instruments. The MEMORY lacks direct references or development that could significantly benefit the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While some sentences are naturally structured, they do not provide ample contextual cues to inform the next response effectively."
