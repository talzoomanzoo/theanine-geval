Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to share something with you. I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support.\n2. Classmates B handled a previous mix-up with the class schedule well, showing responsibility and reliability.\n3. Classmates A appreciates the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n4. Classmates A and B are making plans to spend time together outside of school.\n5. Classmates A and B started as acquaintances and have developed a strong friendship.\n6. Classmates A and B had a mix-up with names in the past but resolved the issue through communication.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's amazing! You always go above and beyond to help others. Your kindness is truly inspiring.",
    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY does provide some helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY indicates a supportive relationship between Classmates A and B, which could guide the language model in framing a supportive or appreciative response from B to A's sharing about helping a neighbor. The mention of a strong friendship (sentence 5) and shared plans to spend time together (sentence 4) add context that could be relevant if the conversation shifts to personal or social matters. However, some sentences (e.g., 2, 6) concerning past mix-ups and name issues, while showing development of the relationship, are less directly tied to the current context of sharing a good deed, making the MEMORY less cohesive in relevance. The structure of the MEMORY is clear, but not all sentences significantly aid in crafting a relevant response for the given context. Thus, a score of 3 is appropriate as the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but not highly so."
