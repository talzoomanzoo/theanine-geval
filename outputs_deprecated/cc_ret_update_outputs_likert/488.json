Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I just finished my computer course, and I learned so much about using computers effectively. Classmates B: That's great! What did you learn specifically?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and Classmates B are friends who help each other with schoolwork.\n2. Classmates A has matured since then and learned from past mistakes.\n3. Classmates B and Classmates A used to dance a lot in middle school.\n4. Classmates A acknowledges the mistake and plans to learn from it.\n5. Classmates B supported Classmates A through a tough time by listening to them.\n6. Classmate B is a supportive friend who listens and offers to help.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I learned about different operating systems, software applications, and even some coding basics. It was really eye-opening for me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful background information about the relationship between Classmates A and B, indicating they are friends who support each other, which can influence how Classmate A might respond to Classmate B's inquiry about what they learned in the computer course. However, the MEMORY does not directly address the specifics of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT or provide relevant information about the computer course or Classmate A's learning experience. Details about past interactions such as dancing and past mistakes are not directly linked to the current conversation topic, which limits their helpfulness. Overall, while the MEMORY provides some useful interpersonal context, it lacks specific and relevant content directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
