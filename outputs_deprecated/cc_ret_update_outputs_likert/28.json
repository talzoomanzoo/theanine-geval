Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water? Neighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for. Neighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit. Neighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water. Neighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it. Neighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again. Neighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower? Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work. Neighbors A: It was. But it was also a good workout.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A mentioned mowing the lawn with an old push mower, indicating they are responsible for the yard work.\n2. Both Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\n3. Neighbors B agrees that mowing the lawn is a lot of work but acknowledges the exercise it provides.\n4. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n5. Neighbors A and B plan to work on mowing the lawn together next time to make it easier and possibly discover more things in common.\n6. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Definitely. I remember how you mentioned having extra water on hand for next time. It's thoughtful of you to think of staying hydrated while working on the lawn.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a mix of helpful and less helpful information regarding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 3 from the MEMORY directly align with the conversation about mowing the lawn, which is mentioned in the context. This provides a direct correlation and supports generating a relevant response. Sentence 6 also ties into the context slightly by emphasizing the familiarity between the neighbors. However, sentences 2, 4, and 5 introduce new information that is not directly supported or referenced in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as both neighbors enjoying being outside, suggestions about having extra water, and plans to mow together. While these could build on the dynamics between the neighbors, they do not clearly correlate with the current topic of conversation, thus providing less direct aid to future responses. The memories are phrased naturally, but the level of direct usefulness to the current conversation in DIALOGUE CONTEXT is moderate."
