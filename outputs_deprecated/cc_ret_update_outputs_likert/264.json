    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today. Wife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that. Husband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you. Wife: You always go above and beyond, dear.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that make him happy outside of work and family life.\n2. Both the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful.\n3. The wife is glad to see the husband finding a sense of purpose and being happy.\n4. The husband enjoys being outside and loves the weather after being stuck indoors at work.\n5. The wife is supportive of her husband's hobbies and interests, such as playing the guitar.\n6. Husband values the supportive community of believers at church and appreciates having his wife by his side.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It brings me joy to create a cozy atmosphere for us to relax and unwind. It's those little touches that make our home feel special and filled with love.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some general information about the relationship between the husband and wife, but it lacks specific details directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the husband's enjoyment of making the apartment cozy could somewhat relate to MEMORY 2, which mentions the impact of little things, the MEMORY primarily focuses on broader aspects of their relationship and other activities. The MEMORY does not provide concrete information about the current conversation regarding lights and candles, nor does it offer specific development or causality that aligns closely with the dialogue. The sentences provide a vague sense of support and appreciation in their relationship, but not in a way that directly ties back to or enhances the understanding of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
