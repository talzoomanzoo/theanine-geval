Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, have you checked out my new blog? It's all about promoting under-the-radar artists.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A ended up taking Classmates B's advice and found success with it.\n2. Classmates B gave advice to Classmates A in the past that paid off.\n3. Classmates A was initially hesitant about following Classmates B's advice.\n4. Classmates B expresses a desire to see Classmates A happy and successful in life.\n5. Classmates B has been working and traveling since high school.\n6. Classmates A and B went to the same high school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about Classmates A and B's past interactions that could be relevant to generating a response. Sentences 1 and 2 show that Classmates A took advice from Classmates B, and it was beneficial. This could imply a trusting relationship or a sense of gratitude, which could inform Classmates A's current conversation about their blog. Sentence 3 mentions A's initial hesitation, which may contribute to the narrative of growth or change.\n\nHowever, not all sentences directly connect to the current topic of the blog about promoting artists. For instance, sentences 4, 5, and 6 provide background information on Classmates B's feelings, history, and relationship but are less directly relevant to the blog discussion. These bits of memory offer potentially useful context but do not directly relate to the specific topic at hand. The overall relevance and usefulness for the specific context of promoting under-the-radar artists could be stronger."
