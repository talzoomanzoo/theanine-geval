    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become? Neighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out? Neighbors A: Yes, I go to the gym every day and lift weights. It's been really helping me build muscle. Neighbors B: That's great to hear! It reminds me of the time when you apologized to me for the way you treated me. Neighbors A: Yes, I realized that I needed to take responsibility for my actions and I didn't want to make the same mistake again. Neighbors B: It's always important to own up to our mistakes. It's like when you forgot your backpack in high school and had to deal with the consequences.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A apologized to Neighbors B for their behavior and admitted to being wrong.\n2. Neighbors B appreciates Neighbors A's handy skills.\n3. Neighbor A noticed some wood near their backyard and asked Neighbor B if they had seen it too.\n4. Neighbors A and B emphasize the importance of taking care of trees and the environment for future generations.\n5. Neighbors A values double-checking before leaving the house.\n6. Neighbors A is good at fixing things, particularly electronics.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, that was a tough lesson to learn. It's really important to double-check everything before leaving the house, just like how we need to be mindful of our impact on the environment for future generations.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides a mix of relevant and less relevant information in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. Sentence 1 directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as Neighbors B mentions the past apology from Neighbors A. This is a helpful piece of information as it ties directly into the conversation.\n2. Sentence 2 is somewhat relevant because it gives insight into Neighbors B's appreciation for Neighbors A, which can add context to their relationship. However, it's not directly tied to the current dialogue.\n3. Sentences 3, 4, 5, and 6 are not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as they pertain to different topics or skills not mentioned in the current conversation. However, they are naturally phrased and provide potential background information about the interests or values of the neighbors, which might be useful for understanding their dynamic in future interactions.\n\nOverall, while there is some helpful information connecting to the dialogue, a significant portion of the MEMORY details unrelated topics, albeit in a naturally phrased manner. This mixed relevance justifies a middle-ground score."
