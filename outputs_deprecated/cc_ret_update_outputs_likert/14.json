Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends. Mentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections. Mentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here. Mentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n2. Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process.\n3. The Mentee has been offered a job and has decided to take the job in the city.\n4. The Mentee weighed the pros and cons of each option before deciding on the job in the city.\n5. Mentor emphasizes the importance of self-care for dealing with challenges.\n6. Mentee agreed to go back to the store to make things right and expressed gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I guess you're right, Mentor. I should try to put myself out there more and explore different opportunities to meet new people. Thanks for the advice.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some potentially helpful background information, such as the fact that the Mentee is in a new city due to a job they decided to take (points 3 and 4). This could be relevant to understanding their current situation. However, most of the sentences in the MEMORY either do not directly relate to the context of feeling lonely (e.g., points 2 and 6) or are too general (e.g., point 1), failing to provide a clear development or connected narrative that can assist greatly in generating an appropriate response. Additionally, while the Mentor emphasizes self-care (point 5), it isn't directly related to the current conversation context about making new connections. The MEMORY's structure doesn't clearly build a narrative or connections useful to the current dialogue, thus limiting its helpfulness."
