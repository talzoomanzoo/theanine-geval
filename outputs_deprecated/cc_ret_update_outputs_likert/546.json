Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as evidenced by their conversation about their respective experiences.\n2. Classmates A and B are both keeping up with the homework in their math class.\n3. Classmates A enjoys reminiscing about childhood memories, particularly about playing on swings and making music with friends.\n4. Classmates B finds it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after a conversation they had about following dreams.\n5. Classmates A and B are discussing beverage choices, with A considering between Coke and Sprite.\n6. Classmates A finds pursuing music rewarding and is passionate about it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response to Classmates A's question. The following sentences are relevant and aid in crafting a response: \n\n1. Sentence 1 indicates that Classmates A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship, which is pertinent to A's inquiry about B's well-being. \n2. Sentence 4 shows a connection in a previous conversation where Classmates A pursued music, which B finds awesome. This could influence how Classmates A might expect B to share positive feelings or encouragement. \n3. Sentence 3 mentions Classmates A enjoys reminiscing, which may align with exchanging emotions or experiences, relevant to discussing feelings.\n4. Sentence 6 is relevant because it talks about Classmates A's passion for music, which could be related to their current emotional state.\n\nThe other sentences, such as 2 and 5, are not directly related to the question about feelings, but they are phrased naturally and show some interaction and context between the participants. Overall, the MEMORY helps capture the context of their interactions, providing a good backdrop for generating a supportive and relevant response."
