Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now! Neighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A made a big career change recently and is much happier now.\n2. Neighbors A took the leap to make a change and is glad they did.\n3. Neighbors A and B had a conversation a couple of years ago about needing a change.\n4. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's decision and admires the courage it took.\n5. Neighbors A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship.\n6. Neighbor A mentions seeing a UFO and wants to discuss it with Neighbor B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I took a big risk and invested in a startup that turned out to be a huge success. It was definitely a leap of faith, but it paid off big time!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant background information that can aid in generating a proper response for the language model given the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 2, and 3 establish that Neighbors A has made significant life changes leading to greater happiness, suggesting possible financial success that aligns with becoming a millionaire. Sentences 4 and 5 illustrate the support and encouragement from Neighbors B, indicating a relationship dynamic that would likely lead to a positive interaction in the current conversation. These points are naturally structured and demonstrate the development (e.g., career change and support) between the speakers. Sentence 6 is unrelated to the current context but is phrased in such a way that the language model can easily distinguish it as not directly useful for this interaction. Overall, while not all sentences are perfectly aligned with the millionaire revelation, they are cohesively phrased regarding past interactions."
