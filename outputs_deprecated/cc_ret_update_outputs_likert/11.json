Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process.\n2. The Mentee has been offered a job and has decided to take the job in the city.\n3. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n4. The Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process.\n5. Mentee agreed to go back to the store to make things right and expressed gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n6. Mentee feels like they are running out of time and is worried about the upcoming SAT.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's completely understandable to feel that way, especially when you're in a new environment. Making new friends takes time, but I'm sure you'll find your place soon. In the meantime, remember that I'm here for you whenever you need to talk.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information regarding the Mentee's situation, such as feeling overwhelmed (like in sentence 1) and making decisions about moving to the city (sentence 2). However, it lacks specific details directly related to the current issue presented in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Although the information about the job decision (sentence 2) is somewhat related as it explains why the Mentee is in a new city, the rest of the memories do not directly aid the language model in understanding or responding to the current feelings of loneliness expressed by the Mentee. Furthermore, the development of the relationship between the Mentee and the Mentor is not clearly outlined in terms of how to address this new concern. The memory lacks clear connections or causality concerning the present situation, reducing its helpfulness for generating a relevant response."
