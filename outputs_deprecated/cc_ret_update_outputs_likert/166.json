Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Thank you for finding my glasses for me, Mentor. I always seem to misplace them. Mentor: Not a problem, Mentee. I'm glad I could help.  Mentee: This actually reminds me of when I was struggling with substance abuse. I would often lose things or forget where I put things because of my drinking. It's amazing how much clearer my mind is now that I'm sober. Mentor: That's a great observation, Mentee. Sobriety can definitely improve your cognitive abilities and overall wellbeing. It's amazing how much substance abuse can hold us back in life. Mentee: Yeah, it's definitely a difficult journey, but I'm grateful for the support systems I have in place. Like you, Mentor. Your experience and guidance have been invaluable to me. Mentor: I'm happy to be there for you, Mentee. It's been great seeing you grow and develop over the years.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor is proud of Mentee for making positive changes and taking control of their life.\n2. Mentor acknowledges Mentee's achievements and provides ongoing support and guidance.\n3. Mentee has a history of substance abuse but has been sober for a year.\n4. Mentee values living in the moment and staying focused on their sobriety and goals.\n5. Mentor is willing to share their knowledge with Mentee and help them achieve their goals.\n6. Mentee admires Mentor's success and wants to learn from them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant and helpful information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clearly presents the past interactions and dynamics between Mentor and Mentee. The sentences contribute to a better understanding of the relationship and provide contextual cues that would benefit language model responses. Specifically:\n- Sentence 1 captures Mentor's pride and the positive change in Mentee's life, which aligns with the supportive tone in the dialogue.\n- Sentence 2 reflects Mentor's consistent support, relevant to the ongoing dialogue.\n- Sentence 3 provides background on Mentee's substance abuse history and their sobriety, directly relating to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where sobriety is discussed.\n- Sentences 4 and 6 reflect Mentee's current focus and admiration for Mentor, providing context for their personal growth journey.\n- Sentence 5 highlights Mentor's readiness to help, consistent with the dialogue.\n\nWhile the MEMORY is not perfect and could benefit from slightly richer context or more explicit connections, it is nonetheless structured well and overall enhances the understanding of the dialogue."
