    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess. Classmates B: Wait, what? You cheated on your taxes? That's not okay. Classmates A: I know, I know. I was just really struggling financially and I thought I could get away with it. Classmates B: You can't just cheat and hope to never get caught. That's not how it works. Classmates A: Remember when we talked about me wanting to become a professional basketball player? Classmates B: Yeah, I remember. So, what does that have to do with cheating on your taxes?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A has a big dream of becoming a professional basketball player and works hard towards that goal.\n2. Classmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed.\n3. Classmate A is pursuing a dream of becoming a professional basketball player and is working at a grocery store to save up money for training.\n4.

    "raw_prediction": "I'm just saying that I've learned the hard way that taking shortcuts or cheating never leads to real success. I need to stay focused on my goals, work hard, and ask for help when I need it. I appreciate your support and understanding, especially during tough times like this.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information about Classmate A's aspiration to become a professional basketball player. This is relevant given that in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, Classmate A mentions their dream and refers back to past conversations about it. \n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful context about Classmate A's goals and efforts, such as working at a grocery store to save money for training, which gives insight into the financial struggles mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It demonstrates that Classmate A has been consistently focused on this dream and has support from Classmate B.\n\nWhile MEMORY effectively captures Classmate A's dreams and the supportive role of Classmate B, it lacks explicit connection to the main issue discussed in the dialogue: Classmate A's decision to cheat on taxes due to financial struggles. The MEMORY does not provide details or past interactions specifically related to these financial difficulties or any ethical discussions about dealing with them legally.\n\nOverall, MEMORY is somewhat helpful, especially in understanding the background and relationship dynamics between the two classmates, but lacks detailed connection to the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT related to the tax issue."
