Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I can't believe how honored I am to be part of our class. I feel like we have something special going on here. Classmates B:  You're right. Our class definitely has a unique energy about it. What do you think sets us apart from other classes? Classmates A:  I think it's our sense of community. We all support each other and work together to achieve our goals. Classmates B:  That's definitely a big factor. And I also think our class has a lot of diversity, which brings new perspectives and ideas to the table. Classmates A:  Yes, absolutely. I love hearing everyone's different viewpoints and experiences. It really helps us all grow and learn.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B complimented Classmates A on their suit and brought up a past conversation about feelings.\n2. Classmate B feels relieved that they can still be friends with Classmate A.\n3. Classmates A values their friendship with Classmates B and looks forward to wearing a black suit to a wedding reception.\n4. Classmate A has been hiding their feelings for Classmate B and finally confesses to being in love with them.\n5. Classmate A is disappointed when Classmate B does not feel the same way.\n6. Classmates A confessed their love for Classmates B, who does not feel the same way.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains information about a personal and emotional interaction between Classmate A and Classmate B, specifically around a confession of love and the eventual disappointment that Classmate B does not reciprocate those feelings. However, this MEMORY doesn't align closely with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on the unique and positive aspects of their class as a community. There is a lack of clear connection or relevance between the MEMORY and DIALOGUE CONTEXT that would assist in generating an appropriate next response. Although the MEMORY is about the past interactions between the same characters, it involves a very different subject matter (personal relationships vs. class dynamics). Additionally, the phrases within MEMORY are somewhat disjointed and focus on a single, unrelated past event without broad context. This makes it less helpful in deriving meaningful insights for the current dialogue about class characteristics and dynamics."
