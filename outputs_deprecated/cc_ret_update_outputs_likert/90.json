Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you. Classmates B: Oh really? What are they? Classmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n2. Classmate A and Classmate B enjoy singing karaoke together and look forward to future outings.\n3. Classmates A and B are open to meeting for coffee again in the future.\n4. Classmates A is social and enjoys meeting new people.\n5. Classmates A is looking forward to meeting up with Classmates B again after getting better sleep.\n6. Classmate B admires Classmate A's outgoing nature and wants to be more like them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context that may aid in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Several sentences hint at a positive and supportive relationship between Classmates A and B, which aligns with the proposed idea of working on a project together and potentially becoming business partners. For instance, memory items 1 and 6 imply encouragement and admiration, suggesting a potential basis for teamwork. Items 2 and 3 also indicate shared activities and openness to future meetings, supporting the collaborative theme in the dialogue. However, there is some information, such as in item 4 about Classmates A being social, and item 5 about better sleep, which does not clearly relate to the immediate context of business and project collaboration. Thus, while the MEMORY offers some relevant cues, not all entries are directly aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making the score a 3."
