    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become? Neighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out? Neighbors A: Yes, I go to the gym every day and lift weights. It's been really helping me build muscle. Neighbors B: That's great to hear! It reminds me of the time when you apologized to me for the way you treated me. Neighbors A: Yes, I realized that I needed to take responsibility for my actions and I didn't want to make the same mistake again. Neighbors B: It's always important to own up to our mistakes. It's like when you forgot your backpack in high school and had to deal with the consequences. Neighbors A: Definitely. It taught me to always be prepared and double-check everything. It's like how I make sure to tighten screws and wires when working on my computer. Neighbors B: It's all about being responsible and taking care of ourselves, just like how you take care of your physical health by working out.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A apologized to Neighbors B for their behavior and admitted to being wrong.\n2. Neighbors B appreciates Neighbors A's handy skills.\n3. Neighbors A values double-checking before leaving the house.\n4. Neighbors A and B emphasize the importance of taking care of trees and the environment for future generations.\n5. Neighbors A is good at fixing things, particularly electronics.\n6. Neighbor A noticed some wood near their backyard and asked Neighbor B if they had seen it too.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "And just like how we take care of ourselves, we should also take care of our surroundings for future generations, like the trees in our backyard. Have you noticed how much they've grown since we planted them together?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several points that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Neighbors A apologizing for their behavior and being good at fixing things. The point about Neighbors A double-checking before leaving the house is also relevant as it connects to the idea of being responsible and prepared, mentioned in the dialogue. However, there are some memory points that do not connect well with the current dialogue, such as the emphasis on taking care of trees and the environment for future generations, and the question about wood in the backyard. These points do not provide clear links to the conversation or cues that would help generate the next response. The MEMORY is fairly structured, but the lack of clear connection for some points reduces its overall helpfulness."
