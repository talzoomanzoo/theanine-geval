Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A suggests grabbing lunch together, showing an interest in spending more time with Classmates B.\n2. Classmates A and B have a good relationship, with Classmates A expressing admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor.\n3. Both Classmates A and B enjoy talking to each other and consider themselves great study partners.\n4. Classmates A and B are interested in biology and studying cells.\n5. Both Classmates A and B are open to exploring a romantic connection and are looking forward to getting to know each other better.\n6. Classmates A finds it refreshing to talk to someone genuinely interested in science and learning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've really enjoyed our conversations about biology and studying cells. Your intelligence and sense of humor always make our discussions so engaging.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several key points that are relevant to understanding the interaction between Classmates A and B in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 2, and 3, in particular, give context to their relationship, indicating a good rapport, mutual interests, and a potential for a deeper connection, which could be relevant if Classmates A is addressing a personal or relationship-related topic in their \"something important.\" Point 5 specifically highlights an openness to a romantic connection, providing a potential backdrop for the conversation. The MEMORY successfully conveys the connections and mutual interests between the speakers, which are important contextual cues. However, not all sentences are crucially relevant to the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT, preventing a perfect score. For example, while sentence 4 about their interest in biology and studying cells shows shared interest, it may not directly pertain to the pressing conversation. Overall, the MEMORY is quite helpful in informing potential dynamics at play in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but could be slightly more focused on the immediate topic at hand."
