    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind? Classmates A: I know about your affair with that other woman. Classmates B: What are you talking about? I don't have an affair with anyone. Classmates A: Don't lie to me! I saw you together at the restaurant last week. Classmates B: That was just a business meeting. We were discussing a potential collaboration on a music project. Classmates A: I don't believe you. You're just trying to cover it up. I'm going to tell everyone and ruin your career. Classmates B: Why are you doing this? I thought we were friends. Classmates A: I can't stand that you're a better singer than I am. I'm envious of your talent and success. Classmates B: That's not a reason to try and destroy my life. If you're feeling insecure about your own abilities, that's something you need to work on. Don't take it out on other people. Classmates A: I know, I know. I'm sorry,. I was wrong to even think about doing something like that. Can you forgive me?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B have a good relationship, with Classmates A expressing admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor.\n2. Both Classmates A and B enjoy talking to each other and consider themselves great study partners.\n3. Classmates A suggests grabbing lunch together, showing an interest in spending more time with Classmates B.\n4. Both Classmates A and B are open to exploring a romantic connection and are looking forward to getting to know each other better.\n5. Classmate A loves Lady Gaga's music and message of acceptance and inclusivity.\n6. Classmate B admires Classmate A's dedication and believes they have a knack for science.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Of course, I forgive you. It's okay to feel insecure sometimes, but let's support each other instead of tearing each other down. And hey, if you ever want to work on music together, I'd be happy to help you with your singing. Let's focus on building each other up.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides limited context relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While it helps paint a picture of Classmates A and B having a generally positive and amiable relationship, which adds depth to the confrontation narrative, it lacks specific information directly tied to the conversation about the alleged affair. The details about their admiration for each other's traits and potential interest in a romantic connection do not provide helpful clues for understanding the tension and allegations presented in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY also includes aspects unrelated to the immediate conflict, like liking Lady Gaga or a knack for science, which are not necessary for a language model to generate the next response about the betrayal and forgiveness in the dialogue. The MEMORY could be improved by including previous instances of jealousy, competition in singing, or interactions during the music project. While the relationship hints at complexity, the MEMORY does not explicitly or logically connect these elements to help address the crucial aspects of the dialogue."
