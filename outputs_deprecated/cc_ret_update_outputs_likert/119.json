    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I really enjoy being a carpenter. It's a very fulfilling job. Classmates B: That's great to hear! How did you get into carpentry? Classmates A: My dad was a carpenter, so I grew up around it. I started by helping him out when I was young, and then I began to really enjoy it myself. Classmates B: That's awesome that you were able to learn from your dad and turn it into a career. Have you done any big projects lately? Classmates A: Yeah, I just finished building a custom bookshelf for a client. It was a challenging project, but I'm really happy with how it turned out. Classmates B: That's impressive! You must have a lot of skill to be able to build something like that. Classmates A: Thanks! It definitely takes a lot of practice and attention to detail. But I find it really rewarding to see a finished product that I created with my own two hands.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B is supportive and encourages Classmates A in their business venture.\n2. Classmates A is attending a seminar on starting a business and is excited about applying that knowledge to future plans.\n3. Classmates A has had a business idea for a while and is now taking steps to make it a reality.\n4. Classmate B offers to support and potentially collaborate with Classmate A in the future.\n5. Classmates A is willing to work hard and learn the necessary strategies for business success.\n6. Classmates B mentions the importance of seeking advice from mentors and staying motivated and passionate about the business idea.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's clear that you have a real passion for carpentry, and that dedication shines through in your work. I'm glad to see you pursuing something you love. Keep honing your skills and taking on challenging projects - you're on the right track to success!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that is somewhat related to the themes of business and skill, which can be tied to Classmate A's profession as a carpenter as discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY's focus on business and entrepreneurship doesn't directly align with the specific conversation about carpentry, projects, and learning from one's father. The statements in MEMORY are broadly phrased and lack direct connection with the immediate topics in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT such as carpentry projects or craftsmanship challenges. Some statements could potentially offer contextual background if the conversation were to veer towards broader career development or business-related topics, but as it stands, the MEMORY does not provide precise and helpful cues for generating an immediate response to the given dialogue. Therefore, it scores a 2, indicating limited relevance and helpfulness."
