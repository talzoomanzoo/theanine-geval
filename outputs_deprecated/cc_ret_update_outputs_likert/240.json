    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that. Neighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset? Neighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore. Neighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it? Neighbors A: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end job. Neighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you considered looking for a new job? Neighbors A: I have, but with the current job market, it's really tough. Plus, I don't have a lot of experience in other fields.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\n2. Neighbors A wants to rearrange their living room and Neighbors B has experience with rearranging furniture.\n3. Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received.\n4. Neighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship as neighbors.\n5. Neighbors A is detail-oriented and strives for perfection.\n6. Neighbors B values reciprocity and acknowledges the mutual help between them as neighbors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I can imagine how tough that must be. Maybe you could explore some online courses or workshops to gain new skills and broaden your opportunities. I'm here to help if you need any advice or support in your job search.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some helpful information, mostly focusing on the supportive and understanding nature of Neighbors B, which is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around a support-based conversation, with Neighbors B trying to support Neighbors A through a tough work situation. Therefore, MEMORY's indication of Neighbors B's supportive nature (Statements 1 and 4) and the positive relationship between the neighbors are helpful in understanding their dynamic. However, other statements like the ones about rearranging furniture (Statement 2), detail orientation, or reciprocity (Statements 3, 5, and 6) are not directly related to the current context, nor do they provide concrete helpful cues for generating the next response in this dialogue. The MEMORY lacks cohesiveness, though each sentence is well-structured and conveys the development of their broader relationship. This earns it a middle score of 3."
