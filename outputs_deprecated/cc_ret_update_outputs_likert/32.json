Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water? Neighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for. Neighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit. Neighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water. Neighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it. Neighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again. Neighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower? Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work. Neighbors A: It was. But it was also a good workout. Neighbors B: I prefer to work out indoors where there's air conditioning. Neighbors A: Ha, I remember when I took off my jacket and put my feet up in your armchair. It was so warm that day. Neighbors B: Yeah, that was a hot day. I'm glad you felt comfortable in my home though. Neighbors A: You know, I really enjoy spending time with you. I want to get to know you even better.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\n2. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n3. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n4. Neighbor A enjoys spending time in Neighbor B's cozy home and wants to hang out more often.\n5. Neighbors B agrees that mowing the lawn is a lot of work but acknowledges the exercise it provides.\n6. Neighbors A and B plan to work on mowing the lawn together next time to make it easier and possibly discover more things in common.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I enjoy your company too. It's nice to have a good neighbor like you. Working on the lawn together next time sounds like a plan.",
    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY provides a reasonably helpful context for generating the next response in the dialogue. Although the MEMORY touches upon the themes discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as spending time outdoors and shared experiences, it lacks specificity in reflecting the emotional dynamics between the neighbors during the water-pushing incident and the lawn mowing conversation. \n\n- Sentence 1 is partially helpful as it references the shared activity of mowing the lawn but generalizes the context about enjoying outdoor activities.\n- Sentence 2 is slightly relevant since dialogue mentions feeling hot, but it does not encompass the joke incident.\n- Sentence 3 provides background on their relationship but could be more specific in helping generate the next dialogue.\n- Sentence 4 is relevant since it aligns with Neighbor A expressing a desire to spend more time together.\n- Sentence 5 accurately captures part of their conversation about a shared activity.\n- Sentence 6 introduces new information not relevant to the dialogue's current state.\n\nOverall, MEMORY captures some essential elements from their interaction but does not effectively detail their emotional exchange or the transition from an argument to reminiscing, which are central to the current dialogue context."
