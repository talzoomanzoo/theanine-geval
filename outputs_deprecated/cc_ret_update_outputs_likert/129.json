Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss! Co-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes. Co-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan. Co-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway. Co-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way. Co-workers B: And sometimes it is, but we all have different ideas and perspectives to bring to the table. Co-workers A: Okay, I see your point. I'll try to be more open-minded in the future. Co-workers B: That's all we can ask for. Remember that we're a team and we all have something valuable to contribute.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues.\n2. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.\n3. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value communication and understanding in relationships.\n4. Co-worker A strives to do their best in their work.\n5. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's competence and effort in their work.\n6. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B enjoy taking moments to connect with each other and find these moments make work more enjoyable.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information that could aid a language model in generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it highlights the dynamics of the relationship between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, mentioning their ability to work well together (sentences 1 and 3) and Co-worker B's acknowledgment of Co-worker A's work ethic (sentences 2 and 5). These aspects of their relationship could provide context for the open-mindedness and teamwork emphasized in the dialogue. However, several of the sentences, such as sentence 4 regarding Co-worker A's personal work ethic, don't directly relate to the context of the specific conversation. Moreover, while the sentences are generally well-structured and descriptive of the positive working relationship, they do not explicitly convey the development or causality in their interactions as shown in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, MEMORY provides moderate help but lacks specificity and direct connection to the dialogue provided."
