Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Thank you for finding my glasses for me, Mentor. I always seem to misplace them. Mentor: Not a problem, Mentee. I'm glad I could help.  Mentee: This actually reminds me of when I was struggling with substance abuse. I would often lose things or forget where I put things because of my drinking. It's amazing how much clearer my mind is now that I'm sober. Mentor: That's a great observation, Mentee. Sobriety can definitely improve your cognitive abilities and overall wellbeing. It's amazing how much substance abuse can hold us back in life. Mentee: Yeah, it's definitely a difficult journey, but I'm grateful for the support systems I have in place. Like you, Mentor. Your experience and guidance have been invaluable to me. Mentor: I'm happy to be there for you, Mentee. It's been great seeing you grow and develop over the years. Mentee: Speaking of growth, I've been really trying to live in the moment lately. It's been bringing me so much joy and fulfillment, and I feel more connected to the world around me. Mentor: That's fantastic, Mentee. Being present and mindful can do wonders for your mental health and overall satisfaction with life. Keep it up!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor is proud of Mentee for making positive changes and taking control of their life.\n2. Mentee values living in the moment and staying focused on their sobriety and goals.\n3. Mentor acknowledges Mentee's achievements and provides ongoing support and guidance.\n4. Mentee has a history of substance abuse but has been sober for a year.\n5. The Mentee is dedicated to their sobriety and believes incorporating yoga into their routine will benefit their mental and physical health.\n6. The Mentor encourages the Mentee to prioritize self-care and explore new ways to stay healthy and happy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I will, Mentor. I've also started incorporating yoga into my routine, and it's been such a positive addition. It helps me stay grounded and focused on my goals.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a significant amount of helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY includes key details such as the Mentee's history of substance abuse, their current focus on sobriety and personal growth, and the Mentor's role in providing support and encouragement. These aspects closely align with the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it easier for a language model to generate appropriate responses. Furthermore, the MEMORY captures the ongoing dynamic between the Mentor and Mentee, emphasizing their growth journey and commitment to self-improvement. The sentence structures in the MEMORY are clear and concise, offering valuable contextual cues without unnecessary complexity. However, the mention of incorporating yoga into the routine (point 5) does not directly connect with the current conversation but still fits within the Mentee's broader goals. Overall, the MEMORY effectively supports the contextual understanding needed for generating future dialogue, with room for slight improvement in contextual relevance."
