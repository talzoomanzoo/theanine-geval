Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn. Teacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation? Student: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle. Teacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time? Student: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then. Teacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going? Student: It's going pretty well. I started with French, but now I'm considering taking up Spanish and German too. I want to become more well-rounded. Teacher: That's a great goal. Have you thought about any specific ways you could use your language skills? Student: I would love to be able to travel more and speak with the locals in their native language. Maybe I could even teach my grandchildren some basic phrases. Teacher: Speaking of your grandchildren, how's your retirement planning going? Student: It's going well. I'm really looking forward to spending more time with them and taking them on fun trips. Teacher: That sounds like a great plan. Speaking of fun, remember when you scared me in the hallway a few days ago? Student: Oh, I'm so sorry about that. I was having a bad day and I shouldn't have taken it out on you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The student is studying French at college and plans on learning Spanish and German as well.\n2. The teacher speaks Spanish and French fluently.\n3. The student mentioned feeling stressed lately, which may have led to the outburst.\n4. The teacher and student have a positive and understanding relationship.\n5. The student once saved a kid from drowning and had a moment of yelling at the teacher in the past.\n6. The teacher advises the student on effective communication and problem-solving, emphasizing the importance of talking calmly and finding solutions together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's okay, I understand we all have tough days. Remember what we talked about before? Effective communication and problem-solving are key. Next time, let's find a solution together if you're feeling stressed.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures key points such as the student's language learning goals (studying French, planning to learn Spanish and German), which relates to their conversation about language study. It also includes the positive relationship between the student and teacher, which is illustrated in their cordial dialogue about retirement and language plans. The mention of the student's stress providing context for past behavior aligns with the student's apology for their outburst in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, some details, such as the student saving a kid from drowning, are not relevant to the current interaction, though they give a fuller picture of the student. Overall, MEMORY is structured in a way that highlights important developments and connections within the interactions, making it helpful in generating meaningful responses."
