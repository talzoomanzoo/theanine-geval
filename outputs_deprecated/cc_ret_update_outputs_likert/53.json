    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today? Co-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing. Co-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed. Co-workers B: That's really nice of you, but I don't want to burden you with my work. Co-workers A: It's not a burden if it's something I can do to support you. Plus, helping you out makes me feel good too. Co-workers B: You're right, thank you. You always go above and beyond to help me out.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\n2. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health.\n3. Co-worker A expressed gratitude for the horse that Co-worker B gave them, mentioning it brings joy and happiness.\n4. Co-worker A feels motivated about the future and is excited to work with Co-worker B.\n5. Co-worker B agrees that their skill sets complement each other well.\n6. Co-worker A values their health to continue working at their best.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information but is not structured in a way that clearly demonstrates the development of interactions between the co-workers in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n- Sentence 1 is incorrect and irrelevant as Co-worker A offers help to Co-worker B, not the other way around.\n- Sentence 2 partially relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as it suggests mutual support but lacks specific relevance to the conversation about workload.\n- Sentence 3 is not connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, introducing an unrelated element about horse gifting.\n- Sentence 4 shows Co-worker A's positive feelings but does not directly connect to the conversation about current workload and support.\n- Sentence 5 could relate to teamwork but is not explicitly linked to how they handle workload.\n- Sentence 6 reflects a concept (valuing health) that somewhat aligns with Co-worker B being supportive but is not specific to the context.\n\nThe MEMORY does provide a sense of mutual support and appreciation between the co-workers, which is relevant but lacks clarity and direct applicability to the specific conversation about managing a heavy workload and offering help. The connections could have been more explicitly aligned with the context to score higher."
