Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager! Co-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role. Co-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge. Co-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail. Co-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products. Co-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader? Co-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago. Co-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality. Co-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes. But it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Remember when I was really stressed about you not liking me? Co-workers B: Yeah, I remember. But we worked through it, didn't we? Co-workers A: We definitely did. And it taught me to just take things one step at a time, like I am with this new role. Co-workers B: Exactly, and I'm sure you'll apply that same mentality to your training as well. I remember you were really dedicated to it a couple of years ago.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n2. Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader.\n3. Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\n4. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n5. Co-worker B acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress.\n6. Co-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, that dedication really paid off. It's all about continuous improvement and growth. I'm excited to see where this new leadership role takes me and how I can contribute to the team.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information that can aid the language model in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, sentences 1, 3, and 6 are relevant because they highlight Co-worker A's long-standing aspirations and thoughts about leadership, which is a central theme in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 2 is partially relevant as it connects to Co-worker A taking on more responsibility, as discussed in the dialogue. However, sentences 4 and 5 are quite generic and do not offer new information that directly benefits understanding the dialogue context. The MEMORY, while somewhat helpful, could have been more robust in providing naturally connected sentences that clearly trace the development and progress of Co-workers A and Bâ€™s interactions, instead of repeating similar ideas in different phrasings (e.g., fantasies or aspirations). Additionally, the MEMORY could include more specific past interactions or shared experiences that are touched upon in the dialogue to enhance its helpfulness further."
