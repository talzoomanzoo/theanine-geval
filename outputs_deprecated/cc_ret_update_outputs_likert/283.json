Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn. Teacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The teacher and student have a positive and understanding relationship.\n2. The student felt rewarded by the experience and emphasized the importance of being aware of surroundings and acting quickly in emergencies.\n3. The student mentioned feeling stressed lately, which may have led to the outburst.\n4. The student once saved a kid from drowning and had a moment of yelling at the teacher in the past.\n5. The teacher expressed understanding and encouraged the student to seek help when needed.\n6. The teacher speaks Spanish and French fluently.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I do enjoy the sensation, but sometimes it's a bit too intense! It's like a wake-up call for my taste buds.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some general information about the past interactions between the teacher and the student, but only a few sentences are tangentially related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, the mention of the student's past experiences with stress (sentence 3) or feeling rewarded (sentence 2) might explain interest in spicy sensations as a form of stress relief or reward, but this connection is not explicit. Sentence 5 about the teacher encouraging the student to seek help, and sentence 1 about their positive relationship, provide context but are not directly relevant to the current dialogue about hot sauce. Sentence 6, regarding the teacher's language skills, has no relevance to the dialogue. Overall, while some sentences are structured naturally, they do not provide a helpful connection to the current dialogue context, leading to a low score."
