Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband enjoys being outside and loves the weather after being stuck indoors at work.\n2. The husband's faith has been strong lately, and he is involved in various church ministries.\n3. The husband feels happy and content being outside in the beautiful weather.\n4. The wife is glad to see the husband finding a sense of purpose and being happy.\n5. The husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that make him happy outside of work and family life.\n6. Both the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context mentions the husband hanging up lights and candles, suggesting an outdoor or decorative activity. The MEMORY contains relevant details about the husband's enjoyment of being outside and appreciating the weather (1, 3), which aligns with the context of him setting up lights and candles. It also highlights his happiness and contentment (3), and the wife's support in his activities (4, 5), which could be relevant for the language model to generate a supportive and positive response.\n\nThe MEMORY also includes details about his involvement in church ministries (2), which is not directly related to the context but might contribute to understanding his overall character. The sentence about both agreeing on the little things that make life meaningful (6) fits well with the small act of hanging up lights, providing additional contextual depth. Thus, the MEMORY is well-structured and clearly demonstrates causality, connection, and the development of past interactions, albeit with a few sentences that aren't directly connected to the current context."
