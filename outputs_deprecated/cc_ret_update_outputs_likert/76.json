    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret? Neighbors B: Of course, what's up? Neighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door. Neighbors B: Oh, why are you hiding from her? Neighbors A: She wants me to go to a family dinner tonight, but I'm too tired and just want to relax at home. Neighbors B: Maybe you should talk to her about it and let her know how you feel.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation.\n2. Neighbor B offers support and suggests planning a dinner to celebrate Neighbor A's new adventures in learning.\n3. Neighbors B is excited and supportive of Neighbors A's new ability.\n4. Neighbors B is open to trying new recipes and is excited to receive the chickpea curry recipe from Neighbors A.\n5. Neighbors A and B are discussing the idea of having telekinetic abilities.\n6. Neighbors A enjoys trying new things, like new recipes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I guess you're right. I should have an honest conversation with her about needing some time to relax. Thanks for the advice.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not align well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context is centered around a specific incident where Neighbors A is hiding from their mom to avoid going to a family dinner, whereas the MEMORY revolves around various aspects of cooking and excitement about new abilities, like telekinetic powers and culinary skills. While the MEMORY shows a dynamic relationship between the neighbors where they share interests (cooking) and support each other, it lacks a direct textual connection to the hiding situation or the family dinner topic. The information in MEMORY, focused on cooking and telekinesis, does not provide relevant contextual information or development needed for generating a meaningful continuation of this specific conversation. Thus, the MEMORY is not very helpful in guiding a response to the current dialogue context."
