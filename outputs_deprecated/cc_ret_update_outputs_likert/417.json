    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm really excited about finding a buyer for my product. I think it has a lot of potential. Neighbors B: That's great to hear, what kind of product is it? Neighbors A: It's a new type of workout equipment that's designed to be more efficient than traditional equipment. I've been working on it for months now and I really think it's going to take off. Neighbors B: Wow, that sounds interesting. Have you started looking for potential buyers? Neighbors A: Yes, I've been reaching out to various gyms and fitness centers to see if they'd be interested in carrying the product. I've even gotten some positive feedback from a few places. Neighbors B: That's awesome! I'm sure with your determination, you'll find the perfect buyer soon. Neighbors A: Thanks, I really appreciate your support. It's been a long road, but I'm confident that all my hard work will pay off. Neighbors B: Speaking of hard work, have you made any progress at your current job? I remember you were having some trouble with your boss.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B expresses a desire for Neighbors A to succeed and emphasizes the importance of treating others with respect and putting in effort at work.\n2. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's efforts to change and become a better version of themselves.\n3. Neighbors A is trying to improve their behavior at work and be a better colleague.\n4. Neighbors B appreciated Neighbors A's support during this difficult situation.\n5. Neighbors A and Neighbors B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as they enjoy having coffee and chatting together.\n6. Neighbors B suggests that Neighbors A's attitude and behavior at work may be the reason for their boss wanting to fire them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I've been making a conscious effort to improve my attitude and behavior at work. I've been more proactive in communicating with my colleagues and taking on additional responsibilities. I believe it's starting to make a positive impact, and I'm hoping to turn things around with my boss.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically regarding the relationship between Neighbors A and B and Neighbors A's challenges at work, which relates to Neighbors B's question about Neighbors A's job progress. However, the MEMORY lacks clear, structured sentences that directly relate to Neighbors A's current situation with the workout equipment and the search for buyers. Additionally, some sentences in the MEMORY, like those about having coffee and supporting each other during difficult situations, do not directly contribute to generating a next response in the given context. Therefore, while the MEMORY provides some context about their relationship and Neighbors A's work issues, it does not comprehensively encapsulate past interactions relevant to the current topic of product development and selling, hence the score of 2."
