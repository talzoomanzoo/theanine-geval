Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind? Classmates A: I know about your affair with that other woman. Classmates B: What are you talking about? I don't have an affair with anyone. Classmates A: Don't lie to me! I saw you together at the restaurant last week. Classmates B: That was just a business meeting. We were discussing a potential collaboration on a music project. Classmates A: I don't believe you. You're just trying to cover it up. I'm going to tell everyone and ruin your career. Classmates B: Why are you doing this? I thought we were friends. Classmates A: I can't stand that you're a better singer than I am. I'm envious of your talent and success. Classmates B: That's not a reason to try and destroy my life. If you're feeling insecure about your own abilities, that's something you need to work on. Don't take it out on other people. Classmates A: I know, I know. I'm sorry,. I was wrong to even think about doing something like that. Can you forgive me? Classmates B: Of course, but you need to promise me that you won't let your jealousy and spite get in the way of our friendship again. We're supposed to support each other, not tear each other down.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B have a good relationship, with Classmates A expressing admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor.\n2. Both Classmates A and B enjoy talking to each other and consider themselves great study partners.\n3. Classmates A suggests grabbing lunch together, showing an interest in spending more time with Classmates B.\n4. Both Classmates A and B are open to exploring a romantic connection and are looking forward to getting to know each other better.\n5. Classmate B admires Classmate A's dedication and believes they have a knack for science.\n6. Classmate A loves Lady Gaga's music and message of acceptance and inclusivity.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains information about the general relationship between Classmates A and B, such as their admiration for each other's qualities, their interest in spending time together, and their potential romantic interest. However, it does not provide specific information relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around a misunderstanding and conflict regarding an alleged affair. The MEMORY does not mention any conflict or previous tension, nor does it highlight previous interactions that would help explain or provide context to the current conflict. The mentions of their good relationship and admiration do not help the language model generate a response to the current situation as presented in the context. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions unrelated details, such as Classmate A's love for Lady Gaga's music, which do not contribute to understanding or resolving the current dialogue scenario. Overall, there is a lack of clear development or causality between the past interactions detailed in the MEMORY and the current situation."
