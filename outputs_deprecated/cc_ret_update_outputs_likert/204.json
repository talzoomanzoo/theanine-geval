Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager! Co-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role. Co-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge. Co-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail. Co-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.

Co-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality. Co-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes.

Co-workers A: We definitely did. And it taught me to just take things one step at a time, like I am with this new role. Co-workers B: Exactly, and I'm sure you'll apply that same mentality to your training as well. I remember you were really dedicated to it a couple of years ago. Co-workers A: Oh yeah, I still try to keep up with it whenever I can. It's important to stay physically and mentally fit, especially with this new job.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n2. Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\n3. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n4. Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader.\n5.

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! Keeping up with your training will definitely help you stay focused and balanced in your new role as a product manager. Your dedication and commitment to personal growth have always been admirable.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Co-worker A's aspirations and growth towards becoming a leader, which aligns with the current conversation about Co-worker A's promotion to product manager. Sentences 1, 3, and 6 are particularly helpful as they highlight Co-worker A's past aspirations and Co-worker B's acknowledgment of A's growth and progress, which directly connects to the dialogue. However, the MEMORY could be improved by providing more structured and detailed contextual information, especially regarding past interactions or events that led to this point in Co-worker Aâ€™s career, to be more beneficial for generating a response. Additionally, there is some redundancy in the MEMORY, with multiple sentences reiterating similar points about Co-worker A's leadership aspirations, which limits the variety of useful context clues. Overall, while MEMORY is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it could benefit from a more comprehensive and varied set of details."
