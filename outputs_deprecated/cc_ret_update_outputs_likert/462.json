Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind? Classmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you. Classmates B: Oh, really? Classmates A: Yes, really. I know we've been friends for a while now, but I feel like there may be something more between us. Classmates B: Hmm, I never thought about it that way. But I can’t deny that we have a great connection. Classmates A: Exactly! I just feel like we could be more than just friends. If it's something you're open to, of course. Classmates B: I get what you’re saying,. And to be honest, I’ve had similar thoughts lately. I’m definitely open to exploring this. Classmates A: I’m so relieved to hear that. I was worried that I might be crossing a line by expressing my feelings. Classmates B: No, not at all. I’m glad you did. It takes courage to express your true feelings.  Classmates A: Yeah, I guess it does. It’s just that I’ve been hurt before, and I don’t want to lose you as a friend too. Classmates B: I understand your concerns,. but I think we can make this work. We've already built a strong foundation of friendship, which is important for any relationship. Classmates A: That’s true. I feel like we can take this in any direction that we want. Classmates B: Definitely. We can take our time, explore our feelings, and see where it all leads.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B are close and have a level of trust between them.\n2. Classmate A recalls a moment where they admired Classmate B's courage and strength in sharing a secret, showing their supportive and compassionate nature.\n3. Classmates B feels relieved to have someone to confide in about the secret.\n4. Classmates A offered help and support to Classmates B.\n5. Classmates A and B have had a previous positive interaction in a coffee shop where Classmates A rubbed Classmates B's neck, providing relaxation.\n6. Classmates A discovered a secret that Classmates B has been keeping.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides helpful contextual information that is beneficial in generating a proper next response for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY details past interactions and sentiments between Classmates A and B that align with the ongoing conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, in which they discuss their feelings and mutual connection.\n\n1. Sentences 1, 2, and 3 are particularly relevant as they highlight the existing close relationship and mutual trust between the classmates, which matches the context of discussing their feelings and willingness to develop a deeper relationship.\n2. Sentence 4 indicates Classmate A's supportive role, aligning with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Classmate A expresses concern about losing the friendship.\n3. Sentence 5 offers insight into a previous positive experience, enhancing the understanding of their bond.\n4. Sentence 6, although it discusses a separate secret, contributes to the overall narrative of trust and sharing, but it is less directly relevant to the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nOverall, while most of the MEMORY closely ties with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and provides valuable insights, sentence 6 is somewhat less relevant to this context, which is why the score is not a full 5. However, the information provided is well-structured and naturally phrased, helping the language model understand the dynamics between the speakers."
