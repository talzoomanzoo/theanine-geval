Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today. Wife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that. Husband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you. Wife: You always go above and beyond, dear. Husband: It's the little things that count, right? Wife: Definitely. Speaking of little things, do you remember when you told me about catching the bus just in time a few months ago? Husband: Oh yes, I remember. I was so relieved I didn't have to wait in the cold for the next one. Wife: It's amazing how small moments like that can make such a big difference in our day, isn't it? Husband: Absolutely. It's the small moments that make life worth living. Wife: And speaking of living, you mentioned a while back how involved you are in the different ministries at church. Husband: Yes, I'm so grateful for the community and support I've found there. It's helped me grow in my faith so much. Wife: It's wonderful to see you so passionate and dedicated to something you believe in. Husband: And I'm grateful for your support and encouragement in it all.\n\nMEMORY:\n1.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that is relevant and helpful for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences in the MEMORY accurately reflect the key themes in the dialogue, such as the importance of small moments and the husband's involvement in church activities. The MEMORY provides a cohesive narrative of the couple's interactions and sentiments, such as mutual appreciation and support, which can guide the generation of a contextually appropriate response. The information is naturally structured, making it easy for the language model to identify important cues related to the dialogue."
