Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today. Wife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that. Husband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you. Wife: You always go above and beyond, dear. Husband: It's the little things that count, right? Wife: Definitely. Speaking of little things, do you remember when you told me about catching the bus just in time a few months ago? Husband: Oh yes, I remember. I was so relieved I didn't have to wait in the cold for the next one.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful.\n2. The wife mentions that the husband had to run to catch the bus a couple of years ago.\n3. The wife is glad to see the husband finding a sense of purpose and being happy.\n4. The husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that make him happy outside of work and family life.\n5. The husband enjoys being outside and loves the weather after being stuck indoors at work.\n6. The husband had to run to catch the bus this morning but made it on time, finding the experience exhilarating.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's those small victories that can really make your day, right? Like when you made it on time this morning after running for the bus. It must have felt like a little accomplishment.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically regarding the husband's experience of running to catch the bus. However, there are discrepancies such as the timeline (\"a couple of years ago\" vs \"a few months ago\") and the event (\"this morning\" vs a few months ago\"), which can cause confusion. Other sentences in the MEMORY, such as those concerning feelings of purpose and happiness, contribute to general character development but do not directly support the current dialogue. Therefore, while some elements are helpful, the MEMORY lacks coherence in the timeline and mostly provides general context rather than direct support for generating the next response in the conversation."
