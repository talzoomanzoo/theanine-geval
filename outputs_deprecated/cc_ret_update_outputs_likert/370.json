Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message. Co-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident. Co-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows. Co-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive. Co-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right. Co-workers B: Speaking of convincing people, have you ever been in a physical altercation before? Co-workers A: Yes, unfortunately. But that doesn't mean I'm a danger to people. I just don't back down from a fight when I'm standing up for what's right. Co-workers B: That's understandable. Speaking of standing up for what's right, do you remember when you asked Karen for money and she was hesitant at first? Co-workers A: Yeah, I remember. But she eventually gave me the cash, and I was able to take care of what I needed to.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs.\n2. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument.\n3. Co-worker A has experience dealing with challenging clients and emphasizes the importance of communication and setting expectations.\n4. Co-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\n5. Co-worker B mentions that Co-worker A's reputation may have influenced Karen's hesitation to give them money.\n6. Co-worker A believes their evidence is more compelling than the opposing side's evidence.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's possible that Karen was just cautious due to your reputation. Your persistence and dedication to your beliefs can be intimidating to some, but in the end, your evidence speaks for itself.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and offers helpful background for generating a response. Several sentences accurately reflect past interactions or details hinted at in the dialogue, such as Co-worker A's skill in defending their beliefs (#1), using evidence in their arguments (#2), and successfully convincing someone (#5). The mention of evidence being crucial to Co-worker A and involving statistics (#4) supports the context where facts and figures are used to persuade the audience. The MEMORY is structured to present a coherent understanding of Co-worker A's traits and skills, which can guide the response. However, some sentences (like #3, dealing with challenging clients) are less directly relevant to the current interaction but still fit naturally within the context. Overall, the MEMORY provides a good amount of helpful information with clear connections and relevancy to the dialogue context."
