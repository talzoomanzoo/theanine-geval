    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, have you ever tried to imagine what it would be like to think like someone else? Mentor: Yes, I have. It's a great way to better understand and empathize with others. Mentee: That's exactly what I thought. I've been trying to imagine what personY is thinking lately. It's been helping me to understand their perspective a bit better. Mentor: That's a great approach. Putting ourselves in someone else's shoes can help us see things from a different angle and see where they're coming from. Mentee: Exactly. And it also helps me to be more compassionate towards them. I think it's important for us to be more understanding and supportive of each other, especially in difficult times.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor became a mentor to help others going through similar situations.\n2. Mentee wants to make a positive impact in people's lives and is grateful for Mentor's support.\n3. Mentee agrees to try the advice and express gratitude towards Mentor.\n4. Mentor encourages Mentee to approach teaching religion with an open mind and heart.\n5. Mentee has been thinking about helping others who may be in abusive cults.\n6. Mentee is taking the idea of teaching religion seriously and wants to make a positive impact on people's lives.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, empathy and compassion go a long way in building stronger connections with others. It's wonderful to see your dedication to understanding and supporting those around you. Keep up the great work!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that can aid in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 2 provide context about the Mentor and Mentee's motivations, aligning with the conversation about understanding and support. Sentence 5 also connects to the dialogue as it shows the Mentee's compassionate concern for others, which aligns with the ongoing conversation. However, sentences 4 and 6 about teaching religion, while naturally phrased, do not directly relate to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding empathy and understanding others' perspectives. Overall, the memories are somewhat helpful but contain a mix of relevant and less relevant information for the context."
