Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret? Neighbors B: Of course, what's up?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is excited and supportive of Neighbors A's new ability.\n2. Neighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation.\n3. Neighbors A and B are discussing the idea of having telekinetic abilities.\n4. Neighbors A and B share a dream of developing telekinetic abilities together in the future.\n5. Neighbors A is overwhelmed but also excited about their new ability.\n6. Neighbors A enjoys trying new things, like new recipes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I think I might have developed telekinetic abilities. It's been overwhelming but also incredibly exciting.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides a moderate amount of helpful information for a language model representing Parent to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. There are some sentences within the MEMORY that establish a previous relationship between Neighbors A and B, such as sharing dreams and discussing telekinetic abilities (sentences 3 and 4), which could relate to the secret that Neighbor A wants to share if it involves telekinesis. Additionally, emotions and interests are highlighted (sentences 1, 2, and 5), which helps set the tone for their interactions. Overall, though some of these memories might not directly relate to the secret in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, they are naturally phrased and give a sense of ongoing interaction between the two, demonstrating some relevancy and development of events. However, the MEMORY lacks specific narrative structure linking all memories as a cohesive past conversation, thus receiving a score of 3."
