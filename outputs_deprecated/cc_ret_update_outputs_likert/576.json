    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. Neighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off. Neighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks? Neighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else. Neighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location? Neighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home. Neighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become. Neighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n2. Neighbor A and Neighbor B discuss organizing a community event to make a positive impact and appreciate the beauty of their city.\n3. Neighbors A enjoys taking care of flowers and finds it calming.\n4. Neighbor B is against Neighbor A's idea, emphasizing the ethical and legal implications.\n5. Neighbors A had help from friends in building the new house.\n6. Neighbor A considers Neighbor B a great neighbor and wanted to do something special for them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains sentences that provide some insight into Neighbor A and Neighbor B's previous interactions, but they lack significant relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Most of the MEMORY sentences do not relate directly to the issue of procrastination or suggest methods for overcoming it, both of which are central to the current conversation. While the MEMORY mentions shared activities like organizing a community event or building a house (which showcase some context of their relationship), these are not directly helpful for generating a response to the discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about productivity. Additionally, the sentences in the MEMORY do not naturally flow in a way that highlights causality or a clear progression of past interactions connected to the current dialogue topic, limiting their utility for crafting an appropriate continuation of the conversation."
