Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A.\n2. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n3. Co-workers A and B have worked together on a big story in the past.\n4. Co-worker B points out that Co-worker A doesn't always consider how their actions can affect others.\n5. Co-worker A is trying to be more conscious of how their actions impact others and avoid causing problems for anyone else.\n6. Co-worker A appreciates Co-worker B's support and plans to perform in the final round of the competition.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY includes relevant information about the relationship between Co-workers A and B, which could be useful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 2, and 6 highlight the supportive nature of Co-worker B towards Co-worker A, which can be helpful for crafting a response that aligns with their dynamic. Sentence 3 provides context about their past collaboration on a big story, but it's not directly connected to the current invitation for lunch. Sentences 4 and 5 are about Co-worker A's self-awareness and consideration for others, which might be useful context but aren't directly relevant to the lunch invitation. Overall, while the MEMORY includes useful relationship dynamics, the specific details are not directly tied to the lunch invitation, reducing its overall helpfulness slightly."
