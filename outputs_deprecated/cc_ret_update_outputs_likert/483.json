Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately. Classmates B: Why is that? Classmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically. Classmates B: That's a good goal to have. Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra? Classmates A: Definitely. I feel like I'm able to break down problems and analyze them more effectively. Classmates B: It's always rewarding when hard work pays off. Classmates A: Yes it is. It reminds me of when I proved my brother wrong in that race. I was so determined to win and it paid off in the end. Classmates B: It's great to see that determination and hard work lead to success in different areas of life. Classmates A: And even when I felt that pain in my arm, I waited and it eventually went away.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness.\n2. Classmates B emphasizes the importance of enjoying the journey and effort put in, not just focusing on winning.\n3. Classmates B brings up a past event where Classmates A beat their brother in a race, highlighting their competitive nature.\n4. Classmates A is competitive and recently beat their brother in a race.\n5. Classmates A expresses gratitude for the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n6. Classmates A reminisces about a past race with their brother and a conversation with Tyler about a personal issue.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that can aid in generating an appropriate next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The mention of Classmates A beating their brother in a race (points 3 and 4) aligns with Classmates A's reflection in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about determination and success in different aspects of life. This connection between past interactions and the current conversation helps in understanding Classmates A's character and motivation. Additionally, Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination, which is evident in the ongoing dialogue.\n\nHowever, there are parts of the MEMORY that do not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, like Classmates B emphasizing enjoying the journey (point 2) and Classmates A expressing gratitude (point 5), which are not evident in the context provided. Additionally, point 6 about reminiscing with a conversation with Tyler is not connected to the current dialogue. While these points are naturally phrased, they do not clearly demonstrate causality or relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, thus not contributing to a higher score. Overall, the MEMORY contains useful information but lacks full coherence and relevance to score higher."
