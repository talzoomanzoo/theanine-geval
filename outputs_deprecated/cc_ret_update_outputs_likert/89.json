Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you. Classmates B: Oh really? What are they?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n2. Classmate A and Classmate B enjoy singing karaoke together and look forward to future outings.\n3. Classmates A is social and enjoys meeting new people.\n4. Classmates A is looking forward to meeting up with Classmates B again after getting better sleep.\n5. Classmate B admires Classmate A's outgoing nature and wants to be more like them.\n6. Classmates A and B are open to meeting for coffee again in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been thinking about joining a local choir group to pursue my passion for singing. I feel like it's time to take a step towards something I love.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains several relevant and naturally phrased sentences that provide helpful contextual information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 5, and 6 illustrate the supportive and aspiring nature of the relationship between Classmates A and B, which could be relevant for generating a response to Classmates A's exciting plans for the future. Sentence 2 offers insight into their shared activities, indicating a pleasant and open relationship, which is beneficial for understanding their dynamic. Sentence 4 suggests a possibility for future interaction, aligning with the context of future plans. However, sentence 3, while naturally phrased, is a more general characteristic of Classmate A and less immediately relevant to the discussion at hand. Overall, MEMORY effectively provides relevant and structured information, but not all elements are directly applicable to the present dialogue context."
