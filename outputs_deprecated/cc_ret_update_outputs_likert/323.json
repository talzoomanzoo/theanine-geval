Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today? Co-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there? Co-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done. Co-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded. Co-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out. Co-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends? Co-workers A: Ugh, don't remind me. That was such a disaster. Co-workers B: It was definitely not one of your finest moments. But it's good to see that you're being responsible now and taking care of things like sending packages. Co-workers A: Thanks. I'm trying to be more responsible and reliable these days.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides.\n2. Co-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides.\n3. Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits.\n4. Co-worker A is trying to improve their punctuality and cut back on drinking.\n5. Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions.\n6. Co-worker A has been successful in not being late to work for weeks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a cohesive and relevant background concerning Co-worker A's commitment to becoming more responsible and reliable, which is a key theme in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY outlines Co-worker A's attempts to improve their behavior and Co-worker B's awareness and concern about this, suggesting that these are recurring themes in their interactions. The MEMORY is structured in a way that naturally connects past conversations between the coworkers, such as Co-worker A's struggles and achievements in being responsible, which aligns with the context's mention of Co-worker A taking responsibility in sending a package. However, while the MEMORY contains relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it lacks a more detailed causal connection between specific events and decisions. Overall, MEMORY provides useful and relevant information for the language model to understand the dynamics between the coworkers, their past interactions, and the development of Co-worker A's personal growth, justifying a score of 4."
