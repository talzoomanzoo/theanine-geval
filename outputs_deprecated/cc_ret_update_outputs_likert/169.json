Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Thank you for finding my glasses for me, Mentor. I always seem to misplace them. Mentor: Not a problem, Mentee. I'm glad I could help.  Mentee: This actually reminds me of when I was struggling with substance abuse. I would often lose things or forget where I put things because of my drinking. It's amazing how much clearer my mind is now that I'm sober. Mentor: That's a great observation, Mentee. Sobriety can definitely improve your cognitive abilities and overall wellbeing. It's amazing how much substance abuse can hold us back in life. Mentee: Yeah, it's definitely a difficult journey, but I'm grateful for the support systems I have in place. Like you, Mentor. Your experience and guidance have been invaluable to me. Mentor: I'm happy to be there for you, Mentee. It's been great seeing you grow and develop over the years. Mentee: Speaking of growth, I've been really trying to live in the moment lately. It's been bringing me so much joy and fulfillment, and I feel more connected to the world around me. Mentor: That's fantastic, Mentee. Being present and mindful can do wonders for your mental health and overall satisfaction with life. Keep it up! Mentee: I definitely will, Mentor. And thanks again for finding my glasses. Your help means a lot to me. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor is proud of Mentee for making positive changes and taking control of their life.\n2. Mentor acknowledges Mentee's achievements and provides ongoing support and guidance.\n3. Mentee values living in the moment and staying focused on their sobriety and goals.\n4. Mentee has a history of substance abuse but has been sober for a year.\n5. The Mentor encourages the Mentee to prioritize self-care and explore new ways to stay healthy and happy.\n6. Mentor is willing to share their knowledge with Mentee and help them achieve their goals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides a comprehensive and relevant summary of important aspects of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which would greatly assist a language model in generating an appropriate response. Each sentence in the MEMORY is connected to the ongoing dialogue and reflects the key themes and developments of the conversation. For example, the Mentor's pride in the Mentee's positive changes (Sentence 1) and acknowledgment of the Mentee's achievements and support (Sentence 2) directly relate to the Mentee's reflections on their journey and growth. Additionally, Sentence 3 captures the Mentee's focus on living in the moment, which is a central point of the current dialogue. Sentences about the Mentee's past struggles and sobriety (Sentence 4) and the Mentor's commitment to supporting the Mentee's wellbeing (Sentences 5 and 6) encapsulate the context of their relationship and the supportive dynamic established throughout their interaction. Even the additional supportive encouragements in the MEMORY are phrased naturally and can be easily identified as beneficial to the conversation development. Overall, the MEMORY demonstrates a clear development of the relationship and conversation, fulfilling the criterion for a high score effectively."
