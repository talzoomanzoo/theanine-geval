Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager! Co-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role. Co-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge. Co-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail. Co-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products. Co-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader? Co-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago. Co-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality. Co-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes. But it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Remember when I was really stressed about you not liking me? Co-workers B: Yeah, I remember. But we worked through it, didn't we? Co-workers A: We definitely did. And it taught me to just take things one step at a time, like I am with this new role.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n2. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n3. Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader.\n4. Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\n5. Co-worker B acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress.\n6. Co-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, taking things one step at a time is key. You've come a long way, and I have no doubt that you'll handle this new challenge with the same determination and grace as you did before.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information about Co-worker A's aspirations and growth, which are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT since the conversation focuses on Co-worker A's recent promotion and leadership ambitions. Sentences such as \"Co-worker B acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress\" align with the part of the dialogue where Co-worker B congratulates Co-worker A and expresses confidence in their leadership abilities. However, several sentences in MEMORY are repetitive (e.g., Co-worker A's fantasy of being a great leader is mentioned multiple times) and lack detailed structure that could better illustrate the development of interactions and causality. Consequently, the MEMORY is relatively helpful but could be improved by eliminating redundancy and providing more connected and developmental information."
