Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately. Classmates B: Why is that? Classmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically. Classmates B: That's a good goal to have. Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra? Classmates A: Definitely. I feel like I'm able to break down problems and analyze them more effectively. Classmates B: It's always rewarding when hard work pays off. Classmates A: Yes it is. It reminds me of when I proved my brother wrong in that race. I was so determined to win and it paid off in the end. Classmates B: It's great to see that determination and hard work lead to success in different areas of life.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness.\n2. Classmates B emphasizes the importance of enjoying the journey and effort put in, not just focusing on winning.\n3. Classmates B brings up a past event where Classmates A beat their brother in a race, highlighting their competitive nature.\n4. Classmates A is competitive and recently beat their brother in a race.\n5. Classmates A expresses gratitude for the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n6. Classmate A and Classmate B are classmates.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures the elements of acknowledgment and support that Classmates B provides to Classmates A, which are consistent with the ongoing dialogue. \n\n1. Sentence 1 is relevant as it connects with Classmates B's responses in the context, showing acknowledgment of Classmates A's determination.\n2. Sentence 3, and to some extent Sentence 4, are useful as they directly relate to the specific event mentioned in the dialogue about the brother's race. This enhances the understanding of Classmates A's competitiveness and determination, which are relevant traits discussed.\n3. Sentence 5 adds a layer of relationship context between Classmates A and B, which subtly supports the context of encouragement and friendship.\n4. Sentence 6 offers a basic identification which is not directly influential to the response generation in this dialogue but provides a structural understanding.\n\nHowever, Sentence 2 does not align well with the specific conversation points in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as there wasn't a focus on enjoying the journey itself highlighted in the provided context. Overall, the MEMORY provides a mixture of relevant and slightly disconnected information but is presented clearly enough for a language model to use selectively."
