Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both neighbors emphasize the importance of taking care of each other as neighbors.\n2. Neighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B.\n3. Neighbors A offers to help Neighbors B with getting into a workout routine.\n4. Neighbors A believes in setting goals, developing a positive attitude, and taking action for personal development and career advancement.\n5. Neighbors B offers to be more supportive and check in on Neighbors A more often.\n6. Neighbor A and Neighbor B went to a concert together in the past and had a great time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided consists of general statements summarizing the history between Neighbors A and B. However, very little of it is directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT concerning the demarcation of property boundaries. Some sentences in MEMORY, such as the emphasis on taking care of each other and offering support (Statements 1 and 5), suggest a positive and cooperative relationship between the neighbors, which might be helpful in interpreting the boundary discussion context. However, most of the MEMORY, such as sharing books, workout routines, personal development, or attending concerts together (Statements 2, 3, 4, and 6), do not provide significant contextual information that directly informs the boundary marking discussion. Also, while the sentences are naturally phrased, the lack of relevance to the specific property discussion reduces the overall helpfulness of the MEMORY. Therefore, the memory rated a score of 2 for limited, indirect relevance to the context."
