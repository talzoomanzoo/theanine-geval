Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss! Co-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes. Co-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's competence and effort in their work.\n2. Co-worker A strives to do their best in their work.\n3. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.\n4. Co-worker A is known for being competent and is trusted with important projects.\n5. Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues.\n6. Co-worker A is seen as competent and reliable by Co-worker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "We appreciate your dedication to keeping things on track. Your attention to detail definitely helps everything run smoothly around here.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that can be helpful in understanding the dynamic between Co-workers A and B. Sentences 1, 3, and 6, in particular, offer insights into how Co-worker B perceives Co-worker A, which might be useful for generating a nuanced response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY lacks specific information directly related to the current dialogue, like the context for Co-worker A's insistence on their role as boss. Additionally, while the sentences provide a general sense of appreciation and competence, they do not clearly demonstrate the development or causality of past interactions, which could have better supported the current dialogue context. Therefore, the MEMORY moderately meets the criteria for being helpful, meriting a score of 3."
