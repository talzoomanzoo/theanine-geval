    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today? Classmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own. Classmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others. Classmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone. Classmates A: You're not a burden, don't worry. And I'm always here to help you out. Classmates B: I appreciate that, but I don't want to always rely on others. I want to be more independent. Classmates A: I get it. Maybe there are some small things you can do on your own to start feeling more independent? Classmates B: Like what? Classmates A: Well, maybe you can start by making a list of things you'd like to do on your own and we can work on achieving those goals together. Classmates B: That sounds like a good idea. Thanks for understanding, Classmates A. Classmates A: Of course, I'm always here to support you. Hey, speaking of goals, remember when we talked about your guitar playing a few months ago? How's that going? Classmates B: It's going really well, thanks for asking! I've been practicing every day and I feel like I'm getting better. Classmates A: That's awesome! Have you thought about joining a band or playing gigs around town? Classmates B: Not really, I'm still a bit nervous about performing in front of people. Classmates A: I get it, performing can be scary. But maybe in a few months, we can work on setting a goal for you to do a small performance somewhere. Classmates B: That sounds like a challenge, but also kind of exciting. I'm in! Classmates A: Great, I'm looking forward to seeing you rock out on stage. Hey, remember when we talked about your new car a few hours ago? How's that going? Classmates B: I'm loving it! It's so much fun to drive. Thanks for asking, Classmates A.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B finds it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after a conversation they had about following dreams.\n2. Classmates A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as evidenced by their conversation about their respective experiences.\n3. Classmates A finds pursuing music rewarding and is passionate about it.\n4. Classmates A and B enjoy jamming together and plan to collaborate on music in the future.\n5. Classmates A plans to showcase their new car by driving it around town and to gigs.\n6. Classmates A enjoys reminiscing about childhood memories, particularly about playing on swings and making music with friends.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "To evaluate the helpfulness of the MEMORY based on the provided DIALOGUE CONTEXT, let's analyze each sentence in the MEMORY to see how they relate to the context and whether they provide helpful information for generating the next response:\n\n1. The MEMORY mentions that Classmates B finds it awesome Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music. However, this sentence is slightly misleading since it doesn't capture Classmates B's nervousness about performing, which is more relevant in the context. Nevertheless, it does relate to the musical theme present in the context where Classmates A encourages Classmates B to perform.\n\n2. Sentence 2 highlights a general observation about the supportive relationship which is evident from the context. This sentiment aligns with the supportive conversation seen in the context as they discuss setting goals for musical performances.\n\n3. Sentence 3 regarding Classmates A's passion for music supports overall context themes; the focus in the conversation is mainly on Classmates B’s progress and goals, but this still provides a backdrop.\n\n4. Sentence 4 talks about Classmates A and B enjoying jamming together and planning future collaborations. This element is speculative and not explicitly supported by the context, but it generates a continuation idea.\n\n5. Sentence 5 discusses Classmates A showcasing their car, somewhat related but it is Classmates B who currently is enjoying a new car per the context. The memory sentence could be seen as confusing in terms of roles and distinctions between the new car narrative.\n\n6. Sentence 6 about Classmates A reminiscing about childhood and music with friends is irrelevant and has no direct ties to the conversation between A and B shown in the context.\n\nThe overall representation of the MEMORY in the context is not very precise especially when containing hypothetical or speculative interactions that were not part of the initial dialogue; however, sentences surrounding the aspect of supportiveness partially aid in understanding relationship dynamics better.\n\nHelpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains elements and themes which slightly align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, especially revolving around the supportive relationship and aspects of music. However, some information is not directly evident or is speculative, which makes the MEMORY less beneficial for directly generating subsequent dialogue relevant to the given context. Sentences about the childhood addendum, and mix-up on who’s passionate about what distract. The structure is somewhat connected but could misleadingly suggest false narratives therefore the helpfulness is average."
