Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind? Classmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you. Classmates B: Oh, really? Classmates A: Yes, really. I know we've been friends for a while now, but I feel like there may be something more between us. Classmates B: Hmm, I never thought about it that way. But I can’t deny that we have a great connection. Classmates A: Exactly! I just feel like we could be more than just friends. If it's something you're open to, of course. Classmates B: I get what you’re saying,. And to be honest, I’ve had similar thoughts lately. I’m definitely open to exploring this. Classmates A: I’m so relieved to hear that. I was worried that I might be crossing a line by expressing my feelings.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B are close and have a level of trust between them.\n2. Classmates B feels relieved to have someone to confide in about the secret.\n3. Classmate A recalls a moment where they admired Classmate B's courage and strength in sharing a secret, showing their supportive and compassionate nature.\n4. Classmates A discovered a secret that Classmates B has been keeping.\n5. Classmates A and B have had a previous positive interaction in a coffee shop where Classmates A rubbed Classmates B's neck, providing relaxation.\n6. Classmates A offered help and support to Classmates B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not entirely cohesive or directly linked. Several pieces of MEMORY describe a supportive and trusting relationship between Classmates A and B, which is relevant for understanding their conversation about exploring a deeper connection. For instance, MEMORY points like (1) and (3) highlight their closeness and Classmate A's admiration for Classmate B, complementing the current dialogue's theme of evolving their relationship. However, certain details, such as the secret-sharing mentioned in (2) and (4) and the coffee shop interaction in (5), although potentially relevant for illustrating trust and prior closeness, are not explicitly tied to the current context of discussing romantic feelings. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it included clearer connections to Classmates A's confession of feelings or Classmates B's openness to exploring further. Overall, the MEMORY has a few relevant aspects for understanding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks strong connectivity and development throughout."
