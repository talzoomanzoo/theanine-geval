Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together. Neighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left? Neighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him. Neighbors B: That's not true, Neighbor A. You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are. Neighbors A: I just feel so lost right now. I don't know how to move on from this. Neighbors B: It's going to take time, but you will get through this. Do you want to talk about how you're feeling or do something to take your mind off of things? Neighbors A: Maybe both? I just feel so overwhelmed and I don't know what to do.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n2. Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.\n3. Neighbor A finds solace in nature and believes that it helps in coping with their emotions.\n4. Neighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there.\n5. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have a close friendship and have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n6. Neighbor A and Neighbor B are neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: While the MEMORY contains information about the relationship between Neighbor A and Neighbor B, the details do not directly pertain to the ongoing conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Neighbor A's recent breakup. The MEMORY provides some context such as their friendship and past interactions, but this is not directly helpful or relevant to the specific issue Neighbor A is dealing with in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Moreover, the MEMORY mentions unrelated events such as the loss of a grandmother and moving to a new neighborhood, which do not effectively contribute to the dialogue and do not aid in generating an appropriate response for the situation at hand. Therefore, although there is some context, it lacks specificity and direct relevancy to the current emotional discussion, making the MEMORY only slightly helpful."
