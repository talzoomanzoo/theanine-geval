Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel really fulfilled as a leader and guide. Helping others gives me a sense of purpose. Co-workers B: I can see that. You always seem to know just what to do to make people feel better. Co-workers A: Yeah, I've had a lot of practice over the years. It's just something that comes naturally to me. Co-workers B: Do you remember that time when you were led to a safe place by the commander? You must have felt pretty grateful for his guidance then. Co-workers A: Absolutely. It was a really tough time and I was so relieved to have someone show me the way. I try to pay it forward by being that kind of leader for others. Co-workers B: That's a great attitude to have. Speaking of leadership, do you think you would ever want to take on a higher position in the company? Co-workers A: I'm always open to new opportunities, but I don't want to do it just for the sake of having more power. If I could make a bigger difference in that role, then I would consider it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A had a positive experience with a commander who helped them feel safe.\n2. Co-worker B values finding fulfillment in work, pursuing hobbies, making a difference in the world, and building relationships with others.\n3. Co-worker A believes that everyone has the ability to create opportunities and make their own luck through hard work and seizing opportunities.\n4. Co-worker B emphasizes the importance of acknowledging privileges and using them to make the world a better place.\n5. Co-worker A values making money and is interested in opportunities to do so.\n6. Co-worker A is self-aware about being stubborn and needing to learn to compromise.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a very thoughtful approach. It's clear that you prioritize making a positive impact in any role you take on. It's important to find that balance between personal fulfillment and the opportunity to create change.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information that is clearly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Memory Point 1 directly relates to a discussion in the dialogue where Co-worker A talks about being guided to a safe place by the commander, helping to give context to Co-worker A's leadership fulfillment. This connection shows relevance and development of conversation themes. Memory Points 2 and 4, although related to values and attitudes that might indirectly influence discussions on leadership and opportunities, do not directly relate to the specific dialogue in this context. Memory Points 3, 5, and 6 are not directly applicable to the current dialogue as they talk about beliefs and values in a more general sense. While not all sentences are immediately beneficial for generating the next response, the relevant details are clearly present and naturally structured when they are related. Overall, MEMORY provides some helpful information, but the connection and relevancy is not consistently clear throughout all points."
