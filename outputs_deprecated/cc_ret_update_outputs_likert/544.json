Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, check out this spot I found to camp out for the night. It's perfect! Classmates B: Wow, this view is amazing! Classmates A: I know, right? And it's completely level and free of any debris. We won't have to worry about rolling off our sleeping pads or anything like that. Classmates B: It definitely looks like a great spot to spend the night. How did you manage to find it? Classmates A: Just a stroke of luck, I guess. I was exploring the area and stumbled upon it. It's always good to be a little adventurous and explore new places, you never know what you might find. Classmates B: That's true. You always seem to find the best spots. Like that time we went camping near the lake and had the whole place to ourselves. Classmates A: Oh yeah, that was a great spot too. It's always fun to explore and go on new adventures. Classmates B: Definitely. And it's also important to be prepared and bring all the necessary camping gear, like extra food and water, first-aid items, and warm clothes.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B finds Classmates A's involvement in the community admirable and important.\n2. Classmate A expresses a desire to find alternative ways to have fun and make a positive impact in the community.\n3. Classmates A is proactive and curious, taking the initiative to research topics of interest.\n4. Classmates B remembers Classmates A's previous involvement in community improvement projects and acknowledges their passion for making a difference.\n5. Classmate A and Classmate B are classmates who attended a party together.\n6. Classmate B emphasizes the importance of being cautious with allergies, carrying necessary medication, and taking precautions to prevent severe reactions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, being prepared is key, especially when it comes to safety. I remember you always stressing the importance of being cautious with allergies and taking necessary precautions. It's great that we can enjoy the outdoors while also being mindful of potential risks.",
    "prediction": "**Helpfulness Score: 2**\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some relevant information about the personalities and past interactions of Classmates A and B, which can be useful for helping a model generate a response in certain contexts. Specifically, the MEMORY notes Classmate A's proactive nature and involvement in community projects, which could be relevant to their exploratory nature mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, these connections are not clearly outlined, and most of the MEMORY points do not directly align with or enhance the context of the camping discussion. Furthermore, the MEMORY lacks a naturally structured narrative that would help the model easily identify important contextual cues related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, while some aspects are tangentially related, they are not explicitly useful for the specific context provided."
