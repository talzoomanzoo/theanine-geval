Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager!

Co-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products. Co-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader? Co-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago. Co-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader.\n2. Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\n3.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, reflecting Co-worker A's professional growth and aspirations for leadership. Sentences 2 and 3 specifically tie to the context where Co-worker A's past fantasies of leadership are discussed, making them directly useful. Sentences 1 and 5 provide background on Co-worker Aâ€™s aspiration and sense of responsibility, which are aligned with the dialogue's focus on leadership. Sentence 4 alludes to Co-worker A's progression in their career, reinforcing the excitement of the promotion mentioned in the dialogue. Sentence 6 provides context on Co-worker B's supportive nature. Overall, the MEMORY is helpful, but improving the natural connection and phrasing of some sentences would make it even more beneficial for a language model to generate a response."
