    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today? Co-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there? Co-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done. Co-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded. Co-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out. Co-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends? Co-workers A: Ugh, don't remind me. That was such a disaster.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides.\n2. Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits.\n3. Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides.\n4. Co-worker A went through a painful breakup and finds it hard to trust people.\n5. Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions.\n6. Co-worker A is trying to improve their punctuality and cut back on drinking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's important to plan ahead and avoid situations like that in the future. How are you working on being more responsible with your late nights out and transportation?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful context that can aid in generating a response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, the note about Co-worker B being aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights and transportation, as well as Co-worker A trying to be more responsible, ties to the mention of being stranded after a night out. However, while some sentences provide relevant context, others are not directly related to the current conversation about going to the post office or sending packages. The MEMORY could be structured better to highlight the connection between previous discussions and the current topic more clearly, ensuring a smoother relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, additional context about their struggles with late nights and transportation could offer more direct ties to the conversation, but the MEMORY captures the general themes of responsibility and punctuality, which remain somewhat helpful."
