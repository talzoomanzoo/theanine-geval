    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water? Neighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for. Neighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit. Neighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water. Neighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it. Neighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again. Neighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n2. Neighbors A mentioned mowing the lawn with an old push mower, indicating they are responsible for the yard work.\n3. Both Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\n4. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n5. Neighbors A and B plan to work on mowing the lawn together next time to make it easier and possibly discover more things in common.\n6. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I do remember that! You were determined to get the yard looking good. Maybe next time we tackle the lawn together, it will be a bit easier with both of us working on it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically mentioning past interactions related to mowing the lawn, which is reflected in the last line of the context. For instance, the second memory sentence directly references the topic of the lawn, indicating responsibility for yard work, and the fourth sentence suggests familiarity between the neighbors, which aligns with their casual conversation in the context. However, some statements like the first and third, while indicating a relationship dynamic, are not directly helpful for continuing the dialogue specifically about the cold water incident or the joking nature of their interaction. Overall, while there is relevant information regarding their shared activity of mowing, the connections between past interactions are not strongly detailed or causally networked to significantly aid in generating a next response focused on the present tense of the dialogue context."
