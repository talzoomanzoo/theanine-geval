Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A saw George at the store and exchanged waves.\n2. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's organization skills and wishes to improve their own organization.\n3. Neighbors A and B both took a cooking class together last year.\n4. Neighbors A is very organized in their room and house and never wastes time searching for things.\n5. Neighbor A is feeling frustrated and is considering going to a bar to find someone for a casual encounter.\n6. Neighbors A and B believe in doing nice things for others to bring the community together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's wonderful to hear! I bet you have some incredible stories to share from your trip. I wish I could be as organized as you are with all your travel plans.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some background about Neighbors A and B, such as their previous interactions and shared activities. However, most of the information is not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which talks about Neighbors A's trip to South America. The memories about Neighbors A's organization, seeing George at the store, or considering a casual encounter do not have a clear connection or relevance to the context of discussing the trip. The memory about taking a cooking class together is a bit more relevant as it shows a shared experience between the neighbors, but it still doesn't aid in responding to the statement about the trip. Overall, the memory lacks sufficient context regarding travel or experiences that could be useful for generating a next response related to a trip story. Hence, the rating is on the lower side."
