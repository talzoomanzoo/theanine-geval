Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, have you ever tried to imagine what it would be like to think like someone else?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor became a mentor to help others going through similar situations.\n2. Mentee agrees to try the advice and express gratitude towards Mentor.\n3. Mentee has been thinking about helping others who may be in abusive cults.\n4. Mentee wants to make a positive impact in people's lives and is grateful for Mentor's support.\n5. Mentee agrees to teach in a way that allows people to make their own decisions about their beliefs.\n6. Mentor encourages Mentee to approach teaching religion with an open mind and heart.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, empathy is key to understanding others' perspectives. It's great that you're considering different viewpoints in your teaching approach.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some sentences that offer helpful information relevant to generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, memory points 3, 4, and 5 could be relevant as they reveal Mentee's thoughts about helping others, making a positive impact, and allowing others to make their own decisions regarding beliefs. This aligns with the current inquiry about imagining thinking like someone else. However, not all sentences directly apply to the context at hand, such as memory point 1, which lacks clear relevance to Mentee's current interest in thinking like someone else. Overall, the MEMORY provides moderate helpfulness in understanding past interactions between Mentor and Mentee, but it could be better structured or more aligned with the current dialogue for a higher score."
