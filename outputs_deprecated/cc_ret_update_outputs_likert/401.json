    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned? Classmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed. Classmates A: Embarrassed? Why? Classmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during the difficult situation.\n2. Classmates A is stranded in space, running out of oxygen and feeling lightheaded.\n3. Classmates B praised Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n4. Classmates A helped Classmates B out of friendship and believes in supporting each other.\n5. Classmates A and B have been on field trips to other planets or moons before, like Mars.\n6. Classmate B praises Classmate A's attention to detail and work ethic as truly impressive.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Oh no, I hope it wasn't anything too serious. Remember, we've been through some tough situations together, like when you were stranded in space. You handled that with such bravery and quick thinking.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY contains sentences that are largely irrelevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context involves Classmates A and B discussing Classmate B's embarrassment, whereas the MEMORY includes events related to space experiences, support during difficult situations, field trips to other planets, and praises for work ethic. These details do not provide helpful background or contextual cues to address the present conversation about embarrassment. Furthermore, the sentences do not show clear development or causality that relates to the current situation. Thus, MEMORY is not helpful in generating a relevant next response for the given context."
