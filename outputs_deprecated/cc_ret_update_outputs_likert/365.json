    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message. Co-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident. Co-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows. Co-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument.\n2. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs.\n3. Co-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\n4. Co-worker A has experience dealing with challenging clients and emphasizes the importance of communication and setting expectations.\n5. Co-worker A believes their evidence is more compelling than the opposing side's evidence.\n6. Co-worker A agrees to be more conscious of how they come across to others in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate that, thank you. It's crucial to me that I am able to effectively communicate and make a strong case based on evidence and personal experiences.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around Co-worker A's skills in public speaking and presenting arguments, with specific mention of presenting evidence in court. These elements are effectively reflected in the MEMORY, particularly in sentences 1, 3, and 5, which discuss Co-worker A collecting evidence, the nature of the evidence, and its perceived strength compared to the opposition. Sentence 2 complements the context by highlighting Co-worker A's courage, resonating with the theme of public speaking and persuasion. Sentence 4, while not directly related to the court argument, supports the context by emphasizing Co-worker A's communication skills. Sentence 6, although somewhat tangential, still relates to interpersonal communication, an aspect of public speaking. The MEMORY is generally well-structured, providing continuity and demonstrating a clear connection to the context, with only minor deviations."
