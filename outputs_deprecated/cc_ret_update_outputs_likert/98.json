Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you. Classmates B: Oh really? What are they? Classmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners. Classmates B: Wow, that sounds amazing! What kind of project are you thinking about? Classmates A: I was thinking about starting a marketing agency specialized in social media. Classmates B: That's a great idea! I'd love to work with you on that. We could really make a difference in the industry. Classmates A: Yes, exactly! And I think our skills complement each other's so well. Classmates B: I totally agree. You're so creative and outgoing, while I'm more analytical and detail-oriented. Classmates A: It's like we were meant to work together, right? Classmates B: Absolutely! I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. Classmates A: Me too. And honestly, it's a bit of a relief to finally have a solid plan for the future.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n2. Classmate A and Classmate B enjoy singing karaoke together and look forward to future outings.\n3. Classmate B admires Classmate A's outgoing nature and wants to be more like them.\n4. Classmates A is looking forward to meeting up with Classmates B again after getting better sleep.\n5. Classmates A and B are open to meeting for coffee again in the future.\n6. Classmates A is social and enjoys meeting new people.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does not provide much helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding the specific plans to work on a marketing agency together. While there are some elements (like the mention of Classmates B admiring Classmates A's outgoing nature) that could vaguely relate to their complementary skills, the MEMORY mostly consists of unrelated information, such as their enjoyment of karaoke or plans to meet for coffee. The sentences do not clearly outline the development or causality relevant to the specific business venture discussion, thus providing limited assistance in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
