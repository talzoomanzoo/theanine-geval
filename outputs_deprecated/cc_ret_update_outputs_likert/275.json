Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel really fulfilled as a leader and guide. Helping others gives me a sense of purpose. Co-workers B: I can see that. You always seem to know just what to do to make people feel better.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B values finding fulfillment in work, pursuing hobbies, making a difference in the world, and building relationships with others.\n2. Co-worker A had a positive experience with a commander who helped them feel safe.\n3. Co-worker B emphasizes the importance of acknowledging privileges and using them to make the world a better place.\n4. Co-worker A believes that everyone has the ability to create opportunities and make their own luck through hard work and seizing opportunities.\n5. Co-worker A values making money and is interested in opportunities to do so.\n6. Co-worker A is self-aware about being stubborn and needing to learn to compromise.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks, I appreciate that. It's important to me to create a safe and supportive environment for everyone around me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about Co-worker A and their sense of fulfillment and leadership. For instance, sentence 2 aligns with the idea of a positive leadership experience, which may relate to Co-worker A's current sense of fulfillment as a leader and guide. Sentence 4 also ties into Co-worker A's ethos of creating opportunities and making one's own luck, which complements their role as a guide. However, many of the sentences in MEMORY, such as 1, 3, 5, and 6, do not directly contribute to generating a proper response in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. They either focus more on Co-worker B or are tangential to the specific topic of fulfillment through leadership. Additionally, while the sentences are well-phrased, they do not all contribute to the development of the dialogue. Therefore, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but lacks coherence and direct relevancy to the dialogue context, resulting in a score of 3."
