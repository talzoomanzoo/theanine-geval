    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly. Neighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit? Neighbors A: It was Chicago. I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations. Neighbors B: I bet it was a nice change of scenery from our neighborhood. Neighbors A: Definitely. But you know, it's interesting how much our neighborhood has grown on me over the years. I remember when I first moved here, I was so unsure about it. Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember. But you stayed because you wanted to be here. Neighbors A: That's right. And since then, I've made so many great memories here. It's become my home.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A enjoys living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbors A is excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends.\n3. Neighbors B has been living in the neighborhood for some time and is supportive of Neighbors A.\n4. Neighbors A just moved to a new neighborhood and is getting to know the area.\n5. Neighbors A and B live in the same place and find comfort in it.\n6. Neighbors A appreciates having friendly faces around and hopes to make new friends soon.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers a mixture of information that is somewhat helpful regarding the dialogue context. Sentences like 1, 3, and 5 give insight into Neighbors A and B's relationship and shared environment, supporting the dialogue's mention of Neighbors A's growing attachment and friendships in the neighborhood. These sentences demonstrate a level of development and connection relevant to the context. However, sentences like 2, 4, and 6 introduce potential confusion, as they imply Neighbors A is newly exploring or having just moved, which doesn't align entirely with the dialogue where Neighbors A mentions having made many memories over the years. Thus, not all sentences are clearly beneficial or well-structured to indicate the past interactions that would aid in generating a response. The overall coherence and causality between statements in the MEMORY also seem limited, affecting the ease with which a language model could navigate it."
