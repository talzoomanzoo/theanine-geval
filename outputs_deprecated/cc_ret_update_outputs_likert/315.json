Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits.\n2. Co-worker A has been successful in not being late to work for weeks.\n3. Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions.\n4. Co-worker A is trying to improve their punctuality and cut back on drinking.\n5. Co-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides.\n6. Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! It sounds like you're being proactive and getting things done early. Keep it up!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits, which indicates a certain context of co-worker interactions and efforts for improvement. However, it doesn't really address the specific topic of visiting the post office raised in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the MEMORY offers some insight into Co-worker A's personal struggles and behaviors, it lacks a direct connection to the current dialogue, which is about completing a specific task (going to the post office). Thus, it provides limited helpfulness for generating a response that would continue the conversation about Co-worker A's trip to the post office. The MEMORY's sentences have a structure that indicates Co-worker A's development and efforts to change behaviors, but it lacks direct relevance to the current topic of conversation."
