Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today. Wife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that. Husband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you. Wife: You always go above and beyond, dear. Husband: It's the little things that count, right? Wife: Definitely. Speaking of little things, do you remember when you told me about catching the bus just in time a few months ago? Husband: Oh yes, I remember. I was so relieved I didn't have to wait in the cold for the next one. Wife: It's amazing how small moments like that can make such a big difference in our day, isn't it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful.\n2. The wife is glad to see the husband finding a sense of purpose and being happy.\n3. The husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that make him happy outside of work and family life.\n4. The wife mentions that the husband had to run to catch the bus a couple of years ago.\n5. The husband enjoys being outside and loves the weather after being stuck indoors at work.\n6. The husband believes it's important to cherish meaningful connections in life, like the one he has with his friend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some potentially relevant sentences, but overall it does not effectively connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT in a clear and helpful way. Sentence 1 is relevant and somewhat connected to the context as it aligns with the discussion about \"little things.\" However, it is generic and doesn't provide specific past interactions. Sentence 4 loosely relates to the bus incident mentioned in the context but incorrectly references it as a \"few months ago\" when the memory says \"a couple of years ago,\" which creates a discrepancy. The remainder of the sentences (2, 3, 5, 6) provide additional details about the husband and wife, but they are not directly useful for generating the next response based on the immediate dialogue context. They lack clear development or causality relevant to the specific topic of cozy domestic moments and small meaningful experiences discussed in the context. The memory, therefore, provides limited assistance in generating a more contextually relevant and informed response."
