Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing! Neighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go? Neighbors A: I visited Brazil and Peru. The culture and food were incredible.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and B both took a cooking class together last year.\n2. Neighbors A and B believe in doing nice things for others to bring the community together.\n3. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's organization skills and wishes to improve their own organization.\n4. Both Neighbors A and B believe in the importance of learning and self-improvement.\n5. Neighbors A saw George at the store and exchanged waves.\n6. Neighbor A is feeling frustrated and is considering going to a bar to find someone for a casual encounter.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like an incredible experience! I've always wanted to travel to South America. Did you try any new dishes while you were there?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains sentences that do not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context is about Neighbors A's recent trip to South America, specifically mentioning Brazil and Peru, and their experiences with the culture and food there. However, the MEMORY includes unrelated details such as a cooking class, the neighbors' beliefs in community, admiration for organization skills, a random encounter with George, and personal frustrations of Neighbor A. None of these elements provide helpful information or contextual relevance for generating a coherent and appropriate response to the current dialogue about the South American trip. The sentences do not demonstrate any clear causality, connection, or development concerning the dialogue context, making them unhelpful for the task at hand."
