    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now! Neighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen? Neighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A made a big career change recently and is much happier now.\n2. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's decision and admires the courage it took.\n3. Neighbors A took the leap to make a change and is glad they did.\n4. Neighbors A and B had a conversation a couple of years ago about needing a change.\n5. Neighbors B has been supportive of Neighbors A's job search, offering to connect them with people in different industries.\n6. Neighbors A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY mainly focuses on Neighbors A's career change and the supportive relationship between A and B. However, in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, the main focus is on Neighbors A becoming a millionaire due to an inheritance, which is not addressed at all in the MEMORY. While the supportive relationship might offer some minor contextual background, the MEMORY does not provide helpful information that can directly aid in generating a response to the current conversation about the newfound wealth and how Neighbors A plans to manage it. Also, the sentences in MEMORY do not have a causal or relevant connection to the conversation about the sudden financial transition, making it less helpful in understanding this particular dialogue scenario."
