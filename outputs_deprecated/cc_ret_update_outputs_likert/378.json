    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to share something with you. I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend. Classmates B: That's really kind of you. What did you do to help? Classmates A: She was moving and needed some extra hands to pack up her things and load them onto a truck. So I spent most of the day helping her out. Classmates B: Wow, that's really generous of you. I'm sure your neighbor really appreciated it. Classmates A: I hope so. I just felt like it was the right thing to do. I know if I were in that situation, I would appreciate any help I could get.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support.\n2. Classmates A appreciates the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n3. Classmates B handled a previous mix-up with the class schedule well, showing responsibility and reliability.\n4. Classmates A and B started as acquaintances and have developed a strong friendship.\n5. Classmates B was initially worried about Classmates A going out with friends but they value each other's opinions.\n6. Classmates A and B value their friendship and feel comfortable talking to each other about anything.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You have a big heart, that's for sure. It's great to see you being so caring and selfless. Your neighbor is lucky to have you around.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information about the relationship between Classmates A and B, emphasizing their friendship and appreciation for each other's support, which might be helpful in understanding the dynamics between the two speakers in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, most of the sentences are more relevant to past interactions not directly related to the current context of Classmate A helping their neighbor. Therefore, while the memory offers some context about the general rapport and mutual support between the two classmates, it lacks specific information relevant to the particular scenario discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, thereby providing moderate helpfulness."
