    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become? Neighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out? Neighbors A: Yes, I go to the gym every day and lift weights. It's been really helping me build muscle.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B appreciates Neighbors A's handy skills.\n2. Neighbor A noticed some wood near their backyard and asked Neighbor B if they had seen it too.\n3. Neighbors A and B are observing wood that appears to be freshly cut from a tree.\n4. Neighbors A values double-checking before leaving the house.\n5. Neighbors A is good at fixing things, particularly electronics.\n6. Neighbors A apologized to Neighbors B for their behavior and admitted to being wrong.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provided does not offer relevant information for generating a next response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context involves a conversation about Neighbors A's strength and gym habits. However, the MEMORY contains unrelated information about handy skills, wood observation, double-checking habits, fixing skills, and an apology, none of which connect to the subject of working out or building muscle. The sentences are not structured in a way that shows relevance or causality pertinent to the context, making it difficult for a language model to draw any useful connections for continuing the conversation."
