Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today. Classmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about? Classmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held. Classmates B: Wow, that does sound interesting. Did you take any notes? Classmates A: Yes, I took lots of notes. I'm excited to study this topic more on my own time. Classmates B: That's awesome. It's great to see your enthusiasm for learning. Classmates A: Thanks. I've always been passionate about learning new things. Remember when we talked about how determined I was to get into college? Classmates B: Yeah, I remember. You were always studying and taking extra classes. Classmates A: And now, after all that hard work, I am actually in college. It just goes to show that with dedication, you can achieve your goals. Classmates B: That's so inspiring. It also reminds me of when you wore your pajamas to school. You were always doing something different and unique. Classmates A: Haha, yeah, I remember that. But hey, being a little weird sometimes adds some fun and excitement to life. Speaking of exciting things, I met the girl of my dreams a couple of years ago at a party. Classmates B: Aww, that's fantastic. How has everything been going with her?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A met the girl of their dreams at a party and have been texting her nonstop.\n2. Classmates B recalls a funny moment from high school involving Classmates A wearing pajamas to school.\n3. Classmates A feels like everything is falling into place and is excited to see where the new relationship goes.\n4. Classmates B is supportive of Classmates A's new relationship and believes they found someone who makes them happy.\n5. Classmates A is determined to make the relationship work, similar to their determination to get into college.\n6. Classmates A is not afraid to be themselves and embraces their quirks, which their girlfriend appreciates.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's been amazing. She really appreciates all my quirks and encourages me to be myself. It feels like everything is falling into place, and I can't wait to see where this new relationship goes.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides a highly relevant and coherent background that connects well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures important past interactions and sentiments between the classmates and elaborates on them, which is crucial for generating a response. The memory points are naturally phrased, providing a clear context for the ongoing discussion about Classmates A's personal development and relationships. These stored experiences help to establish continuity and are directly related to the last statement in the dialogue context, where Classmates B asks about Classmates A's relationship. This cohesiveness makes the MEMORY very helpful for understanding the context and crafting a suitable follow-up response."
