Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today. Wife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that. Husband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you. Wife: You always go above and beyond, dear. Husband: It's the little things that count, right?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful.\n2. The husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that make him happy outside of work and family life.\n3. The wife is glad to see the husband finding a sense of purpose and being happy.\n4. Husband values the supportive community of believers at church and appreciates having his wife by his side.\n5. The wife is supportive of her husband's hobbies and interests, such as playing the guitar.\n6. The husband enjoys being outside and loves the weather after being stuck indoors at work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, it's those small gestures that make all the difference. Your attention to detail and thoughtfulness really make our home feel special.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information that could be helpful for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The first sentence aligns well with the context, highlighting the mutual feeling of the husband and wife that small gestures are significant, which connects to the conversation about the husband making the apartment cozy. However, the remaining sentences veer away from the specific situation discussed in the dialogue (decorating with lights and candles) and focus more on general aspects of their relationship and the husband's personal interests and values.\n\nWhile these sentences do convey the supportive nature of their relationship and could indirectly support the context of the conversation by shedding light on the husband's character and their mutual support, they do not build directly on the scenario in the given context. The memory lacks clear direct connections or developments related to the act of decorating and how it affects their current interaction. However, the sentences are naturally phrased and easy to understand, which helps in identifying less relevant parts. Thus, I rate it a 3 for some relevance but not a full, direct linkage."
