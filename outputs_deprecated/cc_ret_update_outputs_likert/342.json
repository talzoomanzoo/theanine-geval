Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B finished a project and sent it to the manager for review.\n2. Co-worker B appreciates the pen and thanks Co-worker A for the gesture.\n3. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a thoughtful gesture.\n4. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a symbol of trust in their professional relationship.\n5. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen that they still use.\n6. Co-worker B offered to help by getting crutches for Co-worker A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains bits of information that describe past interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B. However, most of these sentences focus on the exchange of a pen, which is not directly related to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT concerning a written report submitted to the boss. While it hints at a positive and supportive relationship through gestures and offers of help, this information poorly relates to the specific topic of the written report's potential use for the boss. The memory offers limited helpfulness in generating a relevant next response to Co-Worker A's statement. Additionally, the structure of the memory doesn't clearly demonstrate the development of interactions that would be beneficial in creating a response in the context of Co-worker Aâ€™s concerns about the written report."
