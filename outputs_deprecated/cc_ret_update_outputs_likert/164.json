Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Thank you for finding my glasses for me, Mentor. I always seem to misplace them. Mentor: Not a problem, Mentee. I'm glad I could help.  Mentee: This actually reminds me of when I was struggling with substance abuse. I would often lose things or forget where I put things because of my drinking. It's amazing how much clearer my mind is now that I'm sober. Mentor: That's a great observation, Mentee. Sobriety can definitely improve your cognitive abilities and overall wellbeing. It's amazing how much substance abuse can hold us back in life.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentee has a history of substance abuse but has been sober for a year.\n2. Mentee values living in the moment and staying focused on their sobriety and goals.\n3. Mentor is proud of Mentee for making positive changes and taking control of their life.\n4. The Mentee is dedicated to their sobriety and believes incorporating yoga into their routine will benefit their mental and physical health.\n5. Mentor acknowledges Mentee's achievements and provides ongoing support and guidance.\n6. The Mentor advises the Mentee to be gentle with themselves when they slip back into old patterns.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides highly relevant and helpful information for generating a proper next response in the context of the conversation. The details about the Mentee's history of substance abuse and their commitment to sobriety are directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where the Mentee mentions their past struggles and current sobriety. The MEMORY also highlights the Mentor's supportive role, which aligns with the supportive and positive interaction in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the sentences are phrased in a clear and naturally connected manner, allowing the language model to easily identify and utilize the context for generating appropriate responses. The MEMORY captures the development of the relationship between Mentor and Mentee through past interactions effectively."
