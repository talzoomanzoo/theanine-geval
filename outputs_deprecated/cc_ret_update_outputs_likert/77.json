Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret? Neighbors B: Of course, what's up? Neighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door. Neighbors B: Oh, why are you hiding from her? Neighbors A: She wants me to go to a family dinner tonight, but I'm too tired and just want to relax at home. Neighbors B: Maybe you should talk to her about it and let her know how you feel. Neighbors A: I know, but I don't want to disappoint her.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation.\n2. Neighbor B offers support and suggests planning a dinner to celebrate Neighbor A's new adventures in learning.\n3. Neighbors B is open to trying new recipes and is excited to receive the chickpea curry recipe from Neighbors A.\n4. Neighbors B is excited and supportive of Neighbors A's new ability.\n5. Neighbors A enjoys trying new things, like new recipes.\n6. Neighbors A and B are discussing the idea of having telekinetic abilities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides minimal helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around Neighbors A hiding from their mom to avoid attending a family dinner. However, the MEMORY sections mainly focus on unrelated topics, such as cooking, new recipes, telekinetic abilities, and a dinner to celebrate new adventures in learning. These elements provide little connection or relevance to the current dialogue, which is centered around a familial obligation and Neighbors A's desire to relax. None of these sentences contribute directly to the conversation about hiding from the mom or the dilemma with the family dinner. The MEMORY is not structured in a way that highlights the development of interactions related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
