Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today? Co-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there? Co-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done. Co-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded. Co-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out. Co-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends? Co-workers A: Ugh, don't remind me. That was such a disaster. Co-workers B: It was definitely not one of your finest moments. But it's good to see that you're being responsible now and taking care of things like sending packages. Co-workers A: Thanks. I'm trying to be more responsible and reliable these days. Co-workers B: That's great to hear. It reminds me of the time when you were a great leader in your country. You were strong, determined, and made a positive impact.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides.\n2. Co-worker A is trying to improve their punctuality and cut back on drinking.\n3. Co-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides.\n4. Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits.\n5. Both co-workers show a supportive and caring attitude towards each other.\n6. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to give people a chance.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you for the kind words. I really appreciate your support and encouragement. It means a lot coming from you. I'll keep working on being more responsible and reliable.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a moderate amount of helpful information for generating a proper next response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory contains information about Co-worker A trying to be more responsible, which aligns with the dialogue context where Co-worker B comments on Co-worker A being more responsible with packages and recalls a past incident related to responsibility. However, some details in MEMORY, such as concerns about punctuality, drinking habits, and Co-worker B's supportive attitude, are not directly linked to the current conversation about the post office and past leadership, although they do provide some background context on the relationship dynamics. The MEMORY outlines some supportive actions between the co-workers, which could be beneficial for understanding their relationship in future conversations. However, it lacks direct causality and development related to the current dialogue context. Overall, it partially provides context but does not completely connect with the present conversation in a directly helpful way."
