    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm really excited about finding a buyer for my product. I think it has a lot of potential. Neighbors B: That's great to hear, what kind of product is it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and Neighbors B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as they enjoy having coffee and chatting together.\n2. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's efforts to change and become a better version of themselves.\n3. Neighbors B expresses a desire for Neighbors A to succeed and emphasizes the importance of treating others with respect and putting in effort at work.\n4. Neighbors B appreciated Neighbors A's support during this difficult situation.\n5. Neighbors A is trying to improve their behavior at work and be a better colleague.\n6. Neighbors A reassured Neighbors B that they had nothing to do with the dog's disappearance.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some background about Neighbors A and B's relationship, which could be useful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specific elements such as their supportive relationship and Neighbors B's encouragement for Neighbors A to succeed (e.g., memories 1, 2, and 3) can inform the tone and manner of a response. However, while these sentences are structured coherently, they do not provide specific details about the product being discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The other elements in the MEMORY, such as Neighbors A's personal improvements or the reassurance about the dog, are not directly relevant to the current conversation about the product. The MEMORY is mostly coherent but lacks direct connection and specific relevance to the current dialogue about the product."
