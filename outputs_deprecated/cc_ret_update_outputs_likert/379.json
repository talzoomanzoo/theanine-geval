    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to share something with you. I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend. Classmates B: That's really kind of you. What did you do to help? Classmates A: She was moving and needed some extra hands to pack up her things and load them onto a truck. So I spent most of the day helping her out. Classmates B: Wow, that's really generous of you. I'm sure your neighbor really appreciated it. Classmates A: I hope so. I just felt like it was the right thing to do. I know if I were in that situation, I would appreciate any help I could get. Classmates B: Absolutely. It's important to be there for each other, especially in tough times.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support.\n2. Classmates A appreciates the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n3. Classmates B handled a previous mix-up with the class schedule well, showing responsibility and reliability.\n4. Classmates B was initially worried about Classmates A going out with friends but they value each other's opinions.\n5. Classmates A and B value their friendship and feel comfortable talking to each other about anything.\n6. Classmates A and B started as acquaintances and have developed a strong friendship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Definitely. It's all about lending a helping hand when someone needs it most. I'm grateful to have friends like you who understand the importance of kindness and support.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains multiple sentences that give a sense of the positive relationship and friendship between Classmates A and B, which could be beneficial context for generating responses about interpersonal dynamics. However, the memory does not provide substantial development, causality, or connection that would directly help in crafting a response to the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT about helping out a neighbor. While the MEMORY demonstrates general camaraderie and appreciation between the classmates, it lacks specific content or phrasing that would help the conversation flow naturally in this particular context. Thus, it is not particularly helpful for generating a relevant follow-up response, leading to a low score."
