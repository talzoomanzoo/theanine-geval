Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I know you know something about my past. Can you tell me what it is? Classmates B: I'm sorry,, but I can't disclose that information. It's not my place to tell. Classmates A: But how did you find out? I haven't told anyone. Classmates B: Let's just say I have my ways of finding out things. But don't worry,, it's nothing bad or embarrassing. Classmates A: Okay, but it's still bothering me that you know something about me that even my closest friends don't know.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B warns Classmates A about the potential danger of dark alleys.\n2. Classmates A is curious and open to exploring new things and taking risks.\n3. Classmates B advises Classmates A to be careful and aware while on the bus.\n4. Classmates A was nervous about fitting in but saw Classmates B as well-liked and wanted to be friends with them.\n5. Classmates A encountered a mysterious woman in a dark alley, finding her intriguing.\n6. Classmates B appreciates the genuine friendship and positive attitude of Classmates A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information about the personalities and interactions between Classmates A and B, with references to curiosity, friendship, and advisory warnings. However, the sentences in MEMORY lack specificity in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on a mysterious aspect of Classmate A's past that Classmate B is aware of. The MEMORY does not provide clear connections or developments to inform the current conversation about the knowledge Classmate B has and its implications. While some aspects of their relationship are touched upon, such as Classmate A's curiosity and Classmate B's appreciation, they don't enhance the understanding of the current dialogue's pressing issue. Therefore, MEMORY provides limited helpfulness for generating a relevant and informed next response."
