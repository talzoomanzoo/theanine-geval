Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me. Co-workers B: That's amazing to hear. Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job. Co-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work. Co-workers B: It's great to have that kind of positive reinforcement. Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated? Co-workers A: Oh yeah, I remember. I was so angry after blowing up that rabbit with the dynamite. But talking it out with you really helped me work through my emotions. Co-workers B: That's right. It's important to have someone to talk to when you're feeling overwhelmed or upset. Co-workers A: And speaking of talking it out, do you remember when I was a kid and I ran to our parents screaming because of that spider?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.\n2. Co-worker A had a tough week on set, feeling overwhelmed and chaotic.\n3. Co-worker B acknowledges that some people have fears and suggests finding healthy ways to deal with frustrations.\n4. Co-worker A and Co-worker B met on a movie set and are now good friends.\n5. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to try relaxation techniques or find a hobby to de-stress and overcome fears.\n6. Co-worker B and Co-worker A met on a movie set where Co-worker A was focused on acting.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and assists in constructing a potential next response. Specifically:\n\n1. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot. (Relevant to the discussion about their supportive interaction and positive reinforcement.)\n2. Co-worker A had a tough week on set, feeling overwhelmed and chaotic. (Aligns with the context where Co-worker A mentioned feeling frustrated.)\n3. Co-worker B acknowledges that some people have fears and suggests finding healthy ways to deal with frustrations. (Relates to the context of Co-worker A feeling angry and needing to talk it out, as well as Co-worker A's childhood story about the spider.)\n4. Co-worker A and Co-worker B met on a movie set and are now good friends. (Provides background on their relationship, which is beneficial for understanding the context of their interactions.)\n5. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to try relaxation techniques or find a hobby to de-stress and overcome fears. (Relevant to Co-worker B's supportive role in the dialogue context.)\n6. Co-worker B and Co-worker A met on a movie set where Co-worker A was focused on acting. (Provides more background context, although repetitive with point 4.)\n\nOverall, this MEMORY effectively captures the relevant themes and context of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT while offering naturally phrased sentences that could guide the language model in generating a coherent, contextually appropriate next response. The information about collaboration, dealing with frustration, and their friendship is particularly pertinent. However, the MEMORY has some repetition and does not explore deeper nuances of their past interactions, which is why it did not receive a perfect score."
