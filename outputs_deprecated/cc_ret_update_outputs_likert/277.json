Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel really fulfilled as a leader and guide. Helping others gives me a sense of purpose. Co-workers B: I can see that. You always seem to know just what to do to make people feel better. Co-workers A: Yeah, I've had a lot of practice over the years. It's just something that comes naturally to me. Co-workers B: Do you remember that time when you were led to a safe place by the commander? You must have felt pretty grateful for his guidance then.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A had a positive experience with a commander who helped them feel safe.\n2. Co-worker B values finding fulfillment in work, pursuing hobbies, making a difference in the world, and building relationships with others.\n3. Co-worker B emphasizes the importance of acknowledging privileges and using them to make the world a better place.\n4. Co-worker A believes that everyone has the ability to create opportunities and make their own luck through hard work and seizing opportunities.\n5. Co-worker A is self-aware about being stubborn and needing to learn to compromise.\n6. Co-worker A values making money and is interested in opportunities to do so.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, that experience really showed me the impact a great leader can have. It's moments like that which remind me of the importance of being there for others in times of need.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains several relevant details that can be useful for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, point 1 directly relates to the discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Co-worker A feeling safe due to the commander's guidance, which aligns with the conversation's focus on leadership and guidance. Additionally, point 4 relating to Co-worker A's belief in making luck through hard work somewhat aligns with the dialogue's theme of personal development and empowerment, as seen in the mention of Co-worker A's natural ability to help others.\n\nHowever, points 2, 3, 5, and 6, though structured well and providing insight into the personalities and values of the co-workers, do not directly connect to the current conversation's focus on leadership and fulfillment through helping others. They introduce unrelated themes such as acknowledgment of privileges, compromise, and financial opportunities, which do not aid in developing the conversation further towards the current context.\n\nOverall, while some sentences are indeed relevant and structured to help develop a response, others are not immediately helpful in the given dialogue, which results in a moderate score of 3 for helpfulness."
