Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there.\n2. Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.\n3. Neighbor A's old apartment building was not the best place to live in.\n4. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have a close friendship and have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n5. Neighbor A finds solace in nature and believes that it helps in coping with their emotions.\n6. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information that can aid a language model in generating responses related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Neighbor A is expressing disbelief and sadness about a breakup. Sentences 2, 5, and 6 are particularly relevant as they highlight Neighbor A's grieving state, their coping mechanism through nature, and Neighbor B’s supportive role, respectively. These elements offer insights into Neighbor A's emotional state and the dynamics of their relationship with Neighbor B, which can be useful for generating empathetic and contextually appropriate responses. Although some sentences (such as 1 and 3) may not directly relate to the immediate context of the breakup, they are structured naturally and contribute to a broader understanding of Neighbor A’s background. Overall, the MEMORY is cohesive enough to demonstrate the development and relevancy of past interactions between the neighbors, thereby helping to craft suitable future dialogue."
