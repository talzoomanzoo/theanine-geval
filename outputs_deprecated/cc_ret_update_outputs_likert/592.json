Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work. Wife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help. Husband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff. Wife: Nonsense! You can always come to me with anything. Plus, I enjoy helping you with your creative process. Have you also tried revisiting some of the writing prompts we did in our creative writing class? Husband: I have, but I feel like I'm just repeating the same stories over and over again. Wife: Maybe it's time to take a step back and try something new. Have you ever tried writing in a different genre or experimenting with different styles? Husband: That's a good idea. I guess I just haven't had the courage to step out of my comfort zone. Wife: Remember when you faced your fear of public speaking during your fifth-grade presentation? You can do this too. Sometimes, the biggest breakthroughs come from taking risks.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The wife reassures the husband that it's okay to be different and encourages him to embrace who he is.\n2. Wife suggests that husband should try using more modern language to be better understood.\n3. Husband agrees to try adapting to modern language for better communication with his wife.\n4. The wife remembers the husband being nervous before the presentation.\n5. The wife compares the situation to when the husband fell asleep during a movie she recommended, indicating past issues in their relationship.\n6. Wife brings up Sarah, the husband's previous partner, but husband says he hasn't thought about her much.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You're right. I did manage to push through my fear back then, so I can definitely do it again with my writing. Thanks for the encouragement and for believing in me, it means a lot. I'll give it a try and see where it takes me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information, but it's not entirely cohesive with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context focuses on the husband's struggle with writing and the wife's suggestions and support. The MEMORY includes some potentially helpful elements, like the wife's reassurance and the reference to facing fears (sentence 4), which ties back to the wife's encouragement in the dialogue. However, other sentences, like those mentioning modern language usage (sentences 2 and 3) and the previous partner Sarah (sentence 6), are less relevant to the current context of writing struggles. Additionally, the connection between sentences could be improved to provide clearer development of past interactions. Overall, while there are helpful elements, the MEMORY lacks a coherent connection to the specific issues discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
