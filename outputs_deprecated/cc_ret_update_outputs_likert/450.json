Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B are students in the same class.\n2. Classmates A offered help and support to Classmates B.\n3. Classmates A was worried about a situation but it turned out to be not a big deal.\n4. Classmates A and B are close and have a level of trust between them.\n5. Classmates A discovered a secret that Classmates B has been keeping.\n6. Classmates A invited Classmates B to join the study group together for extra support and studying.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided is quite informative and helpful in understanding the relationship between Classmates A and B, which aids in generating an appropriate response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY reveals that both classmates are in the same class (1), indicating a shared environment. It also notes that Classmates A has offered help and support to Classmates B (2), which suggests a support dynamic that could be relevant to the forthcoming conversation. Furthermore, it highlights their close relationship and established trust (4), which is critical for understanding the context of their conversation, especially when A wants to discuss something serious. There is also mention of a secret (5), which might influence the current topic of discussion. Additionally, the MEMORY includes their involvement in a study group (6), demonstrating past cooperative interactions. Each of these points help in understanding the possible emotional background and the nature of the conversation A wants to initiate. However, some entries, like A worrying about a situation that wasn't significant (3), are less directly linked to what might be discussed next and could be considered less useful, affecting the perfect score. Still, the general structure and content of MEMORY are well-connected and relevant."
