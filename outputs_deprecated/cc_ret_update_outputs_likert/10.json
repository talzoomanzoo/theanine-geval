Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life. Child: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you. Parent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you. Child: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you? Parent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference. Child: I'm glad you found someone to talk to. You know, I remember when we watched the sunrise together a few weeks ago. That was really special. Parent: It was. I love being able to appreciate the beauty of nature. And you know, having my own place to live in the suburbs makes it even easier to do things like that. Child: Yeah, your house is really nice. You've always been good at taking care of yourself. Parent: Well, I've always valued my independence. Even as a kid, I wanted to do things on my own. That's why I decided to live on my own a few years ago. Child: I can see why you would want to do that. You're just really good at being self-sufficient. Parent: Thanks for saying that. But I still think one of the most important things I can do for others is listen. Whether it's to give advice, or just to let someone feel heard.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The parent values independence and self-sufficiency.\n3. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n4. The parent now lives in a little house in the suburbs that they love.\n5. The child offers help and reassurance to the parent.\n6. The parent wants to provide a safe and stable environment for the child.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I think that's one of the things I admire most about you. Your ability to be independent, self-sufficient, and yet always there to listen and support others. It's a rare combination, and I'm lucky to have you as a role model.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY is relevant and helpful for generating a next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The elements in the MEMORY, such as the Parent valuing independence and self-sufficiency (point 2) and living in a little house in the suburbs they love (point 4), align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY accurately captures the Parent's values and living situation, which appear directly in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the Parent wanting to provide a safe and stable environment (point 6) and appreciating small moments even in difficult situations (point 1) are thematically consistent with the dialogue and suggest development in the interactions. The only slightly less relevant point is about the child's help and reassurance (point 5), which does not directly emerge in the context but can still generally apply. Overall, the MEMORY's information is naturally structured and connected, facilitating the language model's understanding of contextual cues."
