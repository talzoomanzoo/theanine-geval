Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax. Neighbors B: What kind of breathing exercise? Neighbors A: It's just a simple one, where you inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, and then exhale for eight seconds. I've been doing it every day for the past week and it's made such a difference. Neighbors B: That's really interesting. I've heard that breathing exercises can be really helpful for reducing stress and anxiety.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A is willing to take things slow in their relationship with Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbor B reassures Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasizes their current friendship.\n3. Neighbors A has developed romantic feelings for Neighbors B.\n4. Neighbors B values their friendship with Neighbors A.\n5. Neighbor A and Neighbor B found a park together a couple of years ago and enjoyed playing frisbee and having a picnic.\n6. Neighbors A ordered pizza for Neighbors B in the past.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, it's amazing how something as simple as breathing can have such a big impact on our well-being. I'm glad I found this technique, especially during busy times like these.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information about the past interactions between Neighbors A and Neighbors B. However, it does not provide any helpful context related to the topic of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about breathing exercises and their benefits. Most of the MEMORY details are about their relationship, friendship, and past activities together, which do not contribute to generating a relevant response in the current dialogue about breathing exercises. The MEMORY does not establish a clear causality or connection with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, thus limiting its helpfulness. Moreover, the sentences are not structured in a way that makes the relationship between the memory and the current dialogue clear or relevant for the language model to use effectively."
