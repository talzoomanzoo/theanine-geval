Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today? Classmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own. Classmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others. Classmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone. Classmates A: You're not a burden, don't worry. And I'm always here to help you out. Classmates B: I appreciate that, but I don't want to always rely on others. I want to be more independent. Classmates A: I get it. Maybe there are some small things you can do on your own to start feeling more independent? Classmates B: Like what? Classmates A: Well, maybe you can start by making a list of things you'd like to do on your own and we can work on achieving those goals together. Classmates B: That sounds like a good idea. Thanks for understanding, Classmates A. Classmates A: Of course, I'm always here to support you. Hey, speaking of goals, remember when we talked about your guitar playing a few months ago? How's that going?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as evidenced by their conversation about their respective experiences.\n2. Classmates B finds it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after a conversation they had about following dreams.\n3. Classmates A enjoys reminiscing about childhood memories, particularly about playing on swings and making music with friends.\n4. Classmates A and B enjoy jamming together and plan to collaborate on music in the future.\n5. Classmates B is interested in learning to play an instrument.\n6. Classmates A finds pursuing music rewarding and is passionate about it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't made much progress with learning the guitar yet, but I'm still interested in picking it up. Your dedication to music really inspires me to give it a shot.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains several sentences that provide relevant context and helpful information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The current dialogue ends with Classmates A asking about Classmates B's progress with guitar playing, which directly relates to the MEMORY containing details about their shared interest in music (sentences 2, 4, and 6). Classmates B's interest in learning to play an instrument (sentence 5) aligns with the dialogue topic of pursuing independence and goals. This relevance helps the language model generate the next response in a coherent manner. \n\nMoreover, there is a clear connection between the supportive nature of Classmates A and B's relationship as seen in the dialogue and MEMORY (sentence 1), reinforcing the background of their interaction. Even though some sentences (e.g., sentence 3 about childhood memories) are not directly tied to the specific context of seeking independence, they are phrased in a manner that logically fits within the framework of their friendship and past interactions. Therefore, the MEMORY provides a good degree of help in establishing context for the conversation."
