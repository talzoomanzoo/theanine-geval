Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life. Child: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n3. The parent values independence and self-sufficiency.\n4. The child offers help and reassurance to the parent.\n5. The parent wants to provide a safe and stable environment for the child.\n6. Both the parent and child enjoy spending time together in their new home.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad to hear that you feel heard when we talk. It's essential to create a safe space where we can communicate openly and support each other. Your willingness to listen and understand means a lot to me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant and helpful pieces of information that could aid a language model in generating an appropriate response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 5 and 6 directly pertain to the relationship between the Parent and Child, suggesting a safe environment and enjoyment in shared experiences, which aligns with the tone of valuing communication. Sentence 4 offers insight into the supportive dynamic, reinforcing their positive relationship. However, sentences 1, 2, and 3, while naturally phrased, are less directly relevant to the listening theme of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Although they provide background information, their connection to the immediate context is not as strong. Overall, the MEMORY is moderately useful in providing contextual cues but lacks stronger ties to the specific context of valuing listening."
