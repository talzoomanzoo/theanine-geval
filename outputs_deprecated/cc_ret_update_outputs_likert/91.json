    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you. Classmates B: Oh really? What are they? Classmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners. Classmates B: Wow, that sounds amazing! What kind of project are you thinking about?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n2. Classmate A and Classmate B enjoy singing karaoke together and look forward to future outings.\n3. Classmates A and B are open to meeting for coffee again in the future.\n4. Classmates A is looking forward to meeting up with Classmates B again after getting better sleep.\n5. Classmates A is social and enjoys meeting new people.\n6. Classmate B admires Classmate A's outgoing nature and wants to be more like them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I was thinking we could start a YouTube channel where we showcase our karaoke sessions and maybe even offer singing tips and tricks to our viewers. What do you think?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY includes several points that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Classmates A and B's positive interaction history (e.g., enjoying karaoke together, being open to future meetings, etc.), which establishes a foundation for their willingness to collaborate on a project. Additionally, Classmate B's admiration for Classmate A's outgoing nature may imply their willingness to engage in a joint venture. However, the specific details of the project or business aren't addressed, and some sentences (like looking forward to better sleep) are less relevant. Overall, the MEMORY does provide some helpful context, but it lacks specificity related to the business project discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
