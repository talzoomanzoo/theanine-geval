Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss! Co-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's competence and effort in their work.\n2. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.\n3. Co-worker A is seen as competent and reliable by Co-worker B.\n4. Co-worker A is known for being competent and is trusted with important projects.\n5. Co-worker A enjoys helping others and takes pride in their work.\n6. Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides moderately helpful information for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences in MEMORY highlight Co-worker A's competence, work ethic, and positive relationship with Co-worker B, which aligns with the context of Co-worker A asserting their role as the boss. This connection may help the language model generate a response that touches on the established respect and positive dynamics between the two co-workers. \n\nHowever, the MEMORY entries are repetitive and somewhat surface-level, lacking depth in detailing past interactions or specific events. This limits their usefulness in providing rich contextual cues for generating nuanced responses. Additionally, some of the sentences, while positive, might not add significant value to the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as they do not necessarily relate directly to the \"boss\" dynamic mentioned. Overall, the items in MEMORY are phrased clearly but could offer more detailed insights or examples to be rated higher."
