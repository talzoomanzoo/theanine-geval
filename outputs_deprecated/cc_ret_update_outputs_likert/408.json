Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned? Classmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed. Classmates A: Embarrassed? Why? Classmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier. Classmates A: Come on, tell me! I won't judge you, I promise. Classmates B: Well, I accidentally spilled my lunch all over myself in front of some people. Classmates A: (laughs) That's it? That's why you're embarrassed? I thought it was something serious. Classmates B: (sighs) Yeah, it's silly. But still embarrassing. Classmates A: Don't worry about it. It happens to everyone. Remember the time I tripped and fell in front of the whole class during our presentation? Classmates B: Oh yeah, that was pretty bad. But you handled it so well. You just got up, dusted yourself off, and continued with the presentation. Classmates A: Exactly! That's what you should do too. Own up to it and move on. Don't let it bother you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during the difficult situation.\n2. Classmates B praised Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n3. Classmates A helped Classmates B out of friendship and believes in supporting each other.\n4. Classmate A believes in doing their best at everything to avoid regrets later.\n5. Classmate B struggles with parallel parking but is grateful for Classmate A's patience.\n6. Classmate B praises Classmate A's attention to detail and work ethic as truly impressive.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You're right, Classmates A. Thanks for the reminder. I'll try to brush off the embarrassment and carry on. Your positive attitude always helps me see things in a better light.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does not provide much helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Most of the sentences in the MEMORY revolve around expressions of gratitude, praise, and general character traits, such as resilience, quick thinking, and work ethic. However, they do not directly relate to the current interaction between Classmates A and B or provide relevant context to the situation at hand (the embarrassing lunch incident). While some entries, like those involving support and handling situations, could imply a supportive relationship between Classmates A and B, they do not offer causality or specific past interactions that can aid significantly in generating the next response in the dialogue. The connections between sentences in MEMORY seem loosely tied, lacking clear relevance or narrative progression linked to the ongoing conversation."
