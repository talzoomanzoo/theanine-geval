    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around camping and necessary preparations. MEMORY contains information about community involvement, parties, and allergies, none of which is relevant to camping gear preparations. Therefore, MEMORY does not contain any relevant past information that helps generate a proper response about camping preparations.\nJudgement: No"
