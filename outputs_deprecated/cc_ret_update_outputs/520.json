    "raw_prediction": "Neighbor A, I understand how you're feeling right now. It's completely normal to have those thoughts, but please remember that your worth is not defined by someone else's actions. You are more than enough just as you are. If you ever need to talk or just spend some time together, I'm here for you.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT suggests a conversation about personal feelings of inadequacy, possibly related to a past relationship. The MEMORIES do not contain specific references to a past relationship or relevant emotional triggers that would aid in forming a response. They mostly focus on Neighbor A's bereavement, friendship with Neighbor B, and living situation, none of which are directly related to the reluctance to speak to someone (presumably an ex-partner).\nJudgement: \"No\""
