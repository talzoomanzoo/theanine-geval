    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context is about whether one has been in a physical altercation, a question focusing on personal physical experiences. The memory revolves around Co-worker A's experience with evidence collection and handling challenging clients, which is unrelated to physical altercations. Thus, the memory content does not provide information relevant to the context of physical altercations.\nJudgement: \"No\""
