    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves a question about why someone is feeling embarrassed. None of the memory entries address situations where Classmate A specifically felt embarrassed, nor do they provide context on why A might feel this way. The memories focus on gratitude, space incidents, friendships, and praises, none of which clearly relate to feeling embarrassed.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
