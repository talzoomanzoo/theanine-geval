    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves Classmates B asking about recent big projects. The MEMORY contains information about Classmate A's enthusiasm and plans for starting a business, which could be relevant if the project involves business initiatives. However, there's no direct link between the MEMORY and any specific recent project, and the context does not explicitly ask about business ventures.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
