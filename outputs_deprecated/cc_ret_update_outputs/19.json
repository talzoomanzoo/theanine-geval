It's wonderful that you have someone to spend time with outside of work. Keep nurturing those connections, and remember, friendships grow stronger with time and shared experiences.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT mentions the Mentee making a new friend at work, which is a personal and social development topic. The MEMORY provided does not contain any directly relevant information about the mentee's social life or making new friends at work. It primarily involves career and academic advice, decision-making, and a job opportunity, none of which directly connect to the current topic of discussion.\nJudgement: \"No\""
