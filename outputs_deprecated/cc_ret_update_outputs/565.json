    "raw_prediction": "That's a great approach, focusing on creating new positive memories is a wonderful way to balance things out. It's all about finding that balance between cherishing the past and embracing the present. If you ever need to talk more about it, I'm here to listen.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves Classmates B expressing feelings and a focus on creating new positive memories. The MEMORY does not provide any information directly related to B's emotional state or their process of creating new memories, nor does it mention past experiences of Classmates B related to such topics. Therefore, MEMORY does not contain helpful past information for responding to the dialogue context.\nJudgement: \"No\""
