    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context implies a possible follow-up or check-in of a previous event or conversation, but without specific information about the context of \"how did that go,\" it is unclear if the MEMORY entries provide helpful information. The MEMORY contains various interactions and values shared between the neighbors, but none of them seem directly relevant to the question at hand, making it hard to determine usefulness.\n\nJudgement: No"
