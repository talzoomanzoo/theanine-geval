The memory includes information about Co-worker B's supportive nature and their past collaborations, which may provide context for the supportive tone. However, since the response is straightforward and based on the congratulations, past information about encouragement or past teamwork is not directly necessary for generating the next response. \n\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
