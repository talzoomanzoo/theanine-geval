    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The Dialogue Context suggests a negative and confrontational interaction between Classmate A and someone else, likely Classmate B. The Memory provides information about a positive relationship between Classmates A and B. This discrepancy in tone and relationship suggests that the Memory does not contain information relevant to understanding or resolving the current conflict depicted in the Dialogue Context.\nJudgement: \"No\""
