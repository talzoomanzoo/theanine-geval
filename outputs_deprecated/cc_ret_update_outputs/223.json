    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT \"Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen?\" suggests that Neighbor B is asking about a specific and extraordinary event that occurred. MEMORY doesn't contain any information specifically about an incredible event. While MEMORY contains background on recent changes in Neighbors A's life (such as making a career change), it does not explicitly tie to the \"incredible\" thing Neighbor B is inquiring about. Thus, MEMORY lacks pertinent information that directly relates to generating a response to the question in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nJudgement: No"
