    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves the Mentee expressing gratitude to the Mentor for finding their glasses. The information from MEMORY primarily revolves around the Mentor's ongoing support, the Mentee's sobriety journey, and their achievements. This past information does not directly relate to the current context of finding glasses, which is more of an immediate and specific event rather than something requiring historical context on sobriety or life changes.\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
