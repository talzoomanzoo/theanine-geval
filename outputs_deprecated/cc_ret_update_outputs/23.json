    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT hints at a situation where someone was pushed into cold water, possibly as a joke or prank. The MEMORY does not provide any specific information about an incident involving someone being pushed or an event connected to cold water. Therefore, the past information in the MEMORY isn't helpful for generating a proper response about the current context.\nJudgement: No"
