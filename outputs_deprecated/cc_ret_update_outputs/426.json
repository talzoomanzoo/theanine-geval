    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT refers to a specific childhood memory of Co-worker A running to their parents due to fear of a spider. This requires past information specific to Co-worker A's childhood experiences, but the provided MEMORY focuses on their professional relationship and stress management strategies. None of the MEMORY entries mentions Co-worker A's childhood or fears specifically related to spiders.\nJudgement: No"
