    "raw_prediction": "I completely agree, Mentor. Learning about different cultures can really open our minds and help us appreciate diversity. It's inspiring to see how people from different backgrounds live and think.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on learning about other cultures and perspectives, which is unrelated to MEMORY's focus on teaching religion and making a positive impact. Therefore, MEMORY does not contain past information helpful for generating the next response in the current dialogue context.\nJudgement: No"
