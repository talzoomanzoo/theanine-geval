    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT discusses Classmate A's issue with getting caught cheating on taxes. However, the MEMORY provided focuses primarily on encouragement and support for Classmate A's pursuits and doubts related to personal goals and aspirations, rather than legal or cheating-related issues. Therefore, there is no relevant past information in MEMORY that would help address Classmate A's current situation.\nJudgement: No"
