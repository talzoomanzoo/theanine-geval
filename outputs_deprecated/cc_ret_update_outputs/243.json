    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves Co-worker A sharing an experience of singing a solo at church. The memory does not contain any information related to Co-worker A's singing talent or experiences at a church, nor does it provide relevant context for acknowledging or responding to A's solo singing. Thus, the memory is not helpful.\nJudgement: No"
