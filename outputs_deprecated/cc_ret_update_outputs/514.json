    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves Classmates B saying they have ways of finding out things but assures Classmates A it's nothing bad or embarrassing. The MEMORY does not contain any specific past information that would provide context for why Classmates B would have “ways” of finding out information or why Classmates A should be concerned. Therefore, no relevant past information supports the current dialogue context.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
