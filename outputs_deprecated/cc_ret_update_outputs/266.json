    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT refers to a specific instance of the husband catching a bus a few months ago. MEMORY item 4 mentions a similar event, but it occurred a couple of years ago. Thus, the MEMORY does not specifically contain information about the recent instance referenced in the dialogue. \n\nJudgement: No"
