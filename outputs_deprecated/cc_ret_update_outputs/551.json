    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves Classmate B expressing a desire to be more independent. While the memory provides some information about their relationship and mutual activities, this information does not directly relate to the need for independence or how Classmate A can support or respond to Classmate B's statement in a relevant way. The context does not specifically draw upon past experiences or shared activities relevant to the conversation about independence. \n\nJudgement: No"
