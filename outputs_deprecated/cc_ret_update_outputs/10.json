    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves the Parent expressing their belief in the importance of listening. MEMORY does not contain specific past information that is directly related to enhancing this particular sentiment or conversation about listening. The MEMORY points are fairly general or unrelated to the topic of listening, such as housing, providing a stable environment, or past appreciation of the parent's story.\nJudgement: \"No\""
