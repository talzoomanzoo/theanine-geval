The MEMORY section provides information that Co-worker B has previously been supportive and reassuring to Co-worker A, particularly in regard to a past incident where Co-worker A felt guilty. This past behavior of Co-worker B could be relevant for generating a supportive or understanding response.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
