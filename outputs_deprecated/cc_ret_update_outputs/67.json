    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves Classmate A expressing envy toward Classmate B's singing talent. The memory contains details about their good relationship, mutual admiration, and shared interests in academics. Although the memory provides information about their positive relationship and interests, it does not directly address Classmate B's singing talent or any relevant past interactions about singing. Therefore, the memory does not contain specific past helpful information for generating an appropriate response to the expression of envy.\nJudgement: No"
