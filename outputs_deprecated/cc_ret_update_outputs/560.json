    "raw_prediction": "That actually sounds like a great idea! Having a performance goal to work towards could really help me push past my nerves. Thanks for always believing in me and supporting my musical journey, Classmates A.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The context involves Classmates A acknowledging the fear related to performing and suggesting setting a goal for a small performance. The memory mostly contains information about the supportive relationship and shared musical interests between Classmates A and B. This could potentially relate, as the supportiveness and past desire to pursue music (Memory 1, 2, 3) might scaffold A's encouragement.\nJudgement: Yes"
