    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves a conversation about cheating and getting caught, which is unrelated to the supportive interactions and encouragements mentioned in memory. The statements in memory do not address cheating or related consequences but focus on encouragement, confidence, and teamwork, making them unhelpful for generating an appropriate response to the dialogue context.\n\nJudgement: No"
