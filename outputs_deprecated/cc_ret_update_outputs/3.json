    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves the child asking the parent about their past experience in detention, questioning whether they felt unheard. Memory point 4 discusses the parent's past trouble, which may imply a similar experience to being in detention, though it's not specific about feeling unheard. This has the potential to be relevant background.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
