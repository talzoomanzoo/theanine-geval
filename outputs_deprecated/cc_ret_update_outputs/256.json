    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves Co-worker B asking about a teacher and whether Co-worker A knows about her recent activities. The MEMORY only provides information about Co-worker A and Co-worker B's personal lives and past work-related experiences, none of which involve the teacher in question. Therefore, the contents of MEMORY do not relate to the teacher being discussed or provide helpful past information for generating a response to the question about the teacher.\nJudgement: \"No\""
