    "raw_prediction": "It's normal to feel that way sometimes. Maybe it's time to explore new genres or writing styles to spark some fresh ideas. Remember, it's all about embracing who you are as a writer and finding your unique voice. How about trying to write a short story from a completely different perspective?",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT references feelings of repetition in storytelling, which might relate to past communication challenges between the husband and wife. MEMORY 2 and 4 are relevant as they correspond to the wife suggesting the husband use more modern language (an attempt to change and perhaps avoid repeated stories) and the husband's agreement to adapt. This past suggestion and agreement might help understand the current context better.\nJudgement: Yes"
