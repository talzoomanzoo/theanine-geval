I thought we were happy together.\nNeighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left?\nNeighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him.\nNeighbors B: That's not true, Neighbor A. You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are.\nNeighbors A: I just feel so lost right now. I don't know how to move on from this.\nNeighbors B: It's going to take time, but you will get through this. Do you want to talk about how you're feeling or do something to take your mind off of things?\nNeighbors A: Maybe both? I just feel so overwhelmed and I don't know what to do.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A has a bit of a drive to get to the park where they are meeting with Neighbor B. This is because Neighbors A and Neighbors B enjoy going for walks together, especially to the park. Neighbor A appreciates the emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during their time of grief.\n\nNeighbor A recently moved into the neighborhood and wanted to live in a nicer area. As a result, Neighbor B enjoys taking walks in the park after work to clear their mind. After their activities, Neighbors A and Neighbors B like to grab a bite to eat together. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n\nTired of living in a run-down apartment complex and wanting to improve their quality of life is the reason why Neighbor A and Neighbor B are neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood. Additionally, Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.",
