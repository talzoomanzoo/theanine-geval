    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY mainly focuses on past interactions between Classmates A and B concerning making new friends, enjoying karaoke, and meeting for coffee. It touches upon some of Classmate A's regrets about academic performance but does not extensively cover their journey overcoming these struggles. The current DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves more heavily around their future business plans and Classmate A's progress with personal challenges such as sleep issues and past struggles with school and friendships. There is a slight connection in terms of Classmate A's academic regrets, but the MEMORY does not provide information that directly aids in generating a more relevant, informed response in terms of their conversation about business plans or overcoming past struggles.\n\nJudgement: No"
