I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\nMentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering.\nMentor: And remember, it's also important to keep in touch with your old friends. You can schedule video calls or even plan a visit back home.\nMentee: That's true, I'll make sure to keep in touch. Thanks for the advice, Mentor.\nMentor: Anytime, Mentee. Is there anything else you want to talk about or any updates you'd like to share?\n\nMEMORY:\n- The Mentor has been guiding and supporting the Mentee in their work for years. This has led to the Mentor being supportive and praising the Mentee for their mature decision-making process, which made the Mentee agree to go back to the store to make things right and express gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n- The Mentor believes the Mentee's work has been influential and that they will continue to make an impact in the world. This resulted in Mentor reassuring Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n- The Mentee hopes to inspire others to join the cause of gender equality and fighting discrimination. As a result, the Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process, causing the Mentee to agree to go back to the store to make things right and express gratitude for the mentor's advice.",
