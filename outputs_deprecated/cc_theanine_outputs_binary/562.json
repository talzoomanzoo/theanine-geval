I wish I could do things on my own.\nClassmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others.\nClassmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone.\nClassmates A: You're not a burden, don't worry. And I'm always here to help you out.\nClassmates B: I appreciate that, but I don't want to always rely on others. I want to be more independent.\nClassmates A: I get it. Maybe there are some small things you can do on your own to start feeling more independent?\nClassmates B: Like what?\nClassmates A: Well, maybe you can start by making a list of things you'd like to do on your own and we can work on achieving those goals together.\nClassmates B: That sounds like a good idea. Thanks for understanding, Classmates A.\nClassmates A: Of course, I'm always here to support you. Hey, speaking of goals, remember when we talked about your guitar playing a few months ago? How's that going?\nClassmates B: It's going really well, thanks for asking! I've been practicing every day and I feel like I'm getting better.\nClassmates A: That's awesome! Have you thought about joining a band or playing gigs around town?\nClassmates B: Not really, I'm still a bit nervous about performing in front of people.\nClassmates A: I get it, performing can be scary. But maybe in a few months, we can work on setting a goal for you to do a small performance somewhere.\nClassmates B: That sounds like a challenge, but also kind of exciting. I'm in!\nClassmates A: Great, I'm looking forward to seeing you rock out on stage. Hey, remember when we talked about your new car a few hours ago? How's that going?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as evidenced by their conversation about their respective experiences in keeping up with the homework in their math class.\n2. Classmates B finds it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after a conversation they had about following dreams. This is in line with their shared interest in keeping up with the homework in their math class.\n3. Classmates A, who plays the guitar, takes lessons, and plays in a band, wants to own a Mustang GT, a dream they have had since childhood.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY provided does not include any specific past information about Classmates B's goals, independence, or music practice that could directly assist in generating a meaningful next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Instead, it mainly focuses on Classmates A's musical interests and aspirations, which are not directly relevant to Classmates B's current journey towards independence and potential performance anxiety. Additionally, the MEMORY revolves around experiences not cited in the dialogue, diminishing its utility in crafting an appropriate response.\nJudgement: \"No\""
