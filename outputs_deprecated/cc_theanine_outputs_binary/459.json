I just can't stop thinking about you.\nClassmates B: Oh, really?\nClassmates A: Yes, really. I know we've been friends for a while now, but I feel like there may be something more between us.\nClassmates B: Hmm, I never thought about it that way.

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT indicates a personal conversation between two classmates discussing the possibility of moving from friendship to a romantic relationship. MEMORY entries primarily involve academic support, shared admiration for courage, trust issues due to rumors, and mutual relief in confiding secrets. While MEMORY reflects supportive and compassionate interactions, these aspects do not contain specific past helpful information about feelings of romance or personal emotional history between the two.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
