    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains information that Classmates A tends to overthink things and appreciates Classmates B's support and advice. This context helps provide a backdrop for Classmates B to understand the seriousness and sincerity behind Classmates A's feelings expressed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, Classmates A's hesitance due to high standards and their overthinking nature may suggest that confessing feelings is a significant step for Classmates A, and could guide Classmates B in responding supportively.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
