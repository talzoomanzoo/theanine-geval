I'm a millionaire now!\nNeighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen?\nNeighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest.\nNeighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations! What are you going to do with all that money?\nNeighbors A: Well, first I'm going to pay off my mortgage and all my debts. After that, I think I'll take a nice long vacation and maybe donate some to charity.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A is feeling stagnant in their current job and is looking for more growth and challenge. This led to Neighbors A making a big career change recently and feeling much happier now. \nNeighbors B is tired from work and needs to catch up on sleep, which causes Neighbors B to be supportive of Neighbors A's job search, offering to connect them with people in different industries. \nNeighbors A appreciates Neighbors B's understanding and willingness to listen and talk about the experience, leading to Neighbor A suggesting planning something else to do together over the weekend.",
