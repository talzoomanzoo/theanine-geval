You don't have to remind us every five minutes.\nCo-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan.\nCo-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway.\nCo-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way.\nCo-workers B: And sometimes it is, but we all have different ideas and perspectives to bring to the table.\nCo-workers A: Okay, I see your point.

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about Co-worker A returning Co-worker B's watch, which is directly relevant to the dialogue context where Co-worker B mentions appreciating that gesture. This provides understanding of the past event referenced in the conversation. However, the information about Co-worker A's teddy bear is not directly relevant to the current dialogue context; it does not connect with Co-worker B's query about the baby doll and rattle. \n\nJudgement: Yes"
