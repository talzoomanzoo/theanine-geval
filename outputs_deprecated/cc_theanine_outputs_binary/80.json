Plus, maybe you can compromise and go to the dinner for a little while and then come back home to relax.\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of compromise, remember that dinner we went to a few days ago?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation. Neighbors A mentions the practical uses of telekinesis, like grabbing things from a distance, which causes Neighbors A to gain the ability to move objects with their mind. \nNeighbors B is open to trying new recipes and is excited to receive the chickpea curry recipe from Neighbors A. This leads to Neighbors A and B joking about the fun aspects of using telekinesis to surprise people, causing Neighbors A to feel overwhelmed but also excited about their new ability.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY provided revolves around Neighbors A and B's discussions about cooking, telekinesis, and Neighbors A's new ability to move objects with their mind. It does not mention anything related to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on Neighbors A hiding from their mom to avoid a family dinner. Therefore, the MEMORY does not contain relevant past information that would be helpful for generating a proper response related to the current situation.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
