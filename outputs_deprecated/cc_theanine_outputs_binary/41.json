I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A witnessed a fight and intervened to separate the two women. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.

The MEMORY mostly contains information about previous benign interactions between the co-workers and does not relate to the current ethical dilemma being discussed. \n\nJudgement: \"No\""
