I wish I could do things on my own.\nClassmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others.\nClassmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone.\nClassmates A: You're not a burden, don't worry. And I'm always here to help you out.\nClassmates B: I appreciate that, but I don't want to always rely on others. I want to be more independent.\nClassmates A: I get it. Maybe there are some small things you can do on your own to start feeling more independent?\nClassmates B: Like what?\nClassmates A: Well, maybe you can start by making a list of things you'd like to do on your own and we can work on achieving those goals together.\nClassmates B: That sounds like a good idea. Thanks for understanding, Classmates A.\nClassmates A: Of course, I'm always here to support you. Hey, speaking of goals, remember when we talked about your guitar playing a few months ago?

Have you thought about joining a band or playing gigs around town?\nClassmates B: Not really, I'm still a bit nervous about performing in front of people.\nClassmates A: I get it, performing can be scary.

I'm in!\nClassmates A: Great, I'm looking forward to seeing you rock out on stage. Hey, remember when we talked about your new car a few hours ago? How's that going?\nClassmates B: I'm loving it! It's so much fun to drive. Thanks for asking, Classmates A.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A and B have a supportive and friendly relationship, as shown by their conversation about their experiences with homework in math class. \nClassmates B is excited that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after discussing following dreams.

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that can help in generating a proper response. It provides insights into the supportive relationship between Classmates A and B, and also mentions Classmates A's interest in music and bands, which aligns with the guitar playing conversation in the dialogue. The supportive relationship is apparent in both MEMORY and DIALOGUE CONTEXT, and the shared interests of music and driving are discussed in both, making MEMORY useful for generating an informed and coherent response.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
