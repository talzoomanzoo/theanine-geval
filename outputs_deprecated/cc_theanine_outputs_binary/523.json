This context is helpful as it aligns with Neighbors B's actions in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Neighbor B is offering comfort and support to Neighbor A after a breakup. Having background information on their supportive relationship can aid in generating a response that continues this supportive interaction.\n\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
