This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\nTeacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation?\nStudent: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle.\nTeacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time?\nStudent: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The teacher's support and emphasis on safety led the student to appreciate their relationship and apologize for the incident. The teacher and student now share a positive and understanding bond.\n2. The teacher's advice on safety prompted the student to open up about feeling stressed, possibly contributing to the outburst.
