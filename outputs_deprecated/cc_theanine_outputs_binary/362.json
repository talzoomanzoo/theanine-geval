    "raw_prediction": "Public speaking can definitely be a powerful tool for communication and engagement. It's great that you find it enjoyable!",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context is about Co-worker A's enjoyment of public speaking for connecting with people and conveying a message. The memory primarily focuses on Co-worker A's experiences with collecting evidence, defending beliefs, and the importance of communication and setting expectations. This could be tangentially related to public speaking, but the memory doesn't specifically address public speaking skills, experiences, or events, which would be more directly relevant to the context.\nJudgement: No"
