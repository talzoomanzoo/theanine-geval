I didn't realize there was any confusion about that.\nNeighbors A: Well, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page. I don't want any misunderstandings in the future.\nNeighbors B: I understand. Is there anything else we should do to make sure we're clear about this?\nNeighbors A: I don't think so, but if you have any other suggestions, I'm open to hearing them.\nNeighbors B: No, I think the line is a good idea. It's clear and simple.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor B admires Neighbor A's career advancement, expresses interest in borrowing the personal development book, and offers to be more supportive by checking in on Neighbor A more often. \nNeighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B, and they both emphasize the importance of taking care of each other as neighbors. \nNeighbor A and Neighbor B went to a concert together in the past and had a great time, but recently, Neighbor A was promoted to manager and is struggling to adjust to the new responsibilities.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY information focuses on personal aspects and shared experiences between the neighbors such as career advancement, personal growth support, shared interests, and past social events. However, none of these details directly relate to the current discussion about property boundaries or contribute to the resolution of that specific context. The dialogue is concerned solely with physical property division, which is unrelated to the personal interactions and support described in the MEMORY.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
