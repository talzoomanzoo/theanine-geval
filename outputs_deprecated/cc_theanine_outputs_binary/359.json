It's important to stay hydrated and keep our energy levels up during long drives.\nCoach: Definitely. Speaking of energy levels, how's your nutrition plan been going? Have you been keeping up with eating healthy foods like those bean sprouts we talked about?\nAthlete: Yes, Coach. I've been incorporating more nutrient-dense foods like bean sprouts into my diet. And I've noticed a significant improvement in my overall energy levels and performance on the field.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe Coach advises the athlete on pre-game meals, emphasizing the need for a balance of carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats, as well as staying hydrated.
