This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\nTeacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation?\nStudent: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle.\nTeacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time?\nStudent: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then.\nTeacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going?\nStudent: It's going pretty well. I started with French, but now I'm considering taking up Spanish and German too. I want to become more well-rounded.\nTeacher: That's a great goal. Have you thought about any specific ways you could use your language skills?\nStudent: I would love to be able to travel more and speak with the locals in their native language. Maybe I could even teach my grandchildren some basic phrases.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe student wants to become more well-rounded by studying French at college and plans on learning Spanish and German as well. The teacher speaks Spanish and French fluently.\nThe teacher's encouragement to prioritize safety and continue helping others in need caused the student to mention feeling stressed lately, which may have led to the outburst. The student has already made plans with their daughter and son-in-law to visit more often and take the grandkids on trips.",
