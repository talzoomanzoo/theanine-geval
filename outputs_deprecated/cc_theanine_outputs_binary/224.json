    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY relates to Neighbors A's career change and Neighbors B's support, but it does not provide information that is directly relevant to Neighbors A becoming a millionaire through inheritance. The context is about a personal financial change, not a career one, so the MEMORY does not contain helpful past information for this context.\nJudgement: \"No\""
