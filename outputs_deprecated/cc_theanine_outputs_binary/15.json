But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\nMentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering.\n\nMEMORY:\n1.

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY provided does not contain specific information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about feeling lonely in a new city and seeking suggestions for making new connections. Instead, MEMORY entries discuss college application stress, an unrelated incident in a store, and career aspirations related to gender equality. These past experiences do not directly contribute to the current discussion or offer useful context for Mentor's next response.\nJudgement: \"No\""
