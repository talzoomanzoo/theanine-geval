This leads to Co-worker B reassuring Co-worker A that making mistakes is okay as long as they learn from them, and then encouraging them to have more confidence.\n- Co-worker A has made mistakes in the past but is trying to be more aware of their actions, causing Co-worker B to move on from their arrest and appreciate Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior. This leads to Co-worker B reminding Co-worker A of their progress and potential for success, as well as being supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A.",
