It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message.\nCo-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive.\nCo-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of convincing people, have you ever been in a physical altercation before?\nCo-workers A: Yes, unfortunately. But that doesn't mean I'm a danger to people. I just don't back down from a fight when I'm standing up for what's right.\nCo-workers B: That's understandable. Speaking of standing up for what's right, do you remember when you asked Karen for money and she was hesitant at first?\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I remember. But she eventually gave me the cash, and I was able to take care of what I needed to.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A believes their evidence is more compelling than the opposing side's evidence. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs, mentioning that Co-worker A's reputation may have influenced Karen's hesitation to give them money.\n\n2. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument. Co-worker A has presented evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past, denying that their reputation had any impact on Karen giving them the money.",
