What are they?\nClassmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners.\nClassmates B: Wow, that sounds amazing! What kind of project are you thinking about?\nClassmates A: I was thinking about starting a marketing agency specialized in social media.\nClassmates B: That's a great idea! I'd love to work with you on that. We could really make a difference in the industry.\nClassmates A: Yes, exactly!

Do you feel like you've moved on from that?\nClassmates A: Definitely. It's been a journey, but I've worked hard to overcome those obstacles. And now I feel like I'm finally on the right path.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A encourages Classmates B to initiate conversations and be friendly to make new friends, causing Classmates B to appreciate Classmates A's gesture of buying coffee. In reaction, Classmates A agreed to try the suggestion and thanked Classmates B for it, wanting Classmates B to encourage them to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n\nClassmate A suggests planning a picnic in the park or a hike for the next outing with friends, and both Classmates A and B plan to relax at home later in the day.
