What did you do there?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions. This leads to Co-worker B being supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable. Co-worker A recently moved to a new duplex with two floors, having their bedroom on the first floor and another room on the second floor. This change indicates that Co-worker A and their ex have both moved on from the breakup.\n\n- Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits, which prompts Co-worker B to be supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable.

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY provided primarily contains information about Co-worker A's personal life and struggles, such as their breakup, living situation, punctuality issues, and efforts to improve themselves. However, it does not mention any specific interactions, tasks, or experiences related to the post office that would directly help in generating a response to Co-worker A's recent visit to the post office. Therefore, the MEMORY does not contain helpful information regarding the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the post office visit.\nJudgement: \"No\""
