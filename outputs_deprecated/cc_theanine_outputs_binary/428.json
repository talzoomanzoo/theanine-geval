Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated?\nCo-workers A: Oh yeah, I remember. I was so angry after blowing up that rabbit with the dynamite. But talking it out with you really helped me work through my emotions.\nCo-workers B: That's right.

It was so much fun to create something beautiful with my own hands.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B emphasized the importance of learning from mistakes and working together as a team, causing Co-worker B to acknowledge that some people have fears and suggests finding healthy ways to deal with frustrations. This led Co-worker A to overcome fears and anxieties to create beautiful earrings. \nCo-worker B expressed disapproval of Co-worker A's actions and suggested talking to the director to address the stressful situation, which caused Co-worker B to encourage Co-worker A to try relaxation techniques or find a hobby to de-stress and overcome fears, ultimately leading Co-worker A to create beautiful earrings. \nCo-worker B expressed disapproval of Co-worker A's actions and suggested talking to the director to address the stressful situation, which caused Co-worker B to encourage Co-worker A to try relaxation techniques or find a hobby to de-stress and overcome fears.
