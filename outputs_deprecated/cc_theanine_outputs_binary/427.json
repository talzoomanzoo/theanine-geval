Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job.\nCo-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work.\nCo-workers B: It's great to have that kind of positive reinforcement. Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated?\nCo-workers A: Oh yeah, I remember. I was so angry after blowing up that rabbit with the dynamite. But talking it out with you really helped me work through my emotions.\nCo-workers B: That's right. It's important to have someone to talk to when you're feeling overwhelmed or upset.\nCo-workers A: And speaking of talking it out, do you remember when I was a kid and I ran to our parents screaming because of that spider?\nCo-workers B: Ha, yes I do! It's funny to think about now, but phobias are no laughing matter.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B emphasized the importance of learning from mistakes and working together as a team, which caused Co-worker A to acknowledge that some people have fears and suggests finding healthy ways to deal with frustrations. This led to Co-worker A overcoming fears and anxieties to create beautiful earrings.\n\nDuring the shoot, both Co-worker A and Co-worker B felt that their collaboration brought out the best in each other, leading Co-worker B to encourage Co-worker A to try relaxation techniques or find a hobby to de-stress and overcome fears. As a result, Co-worker A has grown as a person and as an artist, learning about empathy and compassion.\n\nAfter a tough week on set, Co-worker A mentioned a past event involving blowing up a rabbit with dynamite, indicating a history of poor coping mechanisms for frustration. This incident still angers Co-worker A, showing the need for better emotional management strategies.",
