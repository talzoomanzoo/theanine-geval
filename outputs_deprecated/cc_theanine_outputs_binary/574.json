Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A values their friendship with Neighbor B, describing them as a great neighbor, which causes Neighbor A to consider using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\nNeighbor A helped Neighbor B build a new house with amazing features, and in reaction, Neighbor B reminds Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them. This makes Neighbor A want to believe that plants need sunlight, water, and love to thrive.\nNeighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly, which causes Neighbor B to be grateful for the help and quick completion of the new home, resulting in Neighbor B receiving a new house built by Neighbor A and being grateful for the extra space.",

    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY does not contain information that is directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Neighbor A struggling to focus on a project. Instead, the MEMORY focuses on past events related to Neighbor A's skills in building houses and their friendship with Neighbor B. There is no connection between the topic of procrastination and the content of the MEMORY.\nJudgement: \"No\""
