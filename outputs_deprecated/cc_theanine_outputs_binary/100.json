What are they?\nClassmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners.\nClassmates B: Wow, that sounds amazing!

And I think our skills complement each other's so well.\nClassmates B: I totally agree.

I can't wait to see what the future holds for us.\nClassmates A: Me too. And honestly, it's a bit of a relief to finally have a solid plan for the future.\nClassmates B: Yeah, I get that. Speaking of the future, how have you been doing with your sleeping problems?\nClassmates A: It's been a slow process, but I've been making progress with it. I started doing yoga and meditation before bed, and that's been helping a lot.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate A encourages Classmate B to initiate conversations and be friendly to make new friends, which causes Classmates B to appreciate Classmates A's gesture of buying coffee. This leads to Classmates A agreeing to try the suggestion and thanking Classmates B for it, showing that Classmates B wants Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n\n2. Classmates A and B both enjoy socializing and going out to parties together, and they are open to meeting for coffee again in the future. This mutual interest in socializing also extends to both planning to relax at home later in the day. Additionally, Classmates B suggests meditation or breathing exercises to help Classmates A relax before bed, which causes Classmates A to consider talking to a therapist or counselor to address past issues.",
