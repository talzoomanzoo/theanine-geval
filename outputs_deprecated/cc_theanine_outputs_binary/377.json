So I spent most of the day helping her out.\nClassmates B: Wow, that's really generous of you. I'm sure your neighbor really appreciated it.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support, which is why they are looking forward to hanging out outside of school.

The current dialogue context focuses on Classmates A's actions and conversation surrounding helping a neighbor, which is unrelated to their mutual appreciation and plans outside of school.\nJudgement: \"No\""
