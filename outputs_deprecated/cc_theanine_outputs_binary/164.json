I always seem to misplace them.\nMentor: Not a problem, Mentee. I'm glad I could help. \nMentee: This actually reminds me of when I was struggling with substance abuse.

    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information about the Mentee's struggles with substance abuse, their journey to sobriety, as well as feelings of gratitude and personal growth. These aspects of MEMORY resonate with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Mentee discusses past issues with losing things due to substance abuse and the improvement after achieving sobriety. This connection can help the language model generate a response that acknowledges Menteeâ€™s progress and Mentor's influence on their journey.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
