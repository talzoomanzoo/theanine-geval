Did you get sunburned?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate A showed determination in fixing their spaceship after it was damaged in a meteor shower, causing Classmates B to suggest redirecting the ship towards a nearby planet or moon for help. This led to Classmates B praising Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space. \n2. Classmate A, stranded in space and running out of oxygen, started feeling lightheaded. This situation made Classmate A's perseverance in repairing the spaceship reflect their determination to not give up in challenging situations. Consequently, Classmates B praised Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space. \n3. Classmate A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during the difficult situation, reflecting their belief in doing their best at everything to avoid regrets later. This aligns with Classmate A's philosophy of giving 110% effort in everything they do.",

However, this information is not relevant to the current dialogue context, which pertains to Classmate B's appearance and whether they got sunburned. There is no connection between the topic of the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\nJudgement: \"No\""
