    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I believe it's important to try to understand different perspectives. It helps us empathize with others and see the world in a more compassionate way.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves the Mentee pondering the idea of thinking like another person, which doesn't directly connect to the escape plan, the idea of volunteering, or the shared experience of wanting to leave the cult mentioned in the MEMORY. The MEMORY primarily focuses on plans and feelings related to escaping an abusive cult and doesn't contain relevant information about imagining or understanding someone else's thought process.\nJudgement: \"No\""
