Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking?\nCo-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you.\nCo-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember that conversation. What about it?\nCo-workers A: Well, I wanted to share some good news with you. I've been recently promoted to the night shift and have been doing a great job. I think I've come a long way since those days.\nCo-workers B: That's awesome, congratulations! I'm proud of you and all the hard work you've put in. You've definitely grown and matured in the workplace.\nCo-workers A: Thank you, I appreciate that. But I have to admit, I'm still a bit nervous about being wrong. Remember when we talked about my constantly questioning myself and second-guessing my decisions?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember that. Is there anything specific that's been bothering you?\nCo-workers A: Not really, it's just a general feeling of uncertainty at times. But hey, speaking of uncertainty, do you remember when we talked about my love for singing a while ago?\nCo-workers B: Yes, I do. How's that been going for you?\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A has reflected on the situation that led to Co-worker B's arrest and feels remorseful. Co-worker B has moved on from their arrest and appreciates Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior. They also remind Co-worker A of their progress and potential for success.\n\nCo-worker A's actions in the past led to Co-worker B being arrested. However, Co-worker B has changed their opinion and now compliments Co-worker A's writing skills and reliability as a journalist. This change in behavior makes Co-worker B reassure Co-worker A and encourage them to have more confidence.\n\nCo-worker A's efforts to be more conscious of their impact on others have led them to prioritize reliability in their job. As a result, Co-worker A is nervous about making mistakes in their new position, despite their achievements.",
