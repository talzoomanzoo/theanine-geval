    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY focuses on Neighbors A's job situation and their feelings about it, as well as Neighbors B's support during that time. However, the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about Neighbors A's newfound wealth from an inheritance, which is unrelated to the job change and career growth details mentioned in the MEMORY. The MEMORY does not directly provide information that is needed to generate a response related to how Neighbors A plans to use their inheritance.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
