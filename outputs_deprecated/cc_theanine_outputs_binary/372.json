It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message.\nCo-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident.\nCo-workers A: Thank you!

I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive.\nCo-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of convincing people, have you ever been in a physical altercation before?\nCo-workers A: Yes, unfortunately. But that doesn't mean I'm a danger to people. I just don't back down from a fight when I'm standing up for what's right.\nCo-workers B: That's understandable. Speaking of standing up for what's right, do you remember when you asked Karen for money and she was hesitant at first?\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I remember. But she eventually gave me the cash, and I was able to take care of what I needed to.\nCo-workers B: That's good. And speaking of taking care of things, your carpentry skills are amazing. I loved the house you built for me last year.\nCo-workers A: Thanks! I really love building houses. It's a great feeling to take a blueprint and turn it into someone's dream home.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's craftsmanship in building a house for them. \nCo-worker A's confidence in their argument is praised by Co-worker B, who admires their courage to defend their beliefs. Co-worker A's reputation may have influenced Karen's initial hesitation to lend them money. \nCo-worker B is pleased with the house built by Co-worker A and is thinking about adding a deck to it.",
