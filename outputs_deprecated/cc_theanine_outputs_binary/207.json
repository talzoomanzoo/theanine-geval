I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader?\nCo-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago.\nCo-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality.\nCo-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes. But it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Remember when I was really stressed about you not liking me?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember.

My parents gave me a good scolding for that.\nCo-workers B: Well, all that matters is that you learn from your mistakes and keep moving forward. And hey, you're doing just that with this promotion.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader, which resonates with Co-worker A's aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizing the importance of communication. This growth in confidence over the years has led to Co-worker A feeling embarrassed for losing control of their emotions in the past.",
