How does it work?\nParent: Well, I create the ads myself, and then I post them on my website. People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them.\nChild: Do you think people will pay to see your ads?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Child suggests creating a schedule for chores to ensure everyone contributes equally. The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings.

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY relates mainly to household chores, the Parent aiming to be a better role model, and family dynamics, which do not directly connect to the topic of the Parent's new project and website involving advertisements. There is no indication in the MEMORY that it contains specific past information that would help the Parent in addressing the Child's inquiry about the project's viability or plans.\nJudgement: \"No\""
