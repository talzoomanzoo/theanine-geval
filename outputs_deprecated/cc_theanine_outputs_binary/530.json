    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains encouragement and general advice from Classmates B to Classmates A about staying focused on goals, believing in themselves, and seeking help. However, it does not directly relate to the issue of cheating on taxes, nor does it provide specific past information that would help address the current problem of dealing with the legal or ethical implications of cheating. The context of the encouragement and the dialogue context of cheating on taxes do not directly connect, making the MEMORY unhelpful for generating a response specific to the situation at hand.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
