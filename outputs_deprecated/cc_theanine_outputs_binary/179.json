People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them.\nChild: Do you think people will pay to see your ads?\nParent: I don't know yet, but I hope so. I've put a lot of effort into creating some eye-catching ads.\nChild: That sounds cool, but why do you want to make money from ads?\nParent: Well, I want to have some extra income coming in. Plus, I enjoy being creative and making things, so this is a great way for me to combine those passions.\nChild: I see.

This information is unrelated to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about the parent's new project involving creating ads and posting them on a website. There is no relevant information in MEMORY that would aid in generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\nJudgement: \"No\""
