I always seem to misplace them.\nMentor: Not a problem, Mentee. I'm glad I could help. \nMentee: This actually reminds me of when I was struggling with substance abuse. I would often lose things or forget where I put things because of my drinking. It's amazing how much clearer my mind is now that I'm sober.\nMentor: That's a great observation, Mentee. Sobriety can definitely improve your cognitive abilities and overall wellbeing.
