    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, I saw it! Your blog is awesome, and I love how you're supporting emerging artists. Keep up the great work!",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains information that Classmates A values independence, authenticity, trying new things, and personal growth, which can be relevant to promoting under-the-radar artists, as it might relate to highlighting authenticity and originality in art. However, the MEMORY does not directly relate to blogs or the specific topic of promoting artists, making it minimally helpful in this context.\nJudgement: No"
