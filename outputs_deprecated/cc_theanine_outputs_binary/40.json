    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about a past interaction where Co-worker A borrowed a pencil and felt guilty, and about an incident involving the police and thankful women. Neither of these pieces of information is related to Co-worker A's current plan about stealing the bride, and hence does not provide relevant context for generating a response in the current dialogue.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
