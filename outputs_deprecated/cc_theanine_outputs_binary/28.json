Let's just forget about it.\nNeighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again.\nNeighbors A: I won't.

But it was also a good workout.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A and B plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking. They have not seen each other in a while and are catching up. Neighbors A mentioned mowing the lawn with an old push mower, indicating they are responsible for the yard work.
