    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context involves a serious and concerning situation where Co-worker A is planning to do something illegal and unethical, and Co-worker B is attempting to discourage such behavior. The memory provided involves past helpful and supportive interactions, showing that Co-worker B is generally supportive, brave, and strong. However, none of these memories directly relate to the context of a serious ethical discussion about potential kidnapping or coercive actions. Therefore, the memory does not contain specific helpful information for addressing this unique situation.\nJudgement: No"
