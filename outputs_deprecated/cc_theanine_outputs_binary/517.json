    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context revolves around a conversation about a secret or private piece of information that Classmates B knows about Classmates A. The memory provided contains information about past interactions and general behaviors but does not specifically address any secret or confidential knowledge that Classmates B might have about Classmates A. Therefore, the memory does not contain helpful past information to craft a response that aligns with the dialogue context's focus on secrets or undisclosed knowledge.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
