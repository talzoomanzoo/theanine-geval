    "raw_prediction": "You're not bothering me at all. I enjoy helping you with your writing. Let's brainstorm together and see if we can come up with something new.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context focuses on the husband's struggle with writing and the option of brainstorming with the wife. The memory mostly contains information about the husband's and wife's interest in movies, a past presentation, and their desire for happiness and understanding. This information about movies and the past presentation is not relevant to solving the current issue about writing. The wife's willingness to share her passion and encourage the husband's uniqueness can subtly relate to supporting his writing, but it is not a clear linkage.\n\nJudgement: No"
