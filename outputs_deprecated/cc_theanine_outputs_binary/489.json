What did you learn specifically?\nClassmates A: Oh, a lot of things. I learned how to use different programs and software for different tasks, and how to choose the right one depending on what I need to do.\n\nMEMORY:\n- [Classmates A acknowledges the mistake and plans to learn from it.] - (React) - [Classmate B is a supportive friend who listens and offers to help.] - (HinderedBy) - [Classmates A and Classmates B are friends who help each other with schoolwork.] \n- [Classmates A acknowledges the mistake and plans to learn from it.] - (Changed) - [Classmates A has matured since then and learned from past mistakes.] \n- [Classmates B emphasizes the consequences of Classmates A's actions and the need for responsibility.] - (SameTopic) - [Classmates B and Classmates A used to dance a lot in middle school.]",
