What did you do there?\nCo-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done.\nCo-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends?\nCo-workers A: Ugh, don't remind me. That was such a disaster.\nCo-workers B: It was definitely not one of your finest moments. But it's good to see that you're being responsible now and taking care of things like sending packages.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A is trying to improve their punctuality and cut back on drinking, in an effort to be more responsible and avoid late nights out and expensive rides. Both co-workers show a supportive and caring attitude towards each other, with Co-worker B being supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life. Co-worker A recently moved to a new duplex with two floors, having their bedroom on the first floor and another room on the second floor, indicating that Co-worker A and their ex have both moved on from the breakup.",
