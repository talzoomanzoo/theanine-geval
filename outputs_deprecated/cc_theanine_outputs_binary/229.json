I'm a millionaire now!\nNeighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen?\nNeighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest.\nNeighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations! What are you going to do with all that money?\nNeighbors A: Well, first I'm going to pay off my mortgage and all my debts. After that, I think I'll take a nice long vacation and maybe donate some to charity.\nNeighbors B: That's very generous of you. Have you thought about investing any of it?\nNeighbors A: Yes, actually. I've been doing some research and I think I want to invest in some stocks and maybe even start my own business.\nNeighbors B: That sounds like a great idea. You have the opportunity to do so much with your newfound wealth.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A is tired from work and needs to catch up on sleep. This causes Neighbors A to feel stagnant in their current job and look for more growth and challenge, leading to a big career change that makes them much happier now. Neighbors B has been supportive of Neighbors A's job search, offering to connect them with people in different industries, and admires the courage it took.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about Neighbors A's job dissatisfaction, a career change for happiness, and Neighbors B's support, which does not directly relate to the context of Neighbors A talking about inheriting a fortune and planning to invest or start a business. The MEMORY is more about a past professional situation rather than their current financial situation and decisions.\nJudgement: \"No\""
