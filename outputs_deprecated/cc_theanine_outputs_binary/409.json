    "raw_prediction": "No problem, Classmates B. Just remember, we all have embarrassing moments, but it's how we handle them that matters.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context involves Classmates A helping to reassure Classmates B and drawing a parallel to a past embarrassing event of their own. The MEMORY does not contain any information about past embarrassing situations like the one discussed in the dialogue. Instead, the memory focuses on unrelated aspects such as experiences in space, teaching driving, and work ethics that are not directly relevant to the current conversation about dealing with embarrassment. \n\nJudgement: \"No\""
