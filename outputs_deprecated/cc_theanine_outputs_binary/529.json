    "raw_prediction": "You should never cheat, especially on something as serious as taxes. It's important to find legitimate ways to handle financial struggles. How can I support you through this?",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about Classmate B being supportive of Classmate A, their positive interactions, and their shared goals. While this context of support might indirectly relate to offering help with Classmate A's current tax issue, there is no direct mention of relevant financial advice or moral guidance related to cheating on taxes. The helpfulness is more about their overall supportive relationship, which could influence the tone of Classmate B's response rather than providing specific information or advice for this particular situation.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
