    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY section primarily contains information about past mutual admiration, support, and shared values between the classmates. Though it showcases a supportive relationship, it does not directly provide context-specific information relevant to Classmate B's current situation of feeling embarrassed about a trivial incident. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around a specific event that has led to Classmate B's embarrassment, and the MEMORY does not offer any past situation or information that is directly helpful in responding to this event.\nJudgement: \"No\""
