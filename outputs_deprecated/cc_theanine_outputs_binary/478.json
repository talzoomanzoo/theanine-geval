Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A's past experience with tough competition in middle school from a fast girl motivated them to improve, causing them to struggle with feeling competitive and the need to be the best at everything. As a result, Classmates A, who has not experienced similar pains in the past, is feeling worried about the situation.\n\n2. Classmates A, who is always looking to challenge themselves and improve their skills, reacts positively to Classmates B's support and suggestion to take a step back to find a balance. This leads to Classmates B offering to take Classmates A to the hospital, but Classmates A declines, saying they will manage, as they had a muscle strain in their arm but did not go to the hospital. \n\n3. Classmates B's acknowledgment of Classmates A's determination and competitiveness prompts them to offer support and suggest that Classmates A get their arm checked out, which leads to Classmate A having a muscle strain in their arm but not going to the hospital.",
