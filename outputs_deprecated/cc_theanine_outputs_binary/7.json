It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you?\nParent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference.\nChild: I'm glad you found someone to talk to. You know, I remember when we watched the sunrise together a few weeks ago. That was really special.\nParent: It was. I love being able to appreciate the beauty of nature. And you know, having my own place to live in the suburbs makes it even easier to do things like that.\nChild: Yeah, your house is really nice. You've always been good at taking care of yourself.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe parent's experience in juvenile detention led to a newfound appreciation for moments like watching the sunrise, which the child also cherishes.\nThe parent's ability to find hope in difficult situations caused them to move to a house in the suburbs, a decision supported by the caring child.\nThe child's support and care for the parent motivates them to plan future sunrise-watching moments together, reminiscent of their past experience.",

Thus, MEMORY provides helpful background that can inform the parent's response.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
