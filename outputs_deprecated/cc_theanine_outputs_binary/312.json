    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains details about Classmates B's personal interaction and friendship with Classmates A, including their plans to go to the mall together and how they handle their friendship. However, there is no relevant information in MEMORY that directly relates to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about the special attributes of their class and the overall sense of community and diversity. Thus, MEMORY does not contain helpful past information to assist in generating the next response in the dialogue about the class attributes.\nJudgement: \"No\""
