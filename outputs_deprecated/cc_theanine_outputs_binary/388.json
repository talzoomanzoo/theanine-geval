How about we go on a weekend getaway?\nWife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go?\nHusband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city.\nWife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change.\nHusband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think?\nWife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it.\nHusband: Great. I'll start looking for rental cabins right away.

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY provides insight into the general relationship dynamics between the husband and wife and their commitment to their future together. However, it does not provide specific past information relevant to the current discussion about a weekend getaway or rental cabins. The MEMORY's information is more about their general approach to projects and commitments rather than specific past experiences or preferences related to the weekend getaway discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nJudgement: No"
