How about we go on a weekend getaway?\nWife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go?\nHusband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city.\nWife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change.\nHusband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think?\nWife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it.\nHusband: Great. I'll start looking for rental cabins right away.

The husband's long-awaited actions are influenced by his promise to include his wife in his plans. The husband's determination to achieve his dreams causes him to act impulsively, leaving without the wife, reminiscent of a past disappointment when he broke a promise to wait for her.",

This ties directly into the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they are discussing going on a trip together, and the husband is expressing his excitement despite acknowledging his impulsivity. The MEMORY helps to understand the husband's motivation and concerns expressed in the dialogue.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
