Did you get sunburned?\nClassmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed.\nClassmates A: Embarrassed? Why?\nClassmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier.\nClassmates A: Come on, tell me! I won't judge you, I promise.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A showed determination in fixing their spaceship after it was damaged in a meteor shower, which caused Classmates B to suggest redirecting the ship towards a nearby planet or moon for help. This led to Classmates B praising Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n\n2. Classmates A and B have been on field trips to other planets or moons before, like Mars, leading to Classmate B admiring Classmate A's attitude as a good example for others. This admiration was reciprocated when Classmate A patiently and helpfully taught driving material to Classmate B, who also mentioned that Classmate A helped them prepare for a driving test, showcasing patience and dedication.\n\n3. Classmates A expressed gratitude for Classmates B's support during a difficult situation, reflecting Classmate A's perseverance in repairing the spaceship and determination to not give up in challenging situations. This led to Classmates B praising Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY provided revolves around experiences related to space adventures, field trips, and acts of support and admiration between Classmates A and B. However, the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about Classmates B feeling embarrassed due to a personal incident that happened earlier, which is unrelated to the experiences and themes described in the MEMORY. The MEMORY does not contain relevant or helpful information that could assist the language model in generating a response to the current dialogue about Classmates B's embarrassment.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
