It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message.\nCo-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive.\nCo-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of convincing people, have you ever been in a physical altercation before?\nCo-workers A: Yes, unfortunately. But that doesn't mean I'm a danger to people. I just don't back down from a fight when I'm standing up for what's right.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A believes their evidence is more compelling than the opposing side's evidence. This leads Co-worker B to commend Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs. Co-worker B is happy with the house built by Co-worker A and is considering adding a deck to the house.\n\nCo-worker A plans to present the evidence clearly and persuasively in court, which has led to Co-worker A presenting evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past. This, in turn, causes Co-worker A to deny that their reputation had any impact on Karen giving them the money.",
