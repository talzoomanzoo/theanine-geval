Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I really enjoy being a carpenter. It's a very fulfilling job. Classmates B: That's great to hear! How did you get into carpentry? Classmates A: My dad was a carpenter, so I grew up around it. I started by helping him out when I was young, and then I began to really enjoy it myself. Classmates B: That's awesome that you were able to learn from your dad and turn it into a career. Have you done any big projects lately? Classmates A: Yeah, I just finished building a custom bookshelf for a client. It was a challenging project, but I'm really happy with how it turned out. Classmates B: That's impressive! You must have a lot of skill to be able to build something like that. Classmates A: Thanks! It definitely takes a lot of practice and attention to detail. But I find it really rewarding to see a finished product that I created with my own two hands. Classmates B: I can imagine. It must also be nice to have a steady income from your work. Classmates A: Absolutely. It's a good feeling to be able to support myself and my family doing something that I enjoy. Plus, I never know what exciting project might come my way next.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate B is supportive and encourages Classmate A to pursue their dream.\n2. Classmates A is attending a seminar on starting a business and is excited about applying that knowledge to future plans.\n3. Classmates A appreciates the support and encouragement from Classmates B.\n4. Classmates B is supportive and encourages Classmates A in their business venture.\n5. Classmate B offers to support and potentially collaborate with Classmate A in the future.\n6. Classmates A has had a business idea for a while and is now taking steps to make it a reality.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's clear that your passion for carpentry shines through in your work. I'm really happy to see you doing something you love and finding success in it. If you ever need any support or collaboration in the future, count me in!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant cues that could be helpful to generate the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 3, and 4 align with the supportive nature of Classmate B, which is consistent with the interactions in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Classmate B praises and shows interest in Classmate A's work. Sentence 2 introduces a new aspect of Classmate A attending a seminar, which could be integrated into the conversation if it shifts towards discussing future plans or business ventures. Sentence 5 suggests a possible future collaboration, which could be relevant depending on the direction of the conversation. However, the MEMORY might have benefited from more direct references to carpentry or recent projects mentioned in the context. Overall, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful in continuing the dialogue but lacks specificity and more direct connection to the immediate context, thus warranting a score of 3."
