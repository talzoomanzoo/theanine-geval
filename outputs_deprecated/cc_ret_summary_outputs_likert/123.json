    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now! Neighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen? Neighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest. Neighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations! What are you going to do with all that money?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A made a big career change recently and is much happier now.\n2. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's decision and admires the courage it took.\n3. Neighbors A appreciates Neighbors B's understanding and willingness to listen and talk about the experience.\n4. Neighbors A and B had a conversation a couple of years ago about needing a change.\n5. Neighbors A took the leap to make a change and is glad they did.\n6. Neighbors B has been supportive of Neighbors A's job search, offering to connect them with people in different industries.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not directly connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Neighbors A has just become a millionaire through inheritance. Most of the sentences in the MEMORY focus on Neighbors A's career change and Neighbors B's support during that time, which are not directly relevant to the current context of inheriting a fortune. While some details about the supportive relationship between Neighbors A and B can indirectly indicate a positive dynamic, this information does not significantly aid in generating a response to the current discussion about the inheritance. The structure of MEMORY shows positive interactions but lacks direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which limits its helpfulness."
