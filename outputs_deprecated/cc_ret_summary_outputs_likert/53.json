Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today. Classmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about? Classmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held. Classmates B: Wow, that does sound interesting. Did you take any notes? Classmates A: Yes, I took lots of notes. I'm excited to study this topic more on my own time. Classmates B: That's awesome. It's great to see your enthusiasm for learning. Classmates A: Thanks. I've always been passionate about learning new things. Remember when we talked about how determined I was to get into college?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A is dedicated to studying hard and taking extra classes to get into a good college.\n2. Classmates B noticed Classmates A's improvement and acknowledged their hard work.\n3. Classmates A had a moment of frustration in the past but has learned to channel that energy into studies.\n4. Classmates A struggled with motivation but found a way to stay focused by thinking about the payoff of their hard work.\n5. Classmates A's grades are looking good according to their teacher.\n6. Classmates A is willing to work hard to achieve their dreams.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I definitely remember that conversation. Your dedication and hard work are truly inspiring. It's amazing to see how far you've come since then. Keep up the great work!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a strong background of Classmates A's dedication to learning and their academic pursuits, which is helpful to understand Classmates A's enthusiasm mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights Classmates A's determination, efforts, and strategies to succeed academically, which are relevant to the context where Classmates A is excited to study more about the pyramids after attending a talk. However, while the MEMORY provides relevant background information, it could be more directly connected, such as mentioning specific interactions between Classmates A and B or past conversations relevant to the pyramid talk or to studying diverse topics. Nonetheless, the sentences are naturally structured and provide useful context about Classmates A's personality and behaviors, which supports the model in generating informed responses based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
