Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going? Neighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbors A looks forward to playing with Neighbors B again when feeling better.\n3. Neighbors A and Neighbors B enjoy playing together with toys.\n4. Neighbors B is familiar with Neighbors A's dog and looking forward to playing with it again.\n5. Neighbors B expresses concern for Neighbors A's back pain.\n6. Neighbors A is enjoying the different culture and exploring the city.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provided contains relevant and helpful information that can assist in generating a proper response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions the support and friendship between Neighbors A and B, which establishes a positive relationship. This context is beneficial given the friendly greeting in the dialogue. Also, the mention of playing with toys together (point 3) and Neighbors A looking forward to playing with Neighbors B again (point 2) indicates a shared activity or bond, which can inform a potential topic in the conversation. The mention of Neighbors B's familiarity with Neighbors A's dog (point 4) and Neighbors B's concern for Neighbors A's back pain (point 5) might lead to follow-up questions or statements related to health or pets, which aligns well with the casual nature of the dialogue. The only less directly relevant point is Neighbors A exploring the city (point 6), but even this provides a general context of Neighbors A's activities and interests, which can still be useful. Overall, the MEMORY is naturally phrased and contains useful cues to create a continuation of the conversation."
