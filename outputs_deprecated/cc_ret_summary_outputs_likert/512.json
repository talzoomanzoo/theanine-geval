Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. Neighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off. Neighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks? Neighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else. Neighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location? Neighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home. Neighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly.\n2. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n3. Neighbor B reminds Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them.\n4. Neighbor A and Neighbor B discuss organizing a community event to make a positive impact and appreciate the beauty of their city.\n5. Neighbor A started construction on the house last week and plans to finish it in record time.\n6. Neighbors A enjoys taking care of flowers and finds it calming.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some information that could potentially provide context about the interaction between Neighbors A and B, but it is largely unrelated to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT provided. The context focuses on issues related to procrastination and productivity, whereas the MEMORY primarily discusses Neighbor A's skills in construction and their considering of using those skills for good. Only memory line 2 partially connects to the idea of potential (around procrastination), but it's unclear and not directly, this disconnect reduces the overall helpfulness.\n\nSentences in MEMORY are naturally phrased, demonstrating a structure that can tell about Neighbors A and B's past interaction under certain contexts. However, these past interactions involving house-building, skill usage, community events, and flower care do not effectively assist in generating an appropriate response to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about productivity and procrastination. Hence, this earns a rating of 2, as the MEMORY is not structured in a way that assists in creating a next response directly relevant to the conversation about focusing on tasks."
