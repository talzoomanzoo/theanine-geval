Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and B joke about the fun aspects of using telekinesis to surprise people.\n2. Neighbors A is overwhelmed but also excited about their new ability.\n3. Neighbors B is excited and supportive of Neighbors A's new ability.\n4. Neighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation.\n5. Neighbors A has been practicing moving small objects with their telekinesis.\n6. Neighbors A has gained the ability to move objects with their mind.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe memory provides helpful information relevant to the dialogue context, where Neighbor A is asking if Neighbor B can keep a secret. The memory sentences pertaining to Neighbor A's new ability and their feelings about it (sentences 2, 3, 5, and 6) are particularly relevant and establish a past interaction context that can guide the language model in generating a meaningful continuation. These sentences are naturally connected, explaining the development of the telekinesis ability and the reactions of both neighbors. Sentence 1 adds to a shared understanding of how the neighbors humorously perceive this situation. However, sentence 4, related to cooking, seems unrelated to the secret or the new ability and slightly detracts from the overall focus. Despite this, the rest of the memory is structured to provide relevant cues that aid in responding adequately to the dialogue context, warranting a high score on helpfulness."
