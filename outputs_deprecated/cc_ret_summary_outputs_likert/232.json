Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I can't believe how honored I am to be part of our class. I feel like we have something special going on here. Classmates B:  You're right. Our class definitely has a unique energy about it. What do you think sets us apart from other classes? Classmates A:  I think it's our sense of community. We all support each other and work together to achieve our goals. Classmates B:  That's definitely a big factor. And I also think our class has a lot of diversity, which brings new perspectives and ideas to the table. Classmates A:  Yes, absolutely. I love hearing everyone's different viewpoints and experiences. It really helps us all grow and learn. Classmates B:  And it's not just in the classroom, but also in extracurricular activities and events. We always have a strong turnout and participation. Classmates A:  I couldn't agree more. And I feel like being part of our class has made me a better person overall. I've learned so much and grown so much as a result.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B complimented Classmates A on their suit and brought up a past conversation about feelings.\n2. Classmate B feels relieved that they can still be friends with Classmate A.\n3. Classmates B appreciates Classmates A's honesty about their feelings, but doesn't feel the same way.\n4. Classmates A values their friendship with Classmates B and looks forward to wearing a black suit to a wedding reception.\n5. Despite the rejection, Classmate A values their friendship with Classmate B.\n6. Classmate A has been hiding their feelings for Classmate B and finally confesses to being in love with them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I feel the same way. It's amazing to see how much we've all improved and developed together. It's truly a special bond we have in this class.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains information about a personal interaction between Classmates A and B, specifically related to feelings and friendship. However, it lacks direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on a general discussion about the class's sense of community and diversity. The MEMORY entries focus on a rejected romantic interaction and a wedding, which do not offer contextual cues or development relevant to the current dialogue. While it does provide some insight into a previous dynamic between the speakers, this insight does not help generate an appropriate response in the context of the classmates' discussion about their class, making the information largely unhelpful for the task at hand."
