Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work. Wife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help. Husband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff. Wife: Nonsense! You can always come to me with anything. Plus, I enjoy helping you with your creative process. Have you also tried revisiting some of the writing prompts we did in our creative writing class? Husband: I have, but I feel like I'm just repeating the same stories over and over again. Wife: Maybe it's time to take a step back and try something new. Have you ever tried writing in a different genre or experimenting with different styles? Husband: That's a good idea. I guess I just haven't had the courage to step out of my comfort zone. Wife: Remember when you faced your fear of public speaking during your fifth-grade presentation? You can do this too. Sometimes, the biggest breakthroughs come from taking risks. Husband: You're right. Maybe it's time to try something completely different and see where it takes me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The wife reassures the husband that it's okay to be different and encourages him to embrace who he is.\n2. Wife suggests that husband should try using more modern language to be better understood.\n3. The husband is open to learning more about movies, showing a willingness to try again.\n4. Husband agrees to try adapting to modern language for better communication with his wife.\n5. The wife remembers the husband being nervous before the presentation.\n6. The wife compares the situation to when the husband fell asleep during a movie she recommended, indicating past issues in their relationship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY does contain some references that are tangentially related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the wife's recollection of the husband's presentation, which is directly mentioned in the context. However, most of the MEMORY entries do not clearly align with the current conversation's focus on writing and creativity. Sentences 1 and 5 slightly relate to encouragement and overcoming obstacles, which can be seen as helpful in understanding the wife's supportive role. Yet, the rest of the MEMORY entries are either unrelated (such as using modern language or learning about movies) or don't offer a clear development or connection that would enhance the language model's response to the dialogue context. Therefore, the MEMORY lacks coherence and direct relevance in providing helpful information for generating the next response."
