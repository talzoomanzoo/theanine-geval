    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax. Neighbors B: What kind of breathing exercise?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A did this as a gesture of appreciation for Neighbors B's actions in the neighborhood.\n2. Neighbors A is willing to take things slow in their relationship with Neighbors B.\n3. Neighbors A surprised Neighbors B with a pizza.\n4. Neighbor B reassures Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasizes their current friendship.\n5. Neighbors A has developed romantic feelings for Neighbors B.\n6. Neighbor A and Neighbor B found a park together a couple of years ago and enjoyed playing frisbee and having a picnic.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's called the 4-7-8 technique. You inhale for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, and then exhale for 8 seconds. It's been really helpful for me lately.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains several sentences detailing past interactions between Neighbors A and B, such as enjoying a park together and Neighbors A surprising Neighbors B with a pizza. However, these do not provide clear and direct help for generating a response to the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT about a breathing exercise. There is no mention of any past discussions or experiences related to relaxation techniques, breathing exercises, or activities involving relaxation. The sentences are somewhat relevant to understanding a background dynamic between the two neighbors, but they do not provide helpful contextual cues for this specific topic of conversation. Though the sentences are naturally structured and provide context to the relationship's background, they score low on helpfulness for generating a response pertinent to the current dialogue on breathing exercises."
