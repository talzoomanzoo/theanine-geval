Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate B is interested in attending a new technology conference next month.\n2. Classmates B noticed Classmates A's improvement and acknowledged their hard work.\n3. Classmates B recalls a funny moment from high school involving Classmates A wearing pajamas to school.\n4. Classmates A had a moment of frustration in the past but has learned to channel that energy into studies.\n5. Classmates A's grades are looking good according to their teacher.\n6. Classmates A is dedicated to studying hard and taking extra classes to get into a good college.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information about Classmate A's past, but most of them are not directly related to the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about attending an interesting talk. However, MEMORY item 4 could potentially be helpful, as it mentions Classmate A's growth and how they've learned to channel their frustration into their studies. This could be related to the context if the talk Classmate A attended was educational or motivational. Item 6 could also be somewhat relevant, as it reflects Classmate A's dedication to learning, which could tie into attending talks for educational purposes. The sentences are phrased naturally, but there are more unrelated details that don't aid in generating a response directly linked to the current dialogue. Overall, the memory provides some helpful insights but not directly linked to the attending of a talk, resulting in a score of 3."
