Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I just finished my computer course, and I learned so much about using computers effectively.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A has matured since then and learned from past mistakes.\n2. Classmates A acknowledges the mistake and plans to learn from it.\n3. Classmates A and Classmates B are friends who help each other with schoolwork.\n4. Classmates B supported Classmates A through a tough time by listening to them.\n5. Classmates A is considering taking a dance class for fun.\n6. Classmate A appreciates having friends who are there for them during difficult times.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful background information about Classmates A and B's relationship, which could be useful in understanding their interactions. For instance, sentence 3 (\"Classmates A and Classmates B are friends who help each other with schoolwork\") and sentence 4 (\"Classmates B supported Classmates A through a tough time by listening to them\") give context about their supportive friendship. This connection might be relevant if Classmates B were to respond to Classmates A about the computer course. However, many of the sentences are not directly related to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT of Classmates A finishing a computer course. For example, sentences 1, 2, and 5 are unrelated to the context at hand and do not clearly contribute to future dialogue development. The sentences are naturally phrased, but not all are relevant or clearly beneficial for the continuation of the conversation about the computer course. Thus, while there is some utility in the connection details provided, the overall relevancy to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is limited."
