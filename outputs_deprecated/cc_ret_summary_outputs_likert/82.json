Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, have you checked out my new blog? It's all about promoting under-the-radar artists.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A has been pursuing their passions and enjoying life.\n2. Classmates A and B are in the same class and have had previous conversations about study tips.\n3. Classmates B encouraged Classmates A to step out of their comfort zone and try new things for personal growth.\n4. Classmates B supports Classmates A's perspective on living authentically and free from others' opinions.\n5. Classmates B gave advice to Classmates A in the past that paid off.\n6. Classmates A ended up taking Classmates B's advice and found success with it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's awesome! I love that you're using your platform to support talented artists who may not get as much recognition. It's great to see you pursuing your passions and making a positive impact.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant contextual information about Classmates A and B's past interactions. Specifically, it indicates that Classmate B has been supportive and encouraging, which may help in furthering the conversation about Classmate A's new blog centered on under-the-radar artists. Memories like B encouraging A to try new things (3) and supporting A's perspective (4) give insights into their relationship dynamic. The information about success from acting on past advice (5 and 6) connects to Classmate A's initiative with the blog and shows a pattern of taking active, perhaps ambitious steps. However, many of the entries remain somewhat general and do not directly relate to the specific topic of A's new blog. While there's a supportive undertone, the lack of direct connection to promoting arts makes the overall utility of the MEMORY less precise for extending the given dialogue straightforwardly. Hence, a middle-ground score of 3 reflects limited yet somewhat useful past context."
