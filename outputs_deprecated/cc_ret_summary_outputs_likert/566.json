Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you. Classmates B: Oh really?

What kind of project are you thinking about? Classmates A: I was thinking about starting a marketing agency specialized in social media. Classmates B: That's a great idea! I'd love to work with you on that. We could really make a difference in the industry. Classmates A: Yes, exactly! And I think our skills complement each other's so well.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate A and Classmate B both enjoy socializing and going out to parties together.\n2. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n3. Classmate A and Classmate B enjoy singing karaoke together and look forward to future outings.\n4.

    "raw_prediction": "I totally agree! I think we make a great team and this project could be really successful. Let's make it happen!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about the personalities and interests of Classmates A and B, such as their enjoyment of social activities and Classmate B's admiration for Classmate A's outgoing nature. These points can be somewhat helpful in understanding the dynamics between the two classmates and why they might work well together on a social media marketing project due to their sociable and outgoing traits. However, the MEMORY does not contain specific information about their past interactions related to business or project collaboration, and it does not directly link to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences provide some context but do not directly contribute to understanding the current conversation or planning around starting a marketing agency. Thus, while there is some relevant information, it is not comprehensive or directly connected to making the dialogue more coherent or contextually rich in this specific scenario."
