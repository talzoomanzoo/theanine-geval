Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Thank you for finding my glasses for me, Mentor. I always seem to misplace them. Mentor: Not a problem, Mentee. I'm glad I could help.  Mentee: This actually reminds me of when I was struggling with substance abuse. I would often lose things or forget where I put things because of my drinking. It's amazing how much clearer my mind is now that I'm sober.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentee credits Mentor for their help in achieving sobriety and expresses gratitude for the support.\n2. Mentee found getting sober to be a challenging process but is now proud of their progress.\n3. Mentor has been supportive of Mentee's journey to sobriety.\n4. Mentee has a history of substance abuse but has been sober for a year.\n5. Mentor is proud of Mentee for making positive changes and taking control of their life.\n6. Mentee struggled with substance abuse since the age of 15, using it as an escape from problems.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm so happy to hear that, Mentee. It's truly inspiring to see how far you've come on your journey to sobriety. Your progress is something to be proud of.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful and relevant information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 3, and 4 directly relate to the Mentee's past struggles with substance abuse and their current sobriety, which the Mentee mentions in the CONTEXT. Sentence 1 highlights the Mentor's support, which aligns with the Mentee expressing gratitude for finding the glasses and ties into their journey of sobriety. Sentence 2 adds depth by acknowledging the challenging process of sobriety, which is relevant to the Mentee's reflection on their past struggles. Sentence 5 reinforces the Mentor's pride and support toward the Mentee. Sentence 6 gives additional background on the Mentee's substance abuse history, providing context to their current sentiments. Overall, MEMORY is structured naturally and demonstrates the development of the relationship and past interactions between the Mentee and Mentor, making it quite helpful for generating an appropriate next response. However, the connection and phrasing could be slightly more seamless, which is why it does not receive a perfect score."
