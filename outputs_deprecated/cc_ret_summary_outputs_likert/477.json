    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, check out this spot I found to camp out for the night. It's perfect! Classmates B: Wow, this view is amazing! Classmates A: I know, right? And it's completely level and free of any debris. We won't have to worry about rolling off our sleeping pads or anything like that. Classmates B: It definitely looks like a great spot to spend the night. How did you manage to find it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B finds Classmates A's involvement in the community admirable and important.\n2. Classmate A and Classmate B are classmates who attended a party together.\n3. Classmate A expresses a desire to find alternative ways to have fun and make a positive impact in the community.\n4. Classmate B agrees to keep the party a secret in exchange for Classmate A doing their homework for a week.\n5. Classmates B remembers Classmates A's previous involvement in community improvement projects and acknowledges their passion for making a difference.\n6. Classmates A is proactive and curious, taking the initiative to research topics of interest.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information about the previous interactions between Classmates A and B, such as their mutual involvement in community activities and attending a party together. However, these points do not directly relate to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on finding a campsite and appreciating the view. The MEMORY lacks specific details or context that would be helpful for the language model to generate a response in this camping scenario. Thus, while it provides some insight into the relationship between the speakers, it isn't particularly helpful for generating a relevant and contextually appropriate response."
