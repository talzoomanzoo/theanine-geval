Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager!

Co-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products. Co-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader? Co-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago. Co-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality. Co-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes. But it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Remember when I was really stressed about you not liking me?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader.\n2. Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n3. Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\n4.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Co-worker A's aspirations and growth towards becoming a leader, which relates to their recent promotion to product manager. Points 1, 2, 4, and 6 are closely connected to the context of Co-worker B's acknowledgment of Co-worker A's leadership qualities and promotions. The memory is structured in a way that reflects the development in the interactions between the co-workers, like Co-worker B's encouragement and Co-worker A's growth in confidence. Although some repetition exists (e.g., points 2 and 3), the memory still overall supports the context and provides cues for a next response. However, to achieve a score of 5, the memory could have included more specific contextual details and streamlined sentences that offer rich context without repetition."
