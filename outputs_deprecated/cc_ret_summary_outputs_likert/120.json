Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A made a big career change recently and is much happier now.\n2. Neighbors A took the leap to make a change and is glad they did.\n3. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's decision and admires the courage it took.\n4. Neighbors A's husband thinks they are crazy for believing they saw a UFO.\n5. Neighbors A is feeling stagnant in their current job and is looking for more growth and challenge.\n6. Neighbors A believes they saw a UFO in their backyard and still thinks it was real, finding it crazy to think about.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains several sentences that offer potential insight into the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 2, and 3 provide context that Neighbors A recently made a significant career change and is now glad about the decision, which may be related to them becoming a millionaire. Sentence 3 adds that Neighbors B supports this decision, indicating a positive interaction and support from Neighbors B. However, sentences 4 and 6 about a UFO sighting appear to be unrelated to Neighbors A's claim of being a millionaire, providing no relevant context for generating a response in the current dialogue. Sentence 5 indicates some dissatisfaction in a job, which may have led to the career change mentioned earlier. Overall, while there are helpful sentences, there are also irrelevant details, which affects the overall coherence and relevancy of MEMORY to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
