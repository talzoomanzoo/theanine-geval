    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess. Classmates B: Wait, what?

Classmates B: You can't just cheat and hope to never get caught. That's not how it works. Classmates A: Remember when we talked about me wanting to become a professional basketball player? Classmates B: Yeah, I remember. So, what does that have to do with cheating on your taxes?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A has a big dream of becoming a professional basketball player and works hard towards that goal.\n2. Classmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed.\n3. Classmate A is pursuing a dream of becoming a professional basketball player and is working at a grocery store to save up money for training.\n4.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as it elaborates on the background of Classmates A and B's relationship and the support system surrounding Classmate A's basketball aspirations. There is clear development in their interactions, such as Classmate B advising and supporting Classmate A, and their discussions about pursuing a basketball career. This context connects well with the dialogue, where Classmate A shifts from discussing their tax troubles to recalling conversations about their basketball goals. The memory illustrates the supportive role of Classmate B and Classmate A's commitment to hard work. However, the memory lacks specific direct references to the tax issue, which is the main topic in the context, which could make it more explicitly helpful in generating a next response regarding Classmate A's current dilemma. Overall, the memory provides useful context but could be further strengthened with more direct ties to the tax conversation."
