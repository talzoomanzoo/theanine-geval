Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend! Co-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang. Co-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while. Co-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together.\n2. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n3. Co-worker B is married and had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends.\n4. Co-worker A and Co-worker B were able to pay their bills on time when working at the clothing store.\n5. Co-worker A and Co-worker B used to work together at a clothing store.\n6. Co-worker A and Co-worker B are both excited about payday and being able to pay off bills.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains pieces of information that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the shared history of Co-worker A and Co-worker B working together at a clothing store (sentences 4 and 5). However, most of the sentences in the MEMORY don't provide directly useful information to generate a response to Co-worker A's singing. The memory does not offer details relating to Co-worker A's singing ability or interests, nor does it inform about any shared musical interests or related topics. The sentences are somewhat loosely related as they reflect the general relationship between the coworkers, but they lack a clear connection to the current discussion about the singing event. Sentence 6 mentions shared excitement about payday, which is unrelated to the context and does not help in generating the next response. Overall, while the MEMORY provides some context about the relationship's history, it lacks direct helpfulness and logical sequencing in connection to the current conversation about singing."
