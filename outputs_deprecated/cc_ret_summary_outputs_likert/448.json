Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I know you know something about my past. Can you tell me what it is?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A is curious and open to exploring new things and taking risks.\n2. Classmates B warns Classmates A about the potential danger of dark alleys.\n3. Classmates A encountered a mysterious woman in a dark alley, finding her intriguing.\n4. Classmates B advises Classmates A to be careful and aware while on the bus.\n5. Classmates A and B became friends when Classmates A transferred to the school.\n6. Classmates B is open to trying to be more optimistic after the conversation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad you feel comfortable enough to ask me about it. But I think it's important for you to discover and remember on your own. Just know that I'll be here to support you along the way.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could assist in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, the MEMORY indicates that Classmates A is curious and takes risks, which could relate to why they might be asking about something from their past. Additionally, the mysterious woman encounter in a dark alley could be part of the past Classmates A is curious about. The other pieces of information, such as their friendship history and Classmates B's tendency to caution A, offer contextual understanding of their relationship. However, the connection and relevance of these interactions to the specific question posed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT are not entirely clear. The MEMORY could benefit from more direct links to the specific curiosity expressed by Classmates A about their past."
