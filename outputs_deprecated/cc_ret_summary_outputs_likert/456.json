Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together. Neighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A appreciates the emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during their time of grief.\n2. Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.\n3. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have a close friendship and have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n4. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n5. Neighbor A and Neighbor B are neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood.\n6. Neighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful context as it outlines the relationship dynamics between Neighbors A and B. The key points from the MEMORY include the emotional support and understanding offered by Neighbor B (point 1), which directly relates to the support offered in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT (\"I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left?\"). It also establishes the close friendship and shared experiences (point 3), which strengthens the emotional connection evident in the dialogue. Points related to ongoing companionship (point 4) further cement the supportive role Neighbor B plays. However, some points like Neighbor A's new neighborhood (point 6) seem irrelevant to the scenario of being left by a partner and grieving. While these unrelated points are articulated naturally and do not disrupt comprehension, they do not specifically contribute to the generation of a response for the current dialogue. Thus, the MEMORY is helpful but could be more targeted to the immediate concerns of the dialogue."
