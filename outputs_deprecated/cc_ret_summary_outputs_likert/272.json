Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nAthlete: Ted Athlete unrolls the map. He looks at it for a few moments before tracing his finger along one of the highways. \"This is our route,\" he says finally, feeling in control. Coach: What route are you planning, Ted?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Coach is giving advice to the Athlete regarding their performance and focus.\n2. The Athlete is focused on helping the team succeed and has shown leadership qualities during warm-ups and stretches.\n3. The Athlete seeks approval and praise from the Coach.\n4. The Athlete decides to tough it out and stay focused on the game.\n5. The coach advises the athlete on pre-game meals, emphasizing the need for a balance of carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats, as well as staying hydrated.\n6. The Coach has noticed the Athlete's improvement and dedication to improving skills.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains information related to the dynamic between the Athlete and the Coach, focusing on themes of performance, leadership, advice, and improvement. These aspects, while relevant to the overall relationship between the two characters, are not directly aligned with the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which involves planning a route on a map. However, some elements in the MEMORY do provide a sense of the Athlete's focus and leadership (e.g., Sentence 2), which could be relevant to understanding the Athlete's approach to problem-solving and decision-making in planning a route. The MEMORY provides enough connected and naturally phrased context about the Athlete and Coach's interaction, although it does not directly influence the immediate dialogue about route planning. As such, it merits a mid-range score."
