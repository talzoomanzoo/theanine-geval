Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss! Co-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes. Co-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan. Co-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway. Co-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues.\n2. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.\n3. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's competence and effort in their work.\n4. Co-worker A strives to do their best in their work.\n5. Co-worker A is seen as competent and reliable by Co-worker B.\n6. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value communication and understanding in relationships.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate your confidence in your approach, but sometimes it's good to consider different perspectives and find a compromise that works for everyone. Collaboration and open communication are key to a successful team effort.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does provide some helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, especially in showing the positive view Co-worker B has toward Co-worker A's work ethic, competence, and reliability. This can relate to Co-worker A's insistence on doing things their way, as it suggests that their methods are generally effective. Additionally, the MEMORY indicates that both value communication and understanding, which ties into their discussion about finding a balance between Co-worker A's way and other approaches. However, MEMORY lacks a direct connection to the conflict/disagreement presented in the dialogue, particularly Co-worker A's authoritative behavior and Co-worker B's disagreement. Understanding more about past conflicts or specific scenarios where they had to compromise would make the memory more relevant to the current dialogue context. The MEMORY sentences are structured well in general, but some parts could be more directly connected to improve overall relevance and cohesion with the dialogue context."
