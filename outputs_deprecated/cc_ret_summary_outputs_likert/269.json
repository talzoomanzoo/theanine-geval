Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful. Co-workers B: Did you make sure to include all the necessary details? Co-workers A: Yes, I made sure to cover everything we talked about in the meeting. I even added some extra information that I thought could be useful. Co-workers B: That's smart thinking. It shows that you're invested in the company and want to make sure things run smoothly. Co-workers A: Thanks. I learned a lot from taking over the family business. It taught me the importance of being efficient and proactive. Co-workers B: I remember you telling me about that. It's amazing how much you've accomplished since then. Co-workers A: It's been a journey, but I'm glad to see the business flourishing. It gives me a sense of pride and accomplishment. Co-workers B: I can tell. You're always trying to find ways to improve things. Co-workers A: Exactly. That's why I felt a written report would be the best way to communicate the information to my boss. It saves time and ensures everything is organized. Co-workers B: Makes sense. I'm sure your boss will appreciate your efforts.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B appreciates the pen and thanks Co-worker A for the gesture.\n2. Co-worker A has a family business that has been doing well recently.\n3. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a thoughtful gesture.\n4. Co-worker A took over their family's business a few years ago and it has improved since then.\n5. Co-worker B finished a project and sent it to the manager for review.\n6. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a symbol of trust in their professional relationship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Co-worker A having a family business and its recent success, which ties into the dialogue where A discusses learning efficiency and proactiveness from the family business. This connection helps in understanding the background of Co-worker A's work ethic and motivations, which are relevant to the current conversation about written reports and proactive work behavior.\n\nHowever, many sentences in the MEMORY, such as Co-worker B receiving a pen from Co-worker A, do not add meaningful context or development to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These details, while phrased naturally, do not provide contextual cues that progress the current dialogue, which focuses more on Co-worker A's professional growth and actions within the company.\n\nOverall, MEMORY offers some relevant past interaction details but also includes several disconnected or less useful pieces of information, hence a middle-ground score."
