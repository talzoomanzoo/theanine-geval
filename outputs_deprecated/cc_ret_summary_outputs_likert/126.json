    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now! Neighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen? Neighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest. Neighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations! What are you going to do with all that money? Neighbors A: Well, first I'm going to pay off my mortgage and all my debts. After that, I think I'll take a nice long vacation and maybe donate some to charity. Neighbors B: That's very generous of you. Have you thought about investing any of it? Neighbors A: Yes, actually. I've been doing some research and I think I want to invest in some stocks and maybe even start my own business.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A made a big career change recently and is much happier now.\n2. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's decision and admires the courage it took.\n3. Neighbors B has been supportive of Neighbors A's job search, offering to connect them with people in different industries.\n4. Neighbors A took the leap to make a change and is glad they did.\n5. Neighbors A and B had a conversation a couple of years ago about needing a change.\n6. Neighbors A appreciates Neighbors B's understanding and willingness to listen and talk about the experience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a great idea! With your entrepreneurial spirit, I have no doubt you'll be successful. It's inspiring to see you taking charge of your financial future like this.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY primarily focuses on a career change that Neighbors A recently made, with Neighbor B being supportive. However, the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT is centered on Neighbors A becoming a millionaire through an inheritance, discussing paying off debts, potential vacation plans, charity donations, and investments. The MEMORY does not provide relevant contextual information that would assist a language model in generating a next response about financial plans, investments, or charitable actions. Most of the MEMORY content about career changes and support is not directly related to the present topic of discussion, limiting its helpfulness. However, sentences are generally clear and naturally phrased, which is why it avoids a score of 1, but the lack of direct relevancy to the current context keeps it from scoring higher."
