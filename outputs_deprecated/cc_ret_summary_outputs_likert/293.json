Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message. Co-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident. Co-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows. Co-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive. Co-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right. Co-workers B: Speaking of convincing people, have you ever been in a physical altercation before?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A plans to present the evidence clearly and persuasively in court.\n2. Co-worker A has presented evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past.\n3. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument.\n4. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs.\n5. Co-worker A has experience dealing with challenging clients and emphasizes the importance of communication and setting expectations.\n6. Co-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Actually, I try to avoid physical altercations by focusing on communication and setting clear expectations with challenging clients. It's all about finding common ground and resolving conflicts peacefully.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains several sentences that are helpful in generating a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 2, and 6 directly relate to Co-worker A's approach to presenting evidence persuasively, which ties back to the current conversation about public speaking and making compelling arguments. Sentences 3 and 4 also relate to Co-worker A’s persuasive abilities and past experiences, which aligns with Co-worker B's recognition of A’s skills. However, sentence 5, while relevant to Co-worker A’s experience, does not directly connect to the immediate context of public speaking or presenting arguments, but it is phrased in a way that makes it easy to identify its lack of direct relevance. Overall, the MEMORY provides useful context and maintains a natural flow, aiding in understanding the development of the speakers’ past interactions."
