    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today? Co-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there? Co-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done. Co-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded. Co-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out. Co-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends? Co-workers A: Ugh, don't remind me. That was such a disaster.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides.\n2. Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits.\n3. Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides.\n4. Co-worker A has been getting written up for being late to work.\n5. Co-worker A went through a painful breakup and finds it hard to trust people.\n6. Co-worker B is supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains information that provides some context about Co-worker A's past incidents and their relationship with Co-worker B, which can be somewhat helpful in generating a response. The mention of being stranded due to not driving home aligns with past struggles mentioned in MEMORY, such as expensive Uber rides (1) and Co-worker A's efforts to become more responsible (3). Additionally, MEMORY (6) highlights the support from Co-worker B, which could be relevant in extending the dialogue to discuss past mistakes or future plans. However, details regarding Co-worker A's breakup (5) and being written up for tardiness (4) do not directly tie to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT's current topic of the post office visit or being stranded, making them less immediately beneficial. While the MEMORY holds some premise of helpfulness, the connections are not seamlessly articulated, hampering clarity in the development or causality of events as related to the immediate conversation. As such, the contribution is partial but not exhaustive or perfectly structured, leading to a mid-level score."
