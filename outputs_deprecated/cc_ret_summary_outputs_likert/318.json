    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway? Wife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go? Husband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city. Wife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change. Husband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think? Wife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it. Husband: Great. I'll start looking for rental cabins right away. I know this may sound impulsive, but I'm really excited to make this happen. Wife: Don't worry, husband, it's not impulsive. You always follow through with your plans, and I believe this will be a wonderful experience for both of us. Husband: Thank you, wife. And, I want to apologize for the time I left without waiting for you. I know I promised to wait, and I should have kept my word. Wife: It's okay, husband. I understand that you were in a hurry, and it wasn't intentional. Besides, that was a long time ago, and we've moved past it. Husband: Thank you for being so understanding, wife. I just want to make sure I am not repeating the same mistake again.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband apologized and promised to involve the wife in his plans in the future.\n2. The husband acknowledges his mistake, apologizes, and promises to make it up to his wife, emphasizing the importance of keeping promises and taking action.\n3. The husband got impatient and excited about his plans, leading him to leave without the wife.\n4. The wife brings up past disappointment when the husband left without her, breaking a promise to wait for her.\n5. The husband has long-awaited plans and is finally taking action on them.\n6. The husband is excited about his progress on long-awaited plans and is putting in a lot of effort to make them a reality.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe memory provides some helpful information relevant to the dialogue context, but it is not particularly structured in a way that demonstrates the proper development of events. The sentences do capture the husband's excitement and acknowledgement of a past mistake (leaving without his wife), which ties back to the context of planning a getaway. However, some of the sentences are redundant (e.g., multiple mentions of the husband's excitement and effort) and could be phrased in a way that better demonstrates the connection between past interactions and the current conversation about making plans. Additionally, the focus on the husband's actions and feelings, while important, could benefit from a more balanced inclusion of the wife's perspective, given the context's emphasis on mutual decision-making and moving past the previous issue."
