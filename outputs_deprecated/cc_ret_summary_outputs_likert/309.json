Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway? Wife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The wife supports the husband's goals but wanted to be involved in them.\n2. The husband has long-awaited plans and is finally taking action on them.\n3. The husband is inspired by his wife to take action on his dreams and goals.\n4. The husband got impatient and excited about his plans, leading him to leave without the wife.\n5. The wife offers her support and encouragement to the husband in his journey towards achieving his dreams.\n6. The husband apologized and promised to involve the wife in his plans in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information that could be relevant and helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences indicate a relationship dynamic where the wife supports the husband's goals and the husband wants to involve her, which aligns somewhat with the husband's suggestion for a weekend getaway to spend more time together. This past interaction shows that involving the wife in plans is important in their relationship, which can be crucial for Unknown to construct a suitable response for the husband's suggestion.\n\nHowever, there are elements in the MEMORY which are less directly connected to the current context, such as the husband leaving without the wife due to impatience and excitement. While these pieces of memory are phrased naturally, they are less immediately helpful for the specific context of planning a trip together. Overall, the MEMORY moderately supports the context but could be more directly focused on similar activities or topics to increase its helpfulness."
