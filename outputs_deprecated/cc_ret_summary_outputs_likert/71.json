Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on. Child: What is it, Parent? Parent: I created a website where I post advertisements, and people can pay to see them. Child: Oh, that's interesting. How does it work?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Child is caring and offers help to the Parent.\n2. The parent and child have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores.\n3. The Child supports the idea of the Parent adopting more children and hopes for a happy home for them.\n4. The Parent is working and feels tired after a long day.\n5. The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings.\n6. The Child offers to bring water or make soup for the Parent while they are resting.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful context for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it's not perfectly aligned with the specific conversation about the project and website. The MEMORY includes a statement about the Child offering help to the Parent, which can be somewhat relevant when discussing the project, as the Child might be interested in assisting or providing input. Additionally, the memory mentions their open communication about various topics and the Parent's work-related tiredness, which could influence the tone or direction of the conversation. However, much of the MEMORY content focuses on other facets of their relationship (like caregiving and adopting more children) that are not directly relevant to the discussion about the Parent's new project. While these details provide insight into their relationship dynamics, they aren't tightly connected to the immediate topic. Therefore, the MEMORY is moderately helpful but not fully optimized for generating a response specifically pertaining to the project and website discussion."
