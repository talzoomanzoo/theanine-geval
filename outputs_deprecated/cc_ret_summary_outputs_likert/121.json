Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now! Neighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A made a big career change recently and is much happier now.\n2. Neighbors A and B had a conversation a couple of years ago about needing a change.\n3. Neighbors A took the leap to make a change and is glad they did.\n4. Neighbors A appreciates Neighbors B's understanding and willingness to listen and talk about the experience.\n5. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's decision and admires the courage it took.\n6. Neighbors A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I know, it feels surreal! Remember when we talked about needing a change a couple of years ago? I finally took the leap and it paid off big time.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights a significant career change that Neighbors A made, which can be inferred as related to the newfound millionaire status. The MEMORY mentions conversations in the past where a change was needed, which aligns well with the current context of a major life shift. Additionally, the support received from Neighbors B is emphasized, reinforcing their friendly relationship and making it easier for a language model to predict a supportive and congratulatory response from Neighbors B. The details provided in MEMORY are structured naturally and help establish a development from past conversations to the present situation, enhancing the ability to generate an appropriate response. However, some sentences are less directly relevant to the millionaire context but are still beneficial in understanding the relationship between the neighbors."
