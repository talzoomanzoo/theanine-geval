Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately. Classmates B: Why is that? Classmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically. Classmates B: That's a good goal to have. Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra? Classmates A: Definitely. I feel like I'm able to break down problems and analyze them more effectively.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A is always looking to challenge themselves and improve their skills.\n2. Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness.\n3. Classmates A is struggling with feeling competitive and the need to be the best at everything.\n4. Classmates A faced tough competition in middle school from a fast girl, motivating them to improve.\n5. Classmates B is supportive and emphasizes the importance of having someone to talk to about personal matters.\n6. Classmates B emphasizes the importance of enjoying the journey and effort put in, not just focusing on winning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that can be helpful for generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 2 reveal Classmates A's determination and desire to improve, which aligns with their focus on studying algebra. This gives the language model context on Classmates A's motivations and mindset. Sentences 3 and 4 add depth by explaining Classmates A's struggle with competition and past experiences that have motivated them. Sentence 5 highlights the supportive nature of Classmates B, which relates to the encouragement they provide in the dialogue. Sentence 6 adds to the understanding of Classmates B's outlook on goals and self-improvement. The MEMORY as a whole is naturally structured, providing a good understanding of the interaction between Classmates A and B. However, it lacks direct references or connections to the specifics of algebra, so it falls short of a perfect score."
