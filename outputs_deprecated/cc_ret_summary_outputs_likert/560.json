Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n2. Classmates A is social and enjoys meeting new people.\n3. Classmate A and Classmate B enjoy singing karaoke together and look forward to future outings.\n4. Classmate A is outgoing and enjoys meeting new people and making friends.\n5. Classmates A is looking forward to meeting up with Classmates B again after getting better sleep.\n6. Classmate B admires Classmate A's outgoing nature and wants to be more like them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains several statements that provide general insights about Classmates A and B's relationship and individual traits. The sentences do establish a friendly, social, and supportive dynamic between the two, which can be helpful as this aligns with Classmates A's excitement about sharing future plans. However, the MEMORY lacks specific information about their past conversations that could give more direct relevance to the current context of sharing exciting future plans. The only somewhat relevant sentence is the third one, indicating their shared interest in karaoke and looking forward to future outings, suggesting a mutual interest in planning future activities, which can be tied to discussing exciting plans. Overall, while the MEMORY is phrased naturally, it doesn't provide substantial information about past interactions specific to the topic of future plans, which limits its helpfulness to generating a direct response."
