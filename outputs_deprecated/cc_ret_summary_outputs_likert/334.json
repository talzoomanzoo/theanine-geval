Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned? Classmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed. Classmates A: Embarrassed? Why? Classmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier. Classmates A: Come on, tell me! I won't judge you, I promise. Classmates B: Well, I accidentally spilled my lunch all over myself in front of some people. Classmates A: (laughs) That's it? That's why you're embarrassed? I thought it was something serious. Classmates B: (sighs) Yeah, it's silly. But still embarrassing. Classmates A: Don't worry about it. It happens to everyone. Remember the time I tripped and fell in front of the whole class during our presentation? Classmates B: Oh yeah, that was pretty bad. But you handled it so well. You just got up, dusted yourself off, and continued with the presentation. Classmates A: Exactly! That's what you should do too. Own up to it and move on. Don't let it bother you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during the difficult situation.\n2. Classmates B praised Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n3. Classmate B admires Classmate A's attitude and sees it as a good example for others.\n4. Classmates A helped Classmates B out of friendship and believes in supporting each other.\n5. Classmate A believes in doing their best at everything to avoid regrets later.\n6. Classmate B acknowledges Classmate A's success in their career due to their determination and refusal to settle for mediocrity.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You're right. I'll try to remember your attitude and not let this embarrassing moment affect me too much. Thanks for always being so supportive.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided offers some context about the relationship between Classmates A and B, such as expressions of gratitude, admiration, and support. However, the specific events and characteristics mentioned in the MEMORY, like resilience in space, career success, and doing one's best, are not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around a minor embarrassing incident involving spilling lunch. While there are some loose connections such as Classmates A's attitude and support being admired by Classmates B, the MEMORY lacks direct references or instances that are relevant to the context of embarrassment and how to deal with such situations, which is the focus of the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, it only partially assists in generating a next response based on the present interaction."
