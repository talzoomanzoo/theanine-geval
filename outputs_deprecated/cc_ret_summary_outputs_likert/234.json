Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today? Co-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits.\n2. Co-worker A and their ex have both moved on from the breakup.\n3. Co-worker A has been getting written up for being late to work.\n4. Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions.\n5. Co-worker A has been successful in not being late to work for weeks.\n6. Co-worker B is supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some background information regarding the relationship and past interactions between Co-workers A and B, particularly concerning Co-worker A's punctuality and efforts to improve, as well as the supportive nature of Co-worker B. However, this information is not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about a visit to the post office and does not pertain to work habits, responsibility, or personal development. While the MEMORY is structured coherently and offers insight into their dynamic, it does not provide helpful cues related to the specific conversation at hand. Therefore, its relevance and utility in generating a response to the context are limited."
