Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today. Classmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about? Classmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held. Classmates B: Wow, that does sound interesting. Did you take any notes? Classmates A: Yes, I took lots of notes. I'm excited to study this topic more on my own time. Classmates B: That's awesome. It's great to see your enthusiasm for learning. Classmates A: Thanks. I've always been passionate about learning new things. Remember when we talked about how determined I was to get into college? Classmates B: Yeah, I remember. You were always studying and taking extra classes. Classmates A: And now, after all that hard work, I am actually in college. It just goes to show that with dedication, you can achieve your goals. Classmates B: That's so inspiring. It also reminds me of when you wore your pajamas to school. You were always doing something different and unique.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A is dedicated to studying hard and taking extra classes to get into a good college.\n2. Classmates B recalls a funny moment from high school involving Classmates A wearing pajamas to school.\n3. Classmates A struggled with motivation but found a way to stay focused by thinking about the payoff of their hard work.\n4. Classmates B noticed Classmates A's improvement and acknowledged their hard work.\n5. Classmates A is willing to work hard to achieve their dreams.\n6. Classmates A had a moment of frustration in the past but has learned to channel that energy into studies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Haha, I remember that pajama day! It's funny to look back on those moments now. But hey, it's all part of the journey to where I am today. And I'm grateful for your support along the way.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, supporting Classmates A's dedication to studying and achieving their goals. It highlights significant points of their past interactions, such as Classmates A's determination to get into college and how Classmates B acknowledged and noticed their hard work (important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT). Additionally, the memory about wearing pajamas to school is directly referenced in the dialogue, showing its relevance. However, some entries in MEMORY such as Classmates A's struggle with motivation and moment of frustration, while potentially useful background information, are not directly utilized in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, the MEMORY is structured to provide a coherent understanding of the past interactions, making it helpful for generating a proper response in the context, hence earning a score of 4."
