    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind? Classmates A: I know about your affair with that other woman. Classmates B: What are you talking about? I don't have an affair with anyone. Classmates A: Don't lie to me! I saw you together at the restaurant last week.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A has developed a crush on Classmates B, which Classmates B finds flattering.\n2. Classmates A and B have a good relationship, with Classmates A expressing admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor.\n3. Classmates A suggests grabbing lunch together, showing an interest in spending more time with Classmates B.\n4. Both Classmates A and B enjoy talking to each other and consider themselves great study partners.\n5. Both Classmates A and B are open to exploring a romantic connection and are looking forward to getting to know each other better.\n6. Classmates A and B are interested in biology and studying cells.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I think there might be a misunderstanding. I was actually there with my cousin, not another woman.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful background information about the relationship between Classmates A and B, such as their mutual admiration, good relationship, and shared interests in biology. This context can be beneficial for generating a response in a dialogue where the nature of their relationship is questioned, potentially providing nuances on why Classmates A might be upset. However, the MEMORY lacks direct connections to the specific situation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the accusation of an affair. While it identifies a developing romantic interest, which might be relevant, it does not provide insights into the alleged affair or previous interactions that could clarify the current conflict. The sentences are well-structured and provide a cohesive narrative of their general relationship, but don't directly pertain to the situation at hand, limiting its helpfulness."
