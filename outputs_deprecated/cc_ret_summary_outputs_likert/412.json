Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A is always looking to challenge themselves and improve their skills.\n2. Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness.\n3. Classmates A is struggling with feeling competitive and the need to be the best at everything.\n4. Classmates A faced tough competition in middle school from a fast girl, motivating them to improve.\n5. Classmates B is supportive and emphasizes the importance of having someone to talk to about personal matters.\n6. Classmate A and Classmate B are classmates.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides a moderate level of helpfulness in generating a response to the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Some sentences in the MEMORY are relevant as they reflect Classmate A's focus on self-improvement, competitiveness, and ambition, which align with their current focus on studying algebra. For example, sentences 1, 2, and 4 are relevant because they provide context about Classmate A's determination and previous motivations, potentially influencing their current study behavior. Sentence 3 also hints at Classmate A's struggle with competition, which could be relevant when discussing their study habits or motivations.\n\nHowever, other sentences like 5 and 6 are less directly relevant to the specific topic of studying algebra, although they do offer some background on the relationship and interactions between Classmate A and B. The sentences in the MEMORY are naturally phrased, but the development and connectivity with the specific focus on studying algebra could be more clearly demonstrated. Overall, the MEMORY provides useful information but falls short of fully aligning with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT in a way that would warrant a higher score."
