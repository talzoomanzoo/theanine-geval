Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together. Neighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left? Neighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him. Neighbors B: That's not true, Neighbor A. You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are. Neighbors A: I just feel so lost right now. I don't know how to move on from this. Neighbors B: It's going to take time, but you will get through this. Do you want to talk about how you're feeling or do something to take your mind off of things? Neighbors A: Maybe both? I just feel so overwhelmed and I don't know what to do. Neighbors B: How about we go for a walk and you can talk to me about everything that's been on your mind?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A appreciates the emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during their time of grief.\n2. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n3. Neighbor A finds solace in nature and believes that it helps in coping with their emotions.\n4. Neighbors A and Neighbors B enjoy going for walks together, especially to the park.\n5. Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.\n6. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have a close friendship and have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a good idea. I really appreciate you being here for me, Neighbor B. Let's head to the park and talk. Thank you for always being such a good friend.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information that effectively captures the sentiment and interaction between Neighbor A and Neighbor B in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 2 accurately reflect the support and understanding that Neighbor B is providing to Neighbor A. This information is directly relevant to the current dialogue where Neighbor A is seeking emotional support due to feeling lost after a relationship ended. Sentences 4 and 6 also indicate that walks, especially in the park, are activities that both neighbors enjoy, aligning well with Neighbor B's suggestion to go for a walk in the context. These details create a clear picture of their close friendship and shared coping mechanisms. However, sentences 3 and 5 introduce elements (solace in nature and grandmother loss) that are not directly linked to the current dialogue about the breakup and may create some ambiguity. While they are naturally phrased, they do not directly connect to the present context, slightly lowering the overall relevance. However, the memory is still highly beneficial in understanding Neighbor A and B's relationship, thus warranting a score of 4."
