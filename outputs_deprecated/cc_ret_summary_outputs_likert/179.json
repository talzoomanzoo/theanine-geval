    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband enjoys being outside and loves the weather after being stuck indoors at work.\n2. The husband's faith has been strong lately, and he is involved in various church ministries.\n3. The husband feels happy and content being outside in the beautiful weather.\n4. The husband had a good time hanging out with his friend and feels refreshed and trusted around him.\n5. The husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that make him happy outside of work and family life.\n6. The wife is glad to see the husband finding a sense of purpose and being happy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful context regarding the husband's interests and sense of happiness derived from outdoor activities and support from his wife. This can be connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where the husband mentions hanging up lights and candles, suggesting that he enjoys activities involving decoration or enhancing his surroundings, which could be outdoors. However, the MEMORY entries about church ministries, his friendship, and trust could be disconnected from the current dialogue, as they don't directly relate to the hanging of lights and candles. Overall, the MEMORY provides a partial insight into the husband's character and interests relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, though not all entries are directly beneficial."
