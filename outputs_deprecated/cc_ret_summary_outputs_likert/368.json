Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: It's great to have friends who can help each other out, isn't it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the suggestion.\n2. Neighbors A bought a necklace from Neighbors B's shop and loves it.\n3. Neighbors B offered to help Neighbors A with the apology process.\n4. Neighbors A was looking for a new necklace and stumbled upon Neighbors B's shop.\n5. Neighbors A struggled with apologizing and admitting when they are wrong.\n6. Both neighbors express the difficulty of not being able to adopt all the animals they see but appreciate those who do adopt and give them loving homes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several sentences that provide helpful information regarding past interactions between Neighbors A and Neighbors B, which could prove beneficial for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 1 shows gratitude from Neighbors A, suggesting a friendly relationship, which aligns with the context of helping each other out. Sentences 2 and 4 indicate a past transaction and relationship-building experience via Neighbors B's shop, creating more connection between the two. Sentence 3 especially aligns with the context as it directly showcases a scenario where the neighbors help each other out, highly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 5 highlights a personal struggle of Neighbors A, providing depth to their character, though it does not directly connect to \"helping each other out.\" Sentence 6 is not directly related but shows shared values, hinting at common ground between the neighbors. Overall, the sentences are structured naturally and demonstrate the development of the relationship between the neighbors, making them helpful for generating a relevant next response."
