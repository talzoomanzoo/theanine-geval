    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess. Classmates B: Wait, what? You cheated on your taxes? That's not okay. Classmates A: I know, I know. I was just really struggling financially and I thought I could get away with it. Classmates B: You can't just cheat and hope to never get caught. That's not how it works. Classmates A: Remember when we talked about me wanting to become a professional basketball player?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A has a big dream of becoming a professional basketball player and works hard towards that goal.\n2. Classmate A is pursuing a dream of becoming a professional basketball player and is working at a grocery store to save up money for training.\n3. Classmates A believes in hard work and dedication to achieve goals both in basketball and their job.\n4. Classmate B brought goods to Classmate A's house and is supportive of their basketball dream.\n5. Classmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed.\n6. Classmates A sometimes doubts if they are good enough to make it to the professional level.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, I remember. You have a big dream and you're working hard towards it. Don't let this setback discourage you. Stay focused on your goal, believe in yourself, and keep pushing forward. Just like in basketball, you can overcome challenges with hard work and dedication.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that is closely related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. In the dialogue, Classmates A mentions their dream of becoming a professional basketball player, which is a key element of the MEMORY. Sentences 1 and 2 confirm and expand on this goal by mentioning Classmate A's dedication and their part-time job to support their training. Sentence 5 directly ties into the conversation as Classmates B advises A to stay focused and seek help, reflecting B's supportive nature shown in the dialogue. Additionally, Sentence 6 adds dimension to Classmates A's character by expressing their doubts, which could inform future dialogue and encourage empathy or support from Classmates B. The sentences are well-structured and provide a coherent backstory that complements the dialogue, making the MEMORY helpful for generating a proper next response. However, not every sentence directly influences the current situation, thus not reaching a perfect score."
