Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B finished a project and sent it to the manager for review.\n2. Co-worker B appreciates the pen and thanks Co-worker A for the gesture.\n3. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a thoughtful gesture.\n4. Co-worker A believes the project will be approved with flying colors.\n5. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a symbol of trust in their professional relationship.\n6. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen that they still use.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided does have some connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, especially surrounding the theme of giving and trust, such as Co-worker A's gesture of giving a pen as a symbol of trust. However, the MEMORY lacks clear relevance to the primary focus of the context, which involves the hopes concerning a report given to a boss. The MEMORY mainly centers around interactions involving a pen giveaway, which does not significantly contribute to generating the next response related to the discussion about the report and its appraisal by the boss. As a result, while the individual sentences are somewhat connected and naturally structured, they do not effectively facilitate the generation of an appropriate response focused on the current dialogue context. The information within the MEMORY could be worded in a manner more related to their past interactions regarding professional work submissions, which would help boost the score."
