    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing! Neighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go? Neighbors A: I visited Brazil and Peru. The culture and food were incredible. Neighbors B: That sounds awesome. I've always wanted to go to Peru to see Machu Picchu. Neighbors A: Yes, Machu Picchu is amazing. The view from the top is breathtaking.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and B believe in doing nice things for others to bring the community together.\n2. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's organization skills and wishes to improve their own organization.\n3. Both Neighbors A and B believe in the importance of learning and self-improvement.\n4. Neighbors A and B both took a cooking class together last year.\n5. Neighbors B remembers the incident.\n6. Neighbors A is very organized in their room and house and never wastes time searching for things.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I remember when we took that cooking class together last year. It was so much fun. Maybe we should plan another activity like that soon. Your organization skills always amaze me, maybe I can learn a thing or two from you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not directly relate to most of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is primarily focused on a recent trip to South America, specifically experiences in Brazil and Peru. The MEMORY includes some potentially useful information about the neighbors' shared community values and activities, such as taking a cooking class together. However, these details do not immediately connect with or enhance the specific travel-related dialogue occurring between them. Essentially, the MEMORY lacks direct relevance to the current conversation about travel experiences, and thus only offers limited contextual cues for generating a continuation of the dialogue about South America. The sentences, while naturally phrased, do not establish a clear development or causality related to the travel topic, resulting in a low helpfulness score."
