Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends. Mentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n2. The Mentee has been offered a job and has decided to take the job in the city.\n3. The Mentor is supportive and praises the Mentee for their mature decision-making process.\n4. The Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process.\n5. Mentee agreed to go back to the store to make things right and expressed gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n6. Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you for reminding me of that, Mentor. I'll try to keep an open mind and see this as a chance to grow and make new friends. Your support means a lot to me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information regarding the mentee's current situation of starting life in a new city, as shown in points 1, 2, 3, and 4. These points reveal the mentor's supportiveness and instances of the mentee seeking and receiving guidance. This is useful for the language model to understand the mentor-mentee relationship and how they interact. However, points 5 and 6 introduce unrelated events about a store incident and college applications, which are not connected to the current feeling of loneliness expressed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While these sentences are naturally phrased, they still divert from the current conversation's immediate focus and do not significantly aid in generating an appropriate next response. Therefore, it is moderately beneficial but could be more focused on the feelings of loneliness and how the mentor has previously helped the mentee with similar emotional challenges."
