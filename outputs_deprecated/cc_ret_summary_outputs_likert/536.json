Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind? Classmates A: I know about your affair with that other woman. Classmates B: What are you talking about? I don't have an affair with anyone. Classmates A: Don't lie to me! I saw you together at the restaurant last week. Classmates B: That was just a business meeting. We were discussing a potential collaboration on a music project.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A has developed a crush on Classmates B, which Classmates B finds flattering.\n2. Classmates A and B have a good relationship, with Classmates A expressing admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor.\n3. Classmates A suggests grabbing lunch together, showing an interest in spending more time with Classmates B.\n4. Both Classmates A and B enjoy talking to each other and consider themselves great study partners.\n5. Both Classmates A and B are open to exploring a romantic connection and are looking forward to getting to know each other better.\n6. Classmates A and B are interested in biology and studying cells.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "To evaluate the MEMORY in relation to how helpful it is for generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT provided, let's review the content of both.\n\nIn the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, the main topic revolves around a tense confrontation where Classmates A accuses Classmates B of having an affair, and Classmates B denies it, claiming it was a business meeting regarding a music project.\n\nNow, let's examine the MEMORY:\n\n1. **Crush and Flattery**: Classmates A has a crush on Classmates B, which B finds flattering. This information might provide a basis for why Classmates A might be more sensitive or observant about Classmates B's interactions with others.\n   \n2. **Good Relationship**: They share a good relationship, with Classmates A admiring Classmates B. This background could inform Classmates A's emotional stake in the accusation.\n\n3. **Interest in Spending Time**: Classmates A's interest in spending more time with Classmates B speaks to their desire to deepen the relationship, possibly underlining their jealousy or concern.\n   \n4. **Great Study Partners**: Their shared enjoyment of each other's company as study partners establishes a foundation of mutual respect and communication, which could be emotionally complicated by the accusation.\n\n5. **Exploring Romantic Connection**: Both classmates are open to a romantic connection. This insight directly ties into how the current misunderstanding could jeopardize potential romantic developments.\n\n6. **Interest in Biology and Studying Cells**: Mutual interest in biology isn't directly relevant to the accusation but shows shared interests which form the bond between them.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides a reasonably detailed view of the relationship dynamics between Classmates A and B. While not every detail in MEMORY directly pertains to the affair accusation, aspects like the ongoing romantic interest and admiration do contextually enhance the understanding of Classmates A's emotional response and possible motivations. \n\nThere is some relevancy and development of their inter-personal interactions which sets a foundation that is relevant to the context of the accusation.\n\nHelpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY does offer information that sheds light on the dynamics and potential underlying emotions between the two characters, but it lacks specific detail directly about the event or how their relationship was impacted previously by such claims or events, which would be helpful for generating a more immediate and precise response in line with the context."
