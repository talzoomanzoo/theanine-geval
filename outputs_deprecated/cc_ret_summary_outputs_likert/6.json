Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life. Child: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you. Parent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you. Child: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you? Parent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference. Child: I'm glad you found someone to talk to. You know, I remember when we watched the sunrise together a few weeks ago. That was really special. Parent: It was. I love being able to appreciate the beauty of nature. And you know, having my own place to live in the suburbs makes it even easier to do things like that.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The child recalls a memorable morning watching the sunrise with the parent.\n3. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n4. The child is supportive and caring towards the parent.\n5. The child is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes.\n6. The Parent eventually got to see the sunrise after leaving detention.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences in MEMORY clearly capture the essence of the conversation between the parent and child. Sentence 1 reflects the parent's resilience and hope, which aligns with the discussion on listening and feeling heard. Sentence 2 directly connects to the child's recollection of watching the sunrise, which is an important part of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 6 also links to the dialogue by mentioning the parent seeing the sunrise after detention. Sentences 3, 4, and 5, while not directly mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, are naturally phrased and capture the supportive and positive relationship between the parent and child, which is evident in the context. The MEMORY is well-structured and provides a clear development of the interactions, making it easy for the language model to generate a suitable response. However, it could be improved with more direct references to specific conversation points, such as the details of the parent's past experiences in detention or more on the significance of appreciating nature, to achieve a perfect score."
