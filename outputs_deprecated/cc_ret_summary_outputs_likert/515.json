Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. Neighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off. Neighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks? Neighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else. Neighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location? Neighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home. Neighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become. Neighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice. Neighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along?  Neighbors A: It's finished! Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. It was a lot of work, but worth it in the end. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly.\n2. Neighbor B reminds Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them.\n3. Neighbors A helped Neighbors B build a new house with amazing features.\n4. Neighbor B is looking forward to seeing the finished house and is excited about the new project.\n5. Neighbors A found building the new house challenging but rewarding.\n6. Neighbor A started construction on the house last week and plans to finish it in record time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's amazing to hear! I can't wait to see the finished result, I'm sure it's going to be incredible. You always do such a fantastic job with your projects.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe memory provides some helpful context concerning Neighbor A and Neighbor B's interactions, particularly pertaining to their efforts and interest in building houses. This is relevant to the conversation in the Dialogue Context where Neighbor A mentions that their house project is finished. It provides a backstory to the shared activity and experience in house building mentioned by Neighbor A in the dialogue context. However, the sentences in the memory could be more naturally interconnected and detailed, as they tend to focus more broadly on projects rather than directly connecting to the current situation of project deadlines and procrastination discussed primarily in the dialogue context. The memories give a sense of continuity but lack direct ties to the conversation on time management and procrastination strategies."
