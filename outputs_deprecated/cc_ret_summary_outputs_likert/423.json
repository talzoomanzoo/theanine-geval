Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately. Classmates B: Why is that? Classmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically. Classmates B: That's a good goal to have. Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra? Classmates A: Definitely. I feel like I'm able to break down problems and analyze them more effectively. Classmates B: It's always rewarding when hard work pays off. Classmates A: Yes it is. It reminds me of when I proved my brother wrong in that race. I was so determined to win and it paid off in the end. Classmates B: It's great to see that determination and hard work lead to success in different areas of life. Classmates A: And even when I felt that pain in my arm, I waited and it eventually went away. Classmates B: It's important to listen to your body and take care of yourself. Classmates A: Exactly. And sometimes, it's nice to just take a break and enjoy a quiet moment to yourself. Classmates B: Like when you were admiring the patterns in the ceiling?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B emphasizes the importance of enjoying the journey and effort put in, not just focusing on winning.\n2. Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness.\n3. Classmates A is always looking to challenge themselves and improve their skills.\n4. Classmates A is struggling with feeling competitive and the need to be the best at everything.\n5. Classmates A faced tough competition in middle school from a fast girl, motivating them to improve.\n6. Classmates B brings up a past event where Classmates A beat their brother in a race, highlighting their competitive nature.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relatively helpful information for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Most of the sentences are clearly structured and relevant to the dialogue, such as statements about Classmate A's determination, competitiveness, and experiences in middle school. These provide contextual insights into Classmate A's character and motivations, which are crucial for forming responses aligned with their development and interaction in the conversation. However, some sentences in the MEMORY could be more directly connected to the dialogue context (e.g., the generalized focus on competitiveness and self-improvement), affecting the perfect coherence assessment. The MEMORY still contains naturally phrased sentences that aid in understanding Classmate A and B's dynamic, warranting a high but not perfect score."
