Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately. Classmates B: Why is that? Classmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically. Classmates B: That's a good goal to have. Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra? Classmates A: Definitely. I feel like I'm able to break down problems and analyze them more effectively. Classmates B: It's always rewarding when hard work pays off.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A is always looking to challenge themselves and improve their skills.\n2. Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness.\n3. Classmates A faced tough competition in middle school from a fast girl, motivating them to improve.\n4. Classmates A is struggling with feeling competitive and the need to be the best at everything.\n5. Classmates B emphasizes the importance of enjoying the journey and effort put in, not just focusing on winning.\n6. Classmates B is supportive and emphasizes the importance of having someone to talk to about personal matters.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating a response in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The statements demonstrate the development and relational dynamics between Classmates A and B. Notably, Classmates A's desire to challenge themselves and improve (sentence 1) and Classmates B's recognition of this (sentence 2) are directly relevant to the current conversation about studying algebra for personal growth. The memory also captures the supportive nature of Classmates B (sentence 6), which is consistent with the encouraging tone in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the concept of enjoying the journey rather than solely focusing on goals (sentence 5) aligns with the ongoing theme of improvement and personal growth in their dialogue. Some details, like middle school experiences (sentence 3) and struggles with competitiveness (sentence 4), although not directly referenced in the context, are naturally connected and structured, which makes it easy for the model to understand the broader conversation context. These aspects make the MEMORY beneficial for understanding the interpersonal dynamics and motivations of the speakers, contributing to generating a suitable response."
