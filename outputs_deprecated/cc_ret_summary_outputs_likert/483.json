Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as evidenced by their conversation about their respective experiences.\n2. Classmates A and B are both keeping up with the homework in their math class.\n3. Classmates A enjoys reminiscing about childhood memories, particularly about playing on swings and making music with friends.\n4. Classmates A plays the guitar, takes lessons, and plays in a band.\n5. Classmates B finds it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after a conversation they had about following dreams.\n6. Classmates A and B are discussing beverage choices, with A considering between Coke and Sprite.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY includes some relevant and helpful information regarding the relationship and dynamics between Classmates A and B, such as their supportive relationship (#1) and common activities (#2). These details can be helpful for generating a response that captures the friendly and supportive interaction between the two. However, other parts of the MEMORY like #3, #4, and #6 - while they provide background, may not directly aid in formulating a response to \"How are you feeling today?\" as they are more about past activities and preferences not tied to current emotions or state. Thus, while MEMORY is somewhat informative and relevant, it could be more consistently helpful by focusing on emotional or contextual information more directly related to the current conversation."
