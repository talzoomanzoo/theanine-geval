    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned? Classmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed. Classmates A: Embarrassed? Why?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during the difficult situation.\n2. Classmates A is stranded in space, running out of oxygen and feeling lightheaded.\n3. Classmate B admires Classmate A's attitude and sees it as a good example for others.\n4. Classmates B praised Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n5. Classmates A helped Classmates B out of friendship and believes in supporting each other.\n6. Classmate B acknowledges Classmate A's success in their career due to their determination and refusal to settle for mediocrity.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I was just reflecting on our conversation earlier about your resilience and determination in space. It made me realize how much I admire your strength and how it motivates me to be better.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provided does not contain information that directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Classmates A is inquiring about why Classmates B's face is red and splotchy, with Classmates B expressing embarrassment. The MEMORY entries focus on past interactions that involve support, admiration, and resilience but do not connect to the current context of embarrassment. Therefore, these memories do not give helpful insights for generating a relevant response to the ongoing conversation between Classmates A and B about the reddened face and feelings of embarrassment. The structure of the MEMORY does not offer a clear development of events that could enhance the understanding or relevancy to the current dialogue, thus hindering Unknown's ability to generate a proper next response."
