    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn. Teacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation? Student: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle. Teacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time? Student: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The teacher and student have a positive and understanding relationship.\n2. The student mentioned feeling stressed lately, which may have led to the outburst.\n3. The teacher expressed understanding and encouraged the student to seek help when needed.\n4. The student felt rewarded by the experience and emphasized the importance of being aware of surroundings and acting quickly in emergencies.\n5. The teacher advises the student on effective communication and problem-solving, emphasizing the importance of talking calmly and finding solutions together.\n6. The student apologizes to the teacher for yelling in the hallway, acknowledging it was out of character and seeking to move past it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It could be a fun challenge to gradually increase your tolerance. Just make sure to listen to your body and stop if it becomes too much. Remember, moderation is key!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not contain any directly relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around a conversation about spicy food and building tolerance, while the MEMORY mostly includes information related to stress, apologies, effective communication, and emergency awareness. While it suggests a positive relationship between the teacher and the student, it does not give details or connections that would assist in generating a relevant next response based on the current topic of spicy food and tolerance. Overall, the sentences don't demonstrate a clear development or causality that links to the hot sauce discussion and instead focus on different scenarios."
