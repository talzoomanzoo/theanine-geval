Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A is grateful for life experiences and is open to new possibilities in the future.\n2. Co-worker A has grown as a person and as an artist, learning about empathy and compassion.\n3. Co-worker A felt remorse for what they did and appreciated Co-worker B's understanding.\n4. Co-worker B emphasized the importance of learning from mistakes and working together as a team.\n5. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.\n6. Co-worker A is creative and talented in making jewelry.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad to hear that you feel supported by our boss. It really makes a difference in the work environment, doesn't it?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains some information that could be relevant to generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 3, and 5 align with the supportive theme, implying the positive and collaborative nature of Co-worker A and B's relationship, which has potential connections or causality related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about having a supportive boss.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY does not mention the boss explicitly and mostly focuses on personal growth, collaboration, and creativity without directly linking to the specific context of being grateful for a boss's support. Additionally, sentence 6 about jewelry-making seems out of place, as it does not contribute much to understanding the professional relationship or support mentioned. Overall, while there is some helpful information, a clearer and more direct connection to the dialogue context would make the memory more beneficial."
