Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today? Co-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there? Co-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done. Co-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded. Co-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out. Co-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends? Co-workers A: Ugh, don't remind me. That was such a disaster. Co-workers B: It was definitely not one of your finest moments. But it's good to see that you're being responsible now and taking care of things like sending packages. Co-workers A: Thanks. I'm trying to be more responsible and reliable these days.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides.\n2. Co-worker B is supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable.\n3. Co-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides.\n4. Co-worker A is trying to improve their punctuality and cut back on drinking.\n5. Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits.\n6. Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY is largely relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as it provides background information on past interactions and ongoing behaviors of Co-worker A that are relevant to the conversation. The context revolves around Co-worker A's efforts to be more responsible, referencing a past incident involving a night out and transportation issues, which aligns well with memory points 1-5. These points offer a detailed understanding of Co-worker A's personal growth and Co-worker B's supportive stance, thus providing valuable cues for generating appropriate dialogue responses. Memory point 6, although slightly tangential, still relates to Co-worker B's role in advising Co-worker A, adding depth to the interaction. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured, with natural sentences showing the development of themes present in the dialogue."
