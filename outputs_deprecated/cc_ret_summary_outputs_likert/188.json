Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today. Wife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that. Husband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you. Wife: You always go above and beyond, dear. Husband: It's the little things that count, right? Wife: Definitely. Speaking of little things, do you remember when you told me about catching the bus just in time a few months ago? Husband: Oh yes, I remember. I was so relieved I didn't have to wait in the cold for the next one. Wife: It's amazing how small moments like that can make such a big difference in our day, isn't it? Husband: Absolutely. It's the small moments that make life worth living. Wife: And speaking of living, you mentioned a while back how involved you are in the different ministries at church.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful.\n2. The husband appreciates the little things in life, such as making it to the bus on time.\n3.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 2 capture the theme of appreciating the small things in life, which is discussed explicitly in the dialogue regarding the hanging of lights and the bus incident. Sentence 5 ties into the wife's mention of the husband's involvement in church ministries, providing relevant background information about his faith and activities, which naturally connects to the dialogue's development. Sentences 3 and 4 extend the context by giving insight into the husband's appreciation for the support of his wife, which can be inferred from the dialogue's warm and supportive tone. Sentence 6 concludes with the wife's satisfaction in the husband's pursuit of happiness, subtly matching the nurturing vibe of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, the MEMORY is structured naturally and beneficially, supporting various elements of the dialogue and providing a clear depiction of the couple's interactions and sentiments."
