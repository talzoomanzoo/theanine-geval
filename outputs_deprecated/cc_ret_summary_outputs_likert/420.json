Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately. Classmates B: Why is that? Classmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically. Classmates B: That's a good goal to have. Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra? Classmates A: Definitely. I feel like I'm able to break down problems and analyze them more effectively. Classmates B: It's always rewarding when hard work pays off. Classmates A: Yes it is. It reminds me of when I proved my brother wrong in that race. I was so determined to win and it paid off in the end. Classmates B: It's great to see that determination and hard work lead to success in different areas of life. Classmates A: And even when I felt that pain in my arm, I waited and it eventually went away.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness.\n2. Classmates B emphasizes the importance of enjoying the journey and effort put in, not just focusing on winning.\n3. Classmates A faced tough competition in middle school from a fast girl, motivating them to improve.\n4. Classmates A is always looking to challenge themselves and improve their skills.\n5. Classmates A is struggling with feeling competitive and the need to be the best at everything.\n6. Classmates B brings up a past event where Classmates A beat their brother in a race, highlighting their competitive nature.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe memory provides helpful information for generating a response based on the dialogue context. It acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness, which is consistent with the context where Classmates A discusses working hard to succeed in studying algebra and in a race with their brother. The memory also highlights Classmates A's tendency to challenge themselves, which aligns with their approach to studying algebra for logical and critical thinking improvement. Furthermore, the memory contains information about Classmates B emphasizing the importance of enjoying the journey, which can be relevant and supportive in extending the current conversation naturally. However, there are some elements in the memory that don't directly connect to the present dialogue context, such as Classmates A feeling competitive in middle school, which is why it's not a perfect 5. But overall, the memory provides a detailed and relevant background that enhances the language model's ability to maintain a coherent and contextually appropriate conversation."
