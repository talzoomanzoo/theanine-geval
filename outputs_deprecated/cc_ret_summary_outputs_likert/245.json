Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today? Co-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there? Co-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done. Co-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded. Co-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out. Co-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends? Co-workers A: Ugh, don't remind me. That was such a disaster. Co-workers B: It was definitely not one of your finest moments. But it's good to see that you're being responsible now and taking care of things like sending packages. Co-workers A: Thanks. I'm trying to be more responsible and reliable these days. Co-workers B: That's great to hear. It reminds me of the time when you were a great leader in your country. You were strong, determined, and made a positive impact. Co-workers A: Wow, that was a long time ago. But I appreciate the compliment. It's nice to be reminded of my successes. Co-workers B: Yeah, and even though you had some rough times in your personal life, like that painful breakup, you still managed to pick yourself up and move forward. Co-workers A: It wasn't easy, but I had to. And now I try to focus on the positive things in life, like sending packages without any issues.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B is supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable.\n2. Co-worker A was a leader in their country, making it prosperous and safe.\n3. Both co-workers show a supportive and caring attitude towards each other.\n4. Co-worker A believes their success as a leader was due to determination and strength of character.\n5. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to give people a chance.\n6.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains several elements that contribute to the helpfulness in generating a next response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory clearly identifies Co-worker B's supportive nature towards Co-worker A's efforts to be more responsible (MEMORY 1), which aligns with the context where Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's sense of responsibility in sending packages and overcoming past mistakes (DIALOGUE CONTEXT). MEMORY 2 and 4 connect with the dialogue mentioning Co-worker A's past leadership qualities. MEMORY 3 accurately reflects the positive and supportive interaction between the co-workers seen in the dialogue. While MEMORY 5 mentions Co-worker B's support in encouraging Co-worker A to give people a chance, which is not as clearly evident from the context, it is still phrased naturally. MEMORY 6 corroborates Co-worker A's attempt to be more responsible, linking back to past experiences mentioned in the dialogue. Overall, the MEMORY is helpful in portraying the past interactions and the bond between the co-workers, although a few of the elements could be more directly related to the specific context provided."
