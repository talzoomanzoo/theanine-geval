Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, have you checked out my new blog? It's all about promoting under-the-radar artists. Classmates B: I haven't had a chance to yet, but that sounds really cool! What inspired you to start it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A has been pursuing their passions and enjoying life.\n2. Classmates A and B are in the same class and have had previous conversations about study tips.\n3. Classmates A ended up taking Classmates B's advice and found success with it.\n4. Classmates B encouraged Classmates A to step out of their comfort zone and try new things for personal growth.\n5. Classmates B supports Classmates A's perspective on living authentically and free from others' opinions.\n6. Classmates A was initially hesitant about following Classmates B's advice.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Well, I remember our conversation about stepping out of my comfort zone and trying new things for personal growth. Your encouragement really pushed me to pursue my passion for supporting under-the-radar artists.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context regarding the relationship and interactions between Classmates A and B, which could be potentially relevant for generating a response to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory indicates that Classmates A has been pursuing their passions and succeeded by following Classmates B's advice, and there is a mutual support dynamic. However, the MEMORY lacks direct information about the specific topic of the blog about under-the-radar artists which is the primary subject of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the MEMORY outlines a supportive and encouraging relationship, it doesn't give overly specific interactions related to the blog, nor does it contain causality or direct relevance to the current conversation topic, thus slightly limiting its helpfulness. Nevertheless, the information is presented in a structured manner and contributes to the understanding of the characters' past dynamic."
