Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going? Neighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you? Neighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A looks forward to playing with Neighbors B again when feeling better.\n2. Neighbors A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbors B.\n3. Neighbors A and Neighbors B enjoy playing together with toys.\n4. Neighbors B is familiar with Neighbors A's dog and looking forward to playing with it again.\n5. Neighbors A is enjoying the different culture and exploring the city.\n6. Neighbors B expresses concern for Neighbors A's back pain.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \n\nMEMORY contains some information that might be relevant for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as statements about Neighbors A appreciating Neighbors B's support and friendship (sentence 2), which aligns with the friendly nature of the conversation. However, most sentences in MEMORY do not directly connect with the current topic of discussion, which is reminiscing about the rock band. For example, statements about playing with toys (sentence 3) or Neighbors A exploring the city (sentence 5) do not provide helpful context for generating a response related to a rock band. Additionally, the connections between the sentences in MEMORY do not clearly indicate a coherent development of past interactions that relate well to the given dialogue context. Thus, MEMORY has limited helpfulness for generating an appropriate next response."
