Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I can't believe how honored I am to be part of our class. I feel like we have something special going on here. Classmates B:  You're right. Our class definitely has a unique energy about it. What do you think sets us apart from other classes?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B complimented Classmates A on their suit and brought up a past conversation about feelings.\n2. Classmates B appreciates Classmates A's honesty about their feelings, but doesn't feel the same way.\n3. Classmate B feels relieved that they can still be friends with Classmate A.\n4. Classmates A values their friendship with Classmates B and looks forward to wearing a black suit to a wedding reception.\n5. Classmate A has been hiding their feelings for Classmate B and finally confesses to being in love with them.\n6. Classmates A confessed their love for Classmates B, who does not feel the same way.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I think it's the genuine connections we have with each other. Like the one we have, it's really special to me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains information about a significant interaction between Classmates A and B, where Classmate A confessed their love for Classmate B, who did not reciprocate these feelings. This emotional exchange indicates the development and complexity of their relationship, which could influence current interactions, including the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the relevance of these sentiments to the current conversation about the class's unique energy is limited. The main point of discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about the uniqueness of their class, and the MEMORY doesn't directly contribute to developing this topic. There is some potential for use if the conversation shifts towards personal feelings or relationships, making the score higher than 1, but as is, the MEMORY is not currently very helpful for generating the next response related to the class discussion. The sentences are somewhat naturally structured, but their connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is not clearly demonstrated."
