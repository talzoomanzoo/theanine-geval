Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends. Mentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections. Mentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here. Mentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people. Mentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n2. The Mentee has been offered a job and has decided to take the job in the city.\n3. Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process.\n4. The Mentee weighed the pros and cons of each option before deciding on the job in the city.\n5. Mentee agreed to go back to the store to make things right and expressed gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n6. The Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some relevant details about the Mentor and Mentee's past interactions, such as points 1, 2, and 6, which emphasize the Mentor's supportive role and the Mentee's process in making decisions. However, these details are not directly related to the current conversation about the Mentee feeling lonely and needing advice on making new connections, which limits their helpfulness in generating a response to the current dialogue context. Points 3, 4, and 5 appear unrelated to the present context of loneliness and making new friends. Additionally, while some sentences reflect the supportive nature of the Mentor-Mentee relationship, they don't exhibit a clear development or relevance to the current topic, reducing their usefulness. Therefore, the MEMORY only provides limited aid in addressing the dialogue context."
