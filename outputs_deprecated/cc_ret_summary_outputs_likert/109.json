    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax. Neighbors B: What kind of breathing exercise? Neighbors A: It's just a simple one, where you inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, and then exhale for eight seconds. I've been doing it every day for the past week and it's made such a difference.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A is willing to take things slow in their relationship with Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbors A did this as a gesture of appreciation for Neighbors B's actions in the neighborhood.\n3. Neighbor B reassures Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasizes their current friendship.\n4. Neighbors A has developed romantic feelings for Neighbors B.\n5. Neighbors B values their friendship with Neighbors A.\n6. Neighbor A and Neighbor B found a park together a couple of years ago and enjoyed playing frisbee and having a picnic.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds really calming. I'm glad it's been helping you relax. Maybe I should give it a try too.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context discusses a breathing exercise and its benefits, while the memory focuses on personal relationships and shared experiences between Neighbors A and B. There is no mention of relaxation, breathing, or stress relief in the MEMORY, making it unhelpful for generating a relevant response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The information about past relationship dynamics and shared activities between the neighbors does not provide useful contextual cues for continuing the specific topic at hand."
