Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly. Neighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A enjoys living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbors A is excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends.\n3. Neighbors B acknowledges Neighbors A's friendly and outgoing nature.\n4. Neighbors A appreciates having friendly faces around and hopes to make new friends soon.\n5. Neighbors A found a park and a coffee shop nearby that they want to visit.\n6. Neighbor A has been living in the same place for a long time and enjoys the neighborhood and people there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some contextual information about the relationship and shared environment of Neighbors A and B, but it is not directly helpful for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY focuses on Neighbors A's enjoyment of their neighborhood and desire to make new friends, which is tangentially related to the context of visiting a new city. However, it does not provide specific information about travel, architecture, or Neighbors A's experiences that would inform a response to the question about which city they visited. The MEMORY is structured in a way that suggests a friendly relationship between the neighbors, but lacks direct relevance to the conversation about the city visit. A more helpful MEMORY would contain details about past travel experiences or specific interests that relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
