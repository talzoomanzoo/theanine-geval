Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A is excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends.\n2. Neighbors A appreciates having friendly faces around and hopes to make new friends soon.\n3. Neighbors A just moved to a new neighborhood and is getting to know the area.\n4. Neighbors B acknowledges Neighbors A's friendly and outgoing nature.\n5. Neighbor A has been living in the same place for a long time and enjoys the neighborhood and people there.\n6. Neighbors A enjoys living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like an incredible experience! It's always great to explore new places and meet friendly people along the way.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information about Neighbors A being friendly and getting to know the area, which loosely connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about visiting a new city and appreciating friendly people. However, most sentences in MEMORY do not directly relate to the discussion of the new city visited in the dialogue context. Furthermore, there are some contradictory statements, such as Neighbors A having just moved to a new neighborhood and Neighbors A having lived in the same place for a long time. These contradictions can confuse the language model rather than help it generate an accurate response. Therefore, while there is a slight connection, MEMORY lacks coherence and relevancy to effectively assist in generating the next response."
