Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that. Neighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset? Neighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore. Neighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it? Neighbors A: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end job. Neighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you considered looking for a new job? Neighbors A: I have, but with the current job market, it's really tough. Plus, I don't have a lot of experience in other fields.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\n2. Neighbors A and B live in the same neighborhood and help each other with tasks.\n3. Neighbors B recalls when Neighbors A helped with their lawn, showing mutual support between them.\n4. Neighbors A and B are helpful towards each other.\n5. Neighbors A wants to rearrange their living room and Neighbors B has experience with rearranging furniture.\n6. Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains pieces of information that are somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 4 suggest a supportive and understanding relationship between Neighbors A and B, which aligns with Neighbors B's reaction to Neighbors A's frustration in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the rest of the MEMORY lacks direct relevance to the current conversation about work frustrations. Sentences 2, 3, 5, and 6 do provide background context about the neighbors' supportive dynamic, which helps in understanding their relationship, but these sentences do not specifically pertain to the work-related issues raised in the conversation. Overall, the MEMORY gives some helpful contextual information but does not directly aid in addressing the current discussion about Neighbors A's job frustration, making it moderately helpful."
