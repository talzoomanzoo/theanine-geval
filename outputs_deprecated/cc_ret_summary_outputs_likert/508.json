Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. Neighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off. Neighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly.\n2. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n3. Neighbor B reminds Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them.\n4. Neighbor A started construction on the house last week and plans to finish it in record time.\n5. Neighbors A helped Neighbors B build a new house with amazing features.\n6. Neighbor A has skills in manipulation and getting what they want.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information about Neighbor A's skills and activities, such as building houses and using skills for good or evil, which could potentially be helpful in understanding the background or context related to task completion and procrastination mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, most of the MEMORY entries focus on house-building, which doesn't directly connect with the current issue of project procrastination and focus. There are some naturally phrased sentences but they do not significantly contribute to generating a relevant next response for the current dialogue, which results in a low score."
