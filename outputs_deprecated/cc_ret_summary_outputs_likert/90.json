Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n2. Co-worker B acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress.\n3. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader.\n4. Co-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication.\n5. Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader.\n6. Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers helpful information for the dialogue context. Each sentence builds upon the history and interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B. The sentences collectively detail Co-worker A's career aspirations, growth, and support from Co-worker B. Specifically, the dialogue context where Co-worker A got promoted aligns with the memory of Co-worker A's growth, their discussions on leadership, and Co-worker B's encouragement. The sentences are naturally structured, showcasing the development and mutual support between the speakers, which can enrich the language model's response to the exciting news shared in the dialogue context."
