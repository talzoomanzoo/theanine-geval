Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I really enjoy being a carpenter. It's a very fulfilling job.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate B is supportive and encourages Classmate A to pursue their dream.\n2. Classmates A is willing to work hard and learn the necessary strategies for business success.\n3. Classmates A is attending a seminar on starting a business and is excited about applying that knowledge to future plans.\n4. Classmates A appreciates the support and encouragement from Classmates B.\n5. Classmates B is supportive and encourages Classmates A in their business venture.\n6. Classmate A wants to pursue a dream of becoming a singer.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 4, and 5 emphasize the supportive nature of Classmate B, which is relevant to the context where Classmate A expresses fulfillment in their job. This suggests a supportive relationship, which can be useful for the language model to consider when generating responses. Sentence 3 also provides context about Classmate A's proactive approach towards their career, which aligns with the sentiment expressed in the dialogue. However, Sentence 6 introduces a different aspiration (becoming a singer), which does not align with the current context of enjoying being a carpenter. While some sentences are naturally structured, there are also redundant repetitions of ideas (e.g., both Sentence 1 and 5 convey that Classmate B is supportive), and not all sentences contribute directly to the context. Therefore, the memory is moderately helpful but could be more cohesive and focused on the current dialogue context."
