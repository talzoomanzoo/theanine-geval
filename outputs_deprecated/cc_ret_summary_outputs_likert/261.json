Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful. Co-workers B: Did you make sure to include all the necessary details?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B finished a project and sent it to the manager for review.\n2. Co-worker B appreciates the pen and thanks Co-worker A for the gesture.\n3. Co-worker A believes the project will be approved with flying colors.\n4. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a thoughtful gesture.\n5. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen that they still use.\n6. Co-worker B acknowledges the importance of finding a balance between work and relaxation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I made sure to include everything. I even gave her a pen as a small token of appreciation.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks direct connection and essential details. The memory mentions that Co-worker B finished a project and sent it for review, which might be seen as somewhat related to Co-worker A giving a written report to their boss, but it doesn't directly lend much insight into the specific interaction or provide necessary cues for generating a response. Other details, such as the gesture of giving a pen and acknowledgment of work-life balance, are not directly relevant to the context provided and don't help develop the immediate interaction or conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, while there are some elements that might contribute slightly to understanding past interactions, the lack of direct relevance and connection between MEMORY and DIALOGUE CONTEXT reduces its helpfulness."
