Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A started construction on the house last week and plans to finish it in record time.\n2. Neighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly.\n3. Neighbor B is looking forward to seeing the finished house and is excited about the new project.\n4. Neighbors A found building the new house challenging but rewarding.\n5. Neighbor B has not been up to anything interesting lately but is excited about the new house and looking forward to it.\n6. Neighbors A helped Neighbors B build a new house with amazing features.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Don't worry, you've got this! Remember how you finished the last project in record time? You'll do great with this one too.",
    "prediction": "2\n\nThe MEMORY contains information that could be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, Neighbor A's involvement in construction projects and finishing them quickly (MEMORY sentences 1 and 2) reveals a past interaction where Neighbor A has been actively involved in projects. This could be linked to the current context where Neighbor A is trying to finish a project. However, MEMORY largely focuses on a construction project involving Neighbor A and Neighbor B, but it lacks a clear connection to the current project Neighbor A is struggling to focus on, as mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Furthermore, the MEMORY does not provide direct cues or specific developments that highlight why Neighbor A might be having trouble focusing. The sentences are somewhat naturally phrased, but they do not demonstrate strong relevance or causality to aid the language model in generating an appropriate response for the given context."
