Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A suggests grabbing lunch together, showing an interest in spending more time with Classmates B.\n2. Classmates A and B have a good relationship, with Classmates A expressing admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor.\n3. Both Classmates A and B enjoy talking to each other and consider themselves great study partners.\n4. Classmates A has developed a crush on Classmates B, which Classmates B finds flattering.\n5. Both Classmates A and B are open to exploring a romantic connection and are looking forward to getting to know each other better.\n6. Classmates A and B are interested in biology and studying cells.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've really enjoyed our time together studying biology and talking about cells. I was wondering if you'd like to grab lunch together sometime and maybe explore more than just being study partners.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that can be helpful for generating a next response based on the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes a clear background for the interaction by highlighting the friendly and potentially romantic relationship between Classmates A and B. Particularly, it mentions that Classmates A has a crush on Classmates B and that both are open to exploring a romantic connection, which can naturally inform the tone of Classmates A's \"important\" conversation in the context. Additionally, MEMORY indicates a shared interest in biology, which might also relate to the conversation.\n\nThe sentences in the MEMORY are naturally structured and demonstrate the development of the relationship between the two classmates. The connections and past interactions are outlined in a coherent manner. The only aspect that prevents a perfect score is that some details, such as their shared interest in biology and studying, while relevant to their rapport, might not directly inform the serious topic Classmates A wants to address in the context. However, the MEMORY is sufficiently helpful for understanding the dynamic between the two speakers."
