Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful. Co-workers B: Did you make sure to include all the necessary details? Co-workers A: Yes, I made sure to cover everything we talked about in the meeting. I even added some extra information that I thought could be useful. Co-workers B: That's smart thinking. It shows that you're invested in the company and want to make sure things run smoothly. Co-workers A: Thanks. I learned a lot from taking over the family business. It taught me the importance of being efficient and proactive. Co-workers B: I remember you telling me about that. It's amazing how much you've accomplished since then. Co-workers A: It's been a journey, but I'm glad to see the business flourishing. It gives me a sense of pride and accomplishment. Co-workers B: I can tell. You're always trying to find ways to improve things. Co-workers A: Exactly. That's why I felt a written report would be the best way to communicate the information to my boss. It saves time and ensures everything is organized.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A has a family business that has been doing well recently.\n2. Co-worker B appreciates the pen and thanks Co-worker A for the gesture.\n3. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a thoughtful gesture.\n4. Co-worker A took over their family's business a few years ago and it has improved since then.\n5. Co-worker B finished a project and sent it to the manager for review.\n6. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a symbol of trust in their professional relationship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You have a great approach to handling things. Your dedication and attention to detail really show in your work. It's no wonder the business is doing so well with you at the helm.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not fully comprehensive or seamlessly connected. Relevant entries include the fact that Co-worker A has a family business that has been doing well (#1) and the note that Co-worker A took over their family's business and has improved it since then (#4). These details support the development of the context in which Co-worker A discusses the lessons learned and accomplishments made, which is relevant to their conversation about the report and the importance of being proactive and efficient.\n\nHowever, other entries, such as Co-worker B appreciating and receiving a pen (#2, #3, #6), aren't directly related to the context of submitting the report or the history of Co-worker A's business accomplishments. Though these sentences are naturally phrased, their significance to the ongoing dialogue is unclear or minimal. There's also a mention of Co-worker B finishing a project (#5) that isn't connected to the current conversation direction.\n\nUltimately, while the MEMORY includes some connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, the helpfulness would be increased with fewer unrelated or disjointed entries and by presenting a clearer causality or development related to the ongoing conversation."
