Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today? Co-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing. Co-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\n2. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health.\n3. Co-worker B is supportive and glad that Co-worker A is okay.\n4. Co-worker A values their health to continue working at their best.\n5. Both co-workers are looking forward to starting their partnership and are open to seeking extra help if needed.\n6. Co-worker A is considering seeing a doctor to ensure everything is okay.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. There are useful elements, such as how Co-worker A values their health (4) and both coworkers are open to seeking extra help if needed (5). This information complements their conversation about handling a heavy workload and being open to receiving help. However, the MEMORY could be more specifically tailored to capture the immediate context of the dialogue—Co-worker A offering help to B in the present—and does not elaborate on notable aspects of Co-worker B requiring or discussing needing help. Sentences related to Co-worker B's support role (1, 2, 3) are slightly disconnected from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT provided, as it does not clearly show Co-worker B offering the help, but rather Co-worker A. Some sentences are natural and pertinent, but the connections throughout the memory entries are not explicitly tailored for this specific dialogue, leading to moderate helpfulness rather than highly structured relevance."
