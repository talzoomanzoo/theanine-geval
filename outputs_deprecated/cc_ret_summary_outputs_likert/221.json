Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins. Neighbors B: Oh, okay. I didn't realize there was any confusion about that. Neighbors A: Well, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page. I don't want any misunderstandings in the future. Neighbors B: I understand. Is there anything else we should do to make sure we're clear about this? Neighbors A: I don't think so, but if you have any other suggestions, I'm open to hearing them. Neighbors B: No, I think the line is a good idea. It's clear and simple. Neighbors A: Great. Hey, speaking of lines and boundaries, remember when we talked about my promotion at work? I had to set some clear boundaries with my team about what I expected from them. Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember. How did that go?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B offers to be more supportive and check in on Neighbors A more often.\n2. Neighbors B was read to from a book about personal development by Neighbors A, which had a positive impact on Neighbors A's career growth.\n3. Neighbor A and Neighbor B went to a concert together in the past and had a great time.\n4. Neighbors A believes in setting goals, developing a positive attitude, and taking action for personal development and career advancement.\n5. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's career advancement and expresses interest in borrowing the personal development book.\n6. Both neighbors emphasize the importance of taking care of each other as neighbors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It went really well, actually. Setting those boundaries helped increase efficiency and improve communication within the team. And speaking of work, I'm glad you found the book on personal development helpful. I think you'll really enjoy reading it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information that can be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, entries 1, 4, and 5 relate to concepts of personal development and career advancement, which align with Neighbors A's mention of a promotion and setting boundaries with their team in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These entries suggest past interactions where personal development was emphasized, showcasing character traits and a relationship dynamic that the language model could use to generate a response. However, the MEMORY could be more directly connected to the specific context of discussing property boundaries and workplace boundaries, and entries like 3 and 6 feel less relevant and do not provide clear insight into the context. Overall, there is useful information, but it could be better structured to enhance clarity and relevance."
