Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together. Neighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left? Neighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him. Neighbors B: That's not true, Neighbor A. You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are. Neighbors A: I just feel so lost right now. I don't know how to move on from this. Neighbors B: It's going to take time, but you will get through this. Do you want to talk about how you're feeling or do something to take your mind off of things? Neighbors A: Maybe both? I just feel so overwhelmed and I don't know what to do. Neighbors B: How about we go for a walk and you can talk to me about everything that's been on your mind? Neighbors A: That sounds good. You've always been such a good listener, Neighbor B. Thank you for being there for me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A appreciates the emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during their time of grief.\n2. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n3. Neighbor A finds solace in nature and believes that it helps in coping with their emotions.\n4. Neighbors A and Neighbors B enjoy going for walks together, especially to the park.\n5. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have a close friendship and have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n6. Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Of course, Neighbor A. I'm always here for you, no matter what. Let's take a walk and talk about everything that's weighing on your heart.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that reflects the emotional support and companionship between Neighbor A and Neighbor B, which aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Neighbor B is offering support to Neighbor A after a breakup. The memory points of emotional support (1 and 2) and the close friendship (5) are directly helpful because they provide background into their relationship and why Neighbor B is a good listener. The mention of going for walks to cope with emotions (3 and 4) ties in well with the dialogue's suggestion for a walk to talk things over, establishing a natural causality and shared routine that Neighbors A and B engage in. The mention of grieving the recent loss of the grandmother (6) is less relevant to the dialogue focused on a breakup. However, it helps paint a broader picture of Neighbor A's emotional state, although it might not be immediately useful for generating a next response specific to the breakup. Overall, the MEMORY provides relevant context and is mostly well-connected to the dialogue."
