Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going? Neighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you? Neighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band. Neighbors B: Really? You had a band? Neighbors A: Yeah, we were called \"The Neighbors A Band.\" We used to play live shows around the city.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and Neighbors B enjoy playing together with toys.\n2. Neighbors A looks forward to playing with Neighbors B again when feeling better.\n3. Neighbors A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbors B.\n4. Neighbors B is familiar with Neighbors A's dog and looking forward to playing with it again.\n5. Neighbors A is enjoying the different culture and exploring the city.\n6. Neighbors B expresses concern for Neighbors A's back pain.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does contain some past interactions between Neighbors A and Neighbors B, such as appreciation for support and friendship, and expressions of concern. However, it lacks direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around Neighbors A's past with their rock band. Most of the MEMORY points, like references to playing with toys or a dog, or Neighbors A's exploration of the city, do not provide helpful information for generating the next response about the band story and past experiences. The memories are disconnected and do not follow any clear development or causality with regards to the current conversation. As a result, the MEMORY doesn't help the language model to generate a coherent continuation based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
