Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. Neighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off. Neighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks? Neighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else. Neighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location? Neighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home. Neighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become. Neighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice. Neighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along?  Neighbors A: It's finished! Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. It was a lot of work, but worth it in the end.  Neighbors B: That's amazing, thanks for building me such a beautiful house.  Neighbors A: Of course, I'm glad you like it. Remember when we watched the sunset over the London skyline? That was such a beautiful moment.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A helped Neighbors B build a new house with amazing features.\n2. Neighbor B reminds Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them.\n3. Neighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly.\n4. Neighbor B is looking forward to seeing the finished house and is excited about the new project.\n5. Neighbors A found building the new house challenging but rewarding.\n6. Neighbors B is enjoying the sunset from their new backyard, expressing gratitude towards Neighbors A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, that was such a memorable experience. I'm grateful for all the hard work you put into building our new house. It's truly a dream come true.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that can aid in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it includes details about Neighbor A's involvement in building a house for Neighbor B, which is beneficial since this topic is brought up in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, it highlights Neighbor A's enjoyment and quickness in building houses, suggesting their expertise or interest in construction, which could be useful in the conversation. However, there are some sentences in MEMORY that are not directly relevant or necessary to the ongoing context, such as the anticipation of Neighbor B to see the finished house and the enjoyment of a sunset, which are not mentioned or expanded upon in the dialogue. Overall, while MEMORY contains some useful information, it could improve in providing more cohesively connected sentences that demonstrate the development of events and interactions between the two speakers."
