Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life. Child: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The child is supportive and caring towards the parent.\n2. Both the parent and child express love and support for each other.\n3. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n4. The child is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes.\n5. The parent values independence and self-sufficiency.\n6. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains sentences that are somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as they describe the general feeling of support and appreciation between the parent and the child. However, the connections are not strong or directly aligned with the context of listening and feeling heard. While the MEMORY does provide some contextual cues about the relationship, it lacks specific pertinence to the focus on listening skills discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences are naturally structured but do not clearly demonstrate development or causality related to the specific dialogue exchange. Hence, it provides only moderate helpfulness in generating a next response."
