Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today? Co-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there? Co-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done. Co-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded. Co-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out. Co-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends? Co-workers A: Ugh, don't remind me. That was such a disaster. Co-workers B: It was definitely not one of your finest moments. But it's good to see that you're being responsible now and taking care of things like sending packages. Co-workers A: Thanks. I'm trying to be more responsible and reliable these days. Co-workers B: That's great to hear. It reminds me of the time when you were a great leader in your country. You were strong, determined, and made a positive impact. Co-workers A: Wow, that was a long time ago. But I appreciate the compliment. It's nice to be reminded of my successes.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B is supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable.\n2. Co-worker A was a leader in their country, making it prosperous and safe.\n3. Both co-workers show a supportive and caring attitude towards each other.\n4. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to give people a chance.\n5. Co-worker A believes their success as a leader was due to determination and strength of character.\n6. Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You've always had that determination and strength of character, it's part of what made you such a great leader. Keep up the good work with being responsible and reliable now, it really shows how much you've grown.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information about Co-worker A's past experiences and character development, which is useful for understanding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, memory points 1, 2, and 5 mention Co-worker A's efforts to be more responsible and refer to their past leadership, aligning closely with the conversation. These points help to contextualize the conversation by connecting past interactions with the dialogue context. However, the points in MEMORY are somewhat repetitive (e.g., points 1 and 4 offering similar information about Co-worker B's supportive nature), and memory point 6 introduces an idea not explicitly discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, slightly reducing coherence. Nonetheless, the MEMORY offers a good foundation for understanding the characters' relationship and past interactions."
