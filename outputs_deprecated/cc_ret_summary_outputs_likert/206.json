    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn. Teacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation? Student: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle. Teacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time? Student: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then. Teacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going? Student: It's going pretty well. I started with French, but now I'm considering taking up Spanish and German too. I want to become more well-rounded.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The student is studying French at college and plans on learning Spanish and German as well.\n2. The teacher speaks Spanish and French fluently.\n3. The teacher and student have a positive and understanding relationship.\n4. The student mentioned feeling stressed lately, which may have led to the outburst.\n5. The student believes in the importance of continuous learning and growth.\n6. The teacher expressed understanding and encouraged the student to seek help when needed.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fantastic to hear! Learning multiple languages can open up so many opportunities for you. I'm here to support you on your language learning journey whenever you need it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides information that is relevant and helpful for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Key points from the MEMORY, such as the student's intention to learn multiple languages (French, Spanish, and German) and the teacher's fluency in Spanish and French, are directly related to their conversation about language studying. The MEMORY also captures the positive and understanding relationship between the student and teacher (points 3 and 5), which is evident in their conversation. Additionally, point 6 about the teacher encouraging seeking help complements the supportive nature depicted in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Though not all points are immediately relevant to the current dialogue, the MEMORY is well-structured and presents useful contextual cues that could help develop future dialogue."
