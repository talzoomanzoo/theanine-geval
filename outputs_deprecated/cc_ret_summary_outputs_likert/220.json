Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins. Neighbors B: Oh, okay. I didn't realize there was any confusion about that. Neighbors A: Well, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page. I don't want any misunderstandings in the future. Neighbors B: I understand. Is there anything else we should do to make sure we're clear about this? Neighbors A: I don't think so, but if you have any other suggestions, I'm open to hearing them. Neighbors B: No, I think the line is a good idea. It's clear and simple. Neighbors A: Great. Hey, speaking of lines and boundaries, remember when we talked about my promotion at work? I had to set some clear boundaries with my team about what I expected from them.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B offers to be more supportive and check in on Neighbors A more often.\n2. Neighbors A believes in setting goals, developing a positive attitude, and taking action for personal development and career advancement.\n3. Both neighbors emphasize the importance of taking care of each other as neighbors.\n4. Neighbors B was read to from a book about personal development by Neighbors A, which had a positive impact on Neighbors A's career growth.\n5. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's career advancement and expresses interest in borrowing the personal development book.\n6. Neighbors A offers to help Neighbors B with getting into a workout routine.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's awesome to hear! Setting boundaries and expectations is crucial for success in any aspect of life. It sounds like your career growth is really taking off.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a moderate level of helpful information for generating a proper next response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The mention of boundaries and personal development is relevant, as it aligns with Neighbors A's comment about setting boundaries with their team following a promotion at work. However, while MEMORY mentions related topics such as personal development, career advancement, and mutual support, these points are not directly linked to the immediate property boundary discussion between the neighbors. \n\nMEMORY contains background information about the neighbors' relationship and interests, especially around career growth and personal development, which could be useful in further conversation development. However, these details remain somewhat disconnected, without a clear causality or development relevant to the ongoing boundary dialogue. While MEMORY is coherent and well-structured, it could be more directly tied to the specific context of managing property boundaries and misunderstandings as raised in the dialogue."
