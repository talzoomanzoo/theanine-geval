Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband got impatient and excited about his plans, leading him to leave without the wife.\n2. The husband is inspired by his wife to take action on his dreams and goals.\n3. The husband apologized and promised to involve the wife in his plans in the future.\n4. The husband has long-awaited plans and is finally taking action on them.\n5. The wife offers her support and encouragement to the husband in his journey towards achieving his dreams.\n6. The wife supports the husband's goals but wanted to be involved in them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a wonderful idea, I would love that! Thank you for thinking of us spending more time together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 2, 5, and 6 highlight the wife's support and inspiration for the husband's plans and goals, which can be relevant in understanding their dynamics for planning a getaway. Sentences 1 and 3 introduce a past conflict where the husband left without the wife, apologizing and promising to include her. This could be helpful in understanding the context of their conversation. Sentence 4 mentions long-awaited plans but lacks direct connection to the current context of going on a getaway. Overall, while some parts of the memory are relevant and helpful, others are less directly related, hence a moderate score."
