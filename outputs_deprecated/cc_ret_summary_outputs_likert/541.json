    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind? Classmates A: I know about your affair with that other woman. Classmates B: What are you talking about? I don't have an affair with anyone. Classmates A: Don't lie to me! I saw you together at the restaurant last week. Classmates B: That was just a business meeting. We were discussing a potential collaboration on a music project. Classmates A: I don't believe you. You're just trying to cover it up. I'm going to tell everyone and ruin your career. Classmates B: Why are you doing this? I thought we were friends. Classmates A: I can't stand that you're a better singer than I am. I'm envious of your talent and success. Classmates B: That's not a reason to try and destroy my life. If you're feeling insecure about your own abilities, that's something you need to work on. Don't take it out on other people. Classmates A: I know, I know. I'm sorry,. I was wrong to even think about doing something like that. Can you forgive me?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B have a good relationship, with Classmates A expressing admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor.\n2. Classmates A has developed a crush on Classmates B, which Classmates B finds flattering.\n3. Both Classmates A and B enjoy talking to each other and consider themselves great study partners.\n4. Classmates A suggests grabbing lunch together, showing an interest in spending more time with Classmates B.\n5. Both Classmates A and B are open to exploring a romantic connection and are looking forward to getting to know each other better.\n6. Classmate A loves Lady Gaga's music and message of acceptance and inclusivity.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate your apology and I forgive you. Let's focus on supporting each other's talents and working together instead of letting jealousy get in the way.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY does provide some context about the relationship between Classmates A and B, including their previously good rapport, mutual admiration, and potential romantic interest. This information could be somewhat helpful in understanding the emotional dynamics behind the current conflict in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, it fails to directly inform the specific argument or accusations taking place in the dialogue, such as the affair accusation or the underlying competitive tension regarding singing abilities. The connection between being good study partners or having a crush, as mentioned in MEMORY, doesn't directly relate to the accusations and heated exchange in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, while the MEMORY is somewhat relevant, it misses significant contextual connections and developments that could have made it more helpful."
