Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together. Neighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left? Neighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him. Neighbors B: That's not true, Neighbor A. You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A appreciates the emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during their time of grief.\n2. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n3. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have a close friendship and have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n4. Neighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there.\n5. Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.\n6. Neighbor A finds solace in nature and believes that it helps in coping with their emotions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you for saying that, Neighbor B. It means a lot to hear that from you. Your support really helps me through this tough time.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information for understanding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, especially points 1, 2, and 3. These points highlight the supportive relationship between Neighbor A and Neighbor B, which is relevant to the current dialogue where Neighbor B is offering emotional support to Neighbor A. However, the other memory points (4, 5, and 6) are less directly connected to the ongoing conversation about Neighbor A's recent breakup. Though they provide context about Neighbor A's character and current state, they do not directly aid in generating the next response related to the immediate situation. Overall, MEMORY is somewhat helpful but lacks focused information on the breakup discussion."
