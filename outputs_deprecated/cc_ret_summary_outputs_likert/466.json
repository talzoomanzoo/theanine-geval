Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess. Classmates B: Wait, what? You cheated on your taxes? That's not okay. Classmates A: I know, I know. I was just really struggling financially and I thought I could get away with it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate B reassures Classmate A that they are all in it together and offers help if needed.\n2. Classmate A appreciates the support and understanding from Classmate B.\n3. Classmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed.\n4. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to keep pushing themselves and not let doubts hold them back.\n5. Classmate A has tried practicing in front of others but still feels nervous.\n6. Classmate B brought goods to Classmate A's house and is supportive of their basketball dream.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some helpful information related to supporting Classmate A, which is somewhat relevant to the context of Classmate A's admission of cheating due to financial struggles. The MEMORY demonstrates a supportive and encouraging relationship between Classmate A and Classmate B through the actions and advice provided by Classmate B. However, the specifics listed (e.g., practicing in front of others and basketball dream) are not directly connected to the dialogue context and Classmate A's situation with taxes. The sentences are naturally phrased, providing a picture of the supportive interactions between Classmates A and B, but the relevance to the given dialogue context is quite minimal. More specific details about handling the current tax issue would enhance the relevance. Therefore, it scores a 2 for providing general support context with limited relevance to the specific issue at hand."
