Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately. Classmates B: Why is that? Classmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically. Classmates B: That's a good goal to have. Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A is always looking to challenge themselves and improve their skills.\n2. Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness.\n3. Classmates A is struggling with feeling competitive and the need to be the best at everything.\n4. Classmates A faced tough competition in middle school from a fast girl, motivating them to improve.\n5. Classmates B is supportive and emphasizes the importance of having someone to talk to about personal matters.\n6. Classmates B emphasizes the importance of enjoying the journey and effort put in, not just focusing on winning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, I think so. It's definitely challenging me, but I can feel myself getting better at problem-solving. It's just hard not to get caught up in wanting to be the best at it all the time.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that provides some context for Classmates A's interest in improving skills, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Classmates A discusses studying algebra to improve logical and critical thinking. Specifically, sentences 1, 3, and 4 relate to Classmates A's drive for self-improvement and competitiveness, which gives insight into their motivation for focusing on algebra. Sentence 2 shows Classmates B's recognition of Classmates A's determination, aligning with the supportive tone in the conversation.\n\nHowever, sentences 5 and 6, while naturally phrased and helping understand the general relationship between Classmates A and B, are less directly relevant to the specific context of studying algebra. They speak to broader themes of support and enjoying the process, which, although important, don't directly contribute to generating a specific next response about Classmates A's progress in thinking from studying algebra.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides some helpful context but doesn't fully align with the immediate focus of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is on the impact of studying algebra on Classmates A's thinking."
