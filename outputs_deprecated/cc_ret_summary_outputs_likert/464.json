Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate B reassures Classmate A that they are all in it together and offers help if needed.\n2. Classmate A appreciates the support and understanding from Classmate B.\n3. Classmate A has tried practicing in front of others but still feels nervous.\n4. Classmate A is nervous about an upcoming presentation and has been practicing a lot.\n5. Classmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed.\n6. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to keep pushing themselves and not let doubts hold them back.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks clear connectivity and organization. Sentence 1 mentions Classmate B offering help and support to Classmate A, which aligns with the dialogue's theme of Classmate A being in a predicament. Sentence 2 reinforces the supportive relationship by highlighting Classmate A's appreciation for Classmate B's understanding. This provides context for the supportive interactions between them.\n\nHowever, sentences 3 and 4 introduce a completely different topicâ€”Classmate A's nervousness about an upcoming presentation. This is unrelated to the issue of cheating on taxes, which is the central topic in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 5 and 6 offer general advice for staying focused and pushing past doubts, which could apply to various contexts but are not specifically tied to the cheating issue in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY has partial relevance due to sentences 1 and 2, which are helpful in showing the supportive dynamic between the classmates. The presence of unrelated sentences (3, 4, 5, and 6) disperses the focus and reduces the overall helpfulness for directly generating a response to the current context. The formulation of unrelated memories is more disconnected, requiring significant inference which may not be clear without more direct connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
