Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I know you know something about my past. Can you tell me what it is? Classmates B: I'm sorry,, but I can't disclose that information. It's not my place to tell. Classmates A: But how did you find out? I haven't told anyone. Classmates B: Let's just say I have my ways of finding out things. But don't worry,, it's nothing bad or embarrassing.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B warns Classmates A about the potential danger of dark alleys.\n2. Classmates A is curious and open to exploring new things and taking risks.\n3. Classmates A encountered a mysterious woman in a dark alley, finding her intriguing.\n4. Classmates B advises Classmates A to be careful and aware while on the bus.\n5. Classmates A and B became friends when Classmates A transferred to the school.\n6. Classmates A was nervous about fitting in but saw Classmates B as well-liked and wanted to be friends with them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some pieces of information that could be seen as relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not very directly connected. Sentences 1, 3, and 6 are somewhat helpful, as they indicate previous interactions between Classmates A and B and hint at potentially relevant topics like dark alleys and friendship formation. However, they do not provide concrete details that closely relate to the issue of how Classmates B knows about Classmates A's past. Sentences 2, 4, and 5 offer context about Classmates A's general personality and their relationship, but do not directly offer information that helps understand the current conversation about past knowledge. Overall, some sentences provide a bit of context relevant to understanding the relationship dynamics but are not critically helpful in developing traits related specifically to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.
