Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A has experience dealing with challenging clients and emphasizes the importance of communication and setting expectations.\n2. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs.\n3. Co-worker A agrees to be more conscious of how they come across to others in the future.\n4. Co-worker B is supportive and interested in the evidence collected by Co-worker A.\n5. Co-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\n6. Co-worker A plans to present the evidence clearly and persuasively in court.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! Your passion for public speaking really shines through when you're up there. I'm sure your message will resonate with the audience.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some helpful information that indicates Co-worker A has experience with communication, which aligns with their interest in public speaking mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, MEMORY sentence 1 speaks to Co-worker A's experience in communication, which is relevant to the context of public speaking. Sentence 2 shows that Co-worker A is commendable for defending beliefs, which may relate to confidently speaking in public. Additionally, sentence 6 suggests Co-worker A's skill in presenting evidence, which may further indicate expertise in public speaking contexts. However, not all sentences in MEMORY are directly connected to the main theme of public speaking or interactions related to it, such as sentence 5, which focuses more on evidence and clients rather than public speaking.\n\nOverall, there is some relevant and helpful content, though not consistently presented in a way that directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The connection and relevance are somewhat present but could be stronger to better facilitate generating a next response."
