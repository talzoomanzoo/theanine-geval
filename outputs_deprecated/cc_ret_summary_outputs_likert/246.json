    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A is enjoying the different culture and exploring the city.\n2. Neighbors A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbors B.\n3. Neighbors A looks forward to playing with Neighbors B again when feeling better.\n4. Neighbors B is familiar with Neighbors A's dog and looking forward to playing with it again.\n5. Neighbor B is interested in chiropractic care after hearing about Neighbor A's positive experience.\n6. Neighbors B expresses concern for Neighbors A's back pain.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that can aid in generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences in Memory provide some context about the interactions between the neighbors, such as enjoying the city, appreciation for support, shared activities, and interest in chiropractic care. However, the memory is lacking in causality or flow in their past interactions, which would help in understanding development without additional context. The information is somewhat scattered, meaning not all sentences align directly with the given dialogue. While the sentences in memory do indicate some positive interactions, providing a context in which the dialogue resides, the sentences lack a strong, cohesive narrative making it hard to integrate them naturally into a specific response without more context."
