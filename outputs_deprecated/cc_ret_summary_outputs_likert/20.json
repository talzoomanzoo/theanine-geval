Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A is known for being competent and is trusted with important projects.\n2. Co-worker A enjoys helping others and takes pride in their work.\n3. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.\n4. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's competence and effort in their work.\n5. Co-worker A strives to do their best in their work.\n6. Co-worker A is seen as competent and reliable by Co-worker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You may be the boss, but Co-worker A's competence and dedication make all of our jobs easier. Their work ethic is truly commendable.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains information that is relevant and useful for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT (\"I'm the boss!\"). Most sentences are connected to Co-worker A's competence, work ethic, and how they are perceived in the workplace, which aligns with the authoritative statement made in the context. These snippets help in understanding Co-worker A's role, their interactions, and how they are viewed by Co-worker B. This can aid in crafting a response that acknowledges or expands upon Co-worker A's characteristics or role as a leader. However, while the sentences are well-structured and convey useful information about Co-worker A, there isn't explicit dialogue development or clear causality related to the context. Thus, it earns a score of 4, as the information is helpful but could benefit from more direct links to the context statement."
