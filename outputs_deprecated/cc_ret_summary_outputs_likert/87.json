Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, have you checked out my new blog? It's all about promoting under-the-radar artists. Classmates B: I haven't had a chance to yet, but that sounds really cool! What inspired you to start it? Classmates A: Well, I've always had a passion for the arts, but I was too afraid to pursue it. I finally realized that it's what I really love, and I wanted to share that love with others. Classmates B: That's amazing. It takes a lot of courage to pursue your passions like that. Classmates A: Yeah, it was scary at first, but the response has been really positive. I'm so glad I finally decided to take the leap. Classmates B: I'm proud of you. It's always great to see someone following their dreams.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A has been pursuing their passions and enjoying life.\n2. Classmates B encouraged Classmates A to step out of their comfort zone and try new things for personal growth.\n3. Both Classmates A and B value the importance of trying new things and taking risks for personal development.\n4. Classmates A ended up taking Classmates B's advice and found success with it.\n5. Classmates B expresses a desire to see Classmates A happy and successful in life.\n6.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information about the interactions and relationship between Classmates A and B. It captures key elements of the past dialogues, such as Classmates A pursuing their passions, Classmates B encouraging Classmates A to step out of their comfort zone, and both valuing taking risks for personal development. This closely aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Classmates A talks about starting a blog to promote under-the-radar artists and Classmates B shows support for following one's passions. The MEMORY is naturally structured and shows a clear connection between the sentences, providing a cohesive background to aid in generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
