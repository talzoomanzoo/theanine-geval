Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today? Classmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own. Classmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others. Classmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as evidenced by their conversation about their respective experiences.\n2. Classmates A and B are both keeping up with the homework in their math class.\n3. Classmates B finds it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after a conversation they had about following dreams.\n4. Classmates A enjoys reminiscing about childhood memories, particularly about playing on swings and making music with friends.\n5. Classmates A finds pursuing music rewarding and is passionate about it.\n6. Classmates A and B enjoy jamming together and plan to collaborate on music in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I get that, but remember that it's okay to lean on others for support sometimes. We're a team, and we're here to help each other out. You're not a burden, you're a valued friend.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information about the relationship and shared interests between Classmates A and B, which could help inform the context for the ongoing conversation. For instance, understanding that Classmates A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship (as mentioned in sentence 1) aligns with their current dialogue where Classmates A is empathetic to Classmates B's feelings. The mention of their music collaboration (sentences 3, 5, and 6) hints at shared activities they enjoy, which might be relevant for suggesting coping mechanisms or distractions during frustrating times. However, some details (sentences 2 and 4) are less directly relevant to the current dialogue context about feelings of dependency and frustration, thus not crucial for generating the next response. Overall, the MEMORY is informative but could be more tightly connected to the specific emotional context of the conversation."
