Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends. Mentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections. Mentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here. Mentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people. Mentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering. Mentor: And remember, it's also important to keep in touch with your old friends. You can schedule video calls or even plan a visit back home. Mentee: That's true, I'll make sure to keep in touch. Thanks for the advice, Mentor. Mentor: Anytime, Mentee. Is there anything else you want to talk about or any updates you'd like to share? Mentee: Actually, I did make a new friend at work. We've been hanging out after work sometimes and it's been nice.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n2. Mentee agreed to go back to the store to make things right and expressed gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n3. The Mentee has been offered a job and has decided to take the job in the city.\n4. The Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process.\n5. The Mentor is supportive and praises the Mentee for their mature decision-making process.\n6. The Mentee weighed the pros and cons of each option before deciding on the job in the city.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provided does not score highly in terms of helpfulness for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. There are several reasons for this: \n\n- The MEMORY entries largely focus on different contexts and interactions between the Mentor and Mentee that are not related to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, they refer to a job offer and decision-making process, which are not relevant to the topic of feeling lonely in a new city and trying to make new connections.\n\n- Some entries (like Memory 1) could be tangentially related in that they emphasize the Mentor's reassurance, but they are framed in the context of a different topic (students working at their own pace), and not directly about dealing with loneliness or making friends in a new environment.\n\n- Memory 3 through 6 pertain to the Mentee's job decisions and process of making that decision, which could potentially serve as background information about the Mentee's experiences but do not provide direct contextual cues relevant to the immediate scenario discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\n- The sentences in MEMORY are well-structured and coherent, but they lack a clear connectivity to the present situation described. There are no direct past interactions or memories concerning the current issue of loneliness or the specific advice of joining clubs, volunteering, or maintaining old friendships.\n\nThese factors collectively suggest that while the MEMORY holds coherent information, it offers limited relevance or useful context for the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT, thus warranting the rating of 2."
