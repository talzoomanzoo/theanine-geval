    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. Neighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off. Neighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks? Neighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else. Neighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location? Neighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n2. Neighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly.\n3. Neighbor B reminds Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them.\n4. Neighbor A and Neighbor B discuss organizing a community event to make a positive impact and appreciate the beauty of their city.\n5. Neighbors A helped Neighbors B build a new house with amazing features.\n6. Neighbors A enjoys taking care of flowers and finds it calming.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains sentences that show a past interaction between Neighbor A and Neighbor B, primarily revolving around building houses and appreciating community efforts. However, the information provided is not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT in terms of providing context or facilitating the conversation about procrastination and improving focus. The MEMORY outlines positive past interactions, but it lacks direct connectivity to the current dialogue. While some sentences are naturally structured, they offer minimal assistance to generate the next response pertinent to the context of overcoming procrastination."
