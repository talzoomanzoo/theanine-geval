Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you. Classmates B: Oh really? What are they? Classmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners. Classmates B: Wow, that sounds amazing! What kind of project are you thinking about? Classmates A: I was thinking about starting a marketing agency specialized in social media. Classmates B: That's a great idea! I'd love to work with you on that. We could really make a difference in the industry. Classmates A: Yes, exactly! And I think our skills complement each other's so well. Classmates B: I totally agree. You're so creative and outgoing, while I'm more analytical and detail-oriented. Classmates A: It's like we were meant to work together, right? Classmates B: Absolutely! I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. Classmates A: Me too. And honestly, it's a bit of a relief to finally have a solid plan for the future. Classmates B: Yeah, I get that. Speaking of the future, how have you been doing with your sleeping problems? Classmates A: It's been a slow process, but I've been making progress with it. I started doing yoga and meditation before bed, and that's been helping a lot. Classmates B: That's great to hear. And what about your past struggles with school and friendships? Do you feel like you've moved on from that?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n2. Classmates A is looking forward to meeting up with Classmates B again after getting better sleep.\n3. Classmate A and Classmate B both enjoy socializing and going out to parties together.\n4. Classmate A encourages Classmate B to initiate conversations and be friendly to make new friends.\n5. Classmates A considers talking to a therapist or counselor to address past issues.\n6. Classmate A and Classmate B enjoy singing karaoke together and look forward to future outings.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it does not fully align with the ongoing topics in the dialogue. Sentences 1 and 5 somewhat relate to the conversation, touching on themes of working through feelings and addressing past issues, which can aid in generating a response about personal development and future plans. However, other sentences about socializing, parties, and singing karaoke (sentences 3 and 6) do not directly connect to the specific context of starting a business or overcoming sleeping problems and past struggles mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While these sentences are naturally phrased, they may not be immediately recognizable as beneficial for the current dialogue topic. Thus, while MEMORY contains relevant elements, the overall connections and relevancy are not strong, resulting in a moderate score."
