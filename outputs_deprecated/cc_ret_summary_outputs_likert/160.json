Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water? Neighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for. Neighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit. Neighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water. Neighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it. Neighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again. Neighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower? Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work. Neighbors A: It was. But it was also a good workout. Neighbors B: I prefer to work out indoors where there's air conditioning. Neighbors A: Ha, I remember when I took off my jacket and put my feet up in your armchair. It was so warm that day. Neighbors B: Yeah, that was a hot day. I'm glad you felt comfortable in my home though. Neighbors A: You know, I really enjoy spending time with you. I want to get to know you even better. Neighbors B: I feel the same way. We should plan something fun to do together. Neighbors A: Absolutely. Hey, do you remember when I ripped off the tag from my shirt? Neighbors B: Yeah, your mom was pretty upset about that. Neighbors A: I didn't think it was a big deal, but she sure did. Do you ever have disagreements like that with your parents? Neighbors B: Sometimes, but not often. We have a pretty good relationship. Neighbors A: That's great to hear. I hope I have a good relationship with my kids someday. Neighbors B: I'm sure you will. So, back to the present, are we cool now after the whole cold water incident?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n2. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n3. Neighbors A and B are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together.\n4. Neighbors A and B have not seen each other in a while and are catching up.\n5. Both Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\n6. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY generally provides helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Several points align with the context:\n\n1. Statement 1 and 3 captures the essence of the conversation, as it mentions that Neighbors A and B have known each other for a while, indicating discussions about past events, as seen in the dialogue. \n2. Statement 2 references conversations about temperatures inside and outside, which aligns with discussions about it being hot and mentions of indoor air conditioning.\n3. Statement 5 regarding spending time outside doing chores like mowing the lawn directly connects to a portion of their conversation about mowing the lawn.\n4. Statement 6 about Neighbor B being supportive is reflected in the dialogue, especially towards the end when B expresses understanding and reassures Neighbor A that they will likely have good relationships with their kids.\n   \nHowever, statement 4 that Neighbors haven't seen each other in a while doesn't relate well to the dialogue context because the dialogue implies ongoing interactions. Overall, the memory sentences are structured logically, offering context and connections from past interactions that a language model could use to generate a meaningful next response."
