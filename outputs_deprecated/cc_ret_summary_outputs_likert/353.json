Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me. Co-workers B: That's amazing to hear. Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job. Co-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work. Co-workers B: It's great to have that kind of positive reinforcement. Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated? Co-workers A: Oh yeah, I remember. I was so angry after blowing up that rabbit with the dynamite. But talking it out with you really helped me work through my emotions. Co-workers B: That's right. It's important to have someone to talk to when you're feeling overwhelmed or upset. Co-workers A: And speaking of talking it out, do you remember when I was a kid and I ran to our parents screaming because of that spider? Co-workers B: Ha, yes I do! It's funny to think about now, but phobias are no laughing matter.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B acknowledges that some people have fears and suggests finding healthy ways to deal with frustrations.\n2. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to try relaxation techniques or find a hobby to de-stress and overcome fears.\n3. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.\n4. Co-worker B was nervous about working with Co-worker A because of their talent as an actor.\n5. Co-worker A had a childhood experience of freaking out over a spider.\n6. Co-worker A felt remorse for what they did and appreciated Co-worker B's understanding.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, thus providing a helpful foundation for generating a response. Sentences 1, 3, 5, and 6 clearly depict past interactions and the development of the relationship between Co-workers A and B. Sentence 5 relates to the childhood spider incident mentioned in the Dialogue Context, making it directly relevant and supportive. Sentence 3 highlights their collaboration during the movie shoot, which is closely related to the referenced movie project in the context. Sentences 1 and 6 provide broader context on their mutual understanding and Co-worker B's supportive nature, which is central to the dialogue. Sentence 2, while useful, is slightly more general but still nicely connected to the idea of managing stress and frustration, a theme evident in the conversation. Sentence 4, although not directly tied to elements of the context, adds valuable depth to their professional relationship, resonating with overall themes of their interaction. Therefore, the MEMORY is overall cohesive, informative, and highly relevant."
