Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager! Co-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role. Co-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge. Co-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail. Co-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.

Co-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality. Co-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes. But it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Remember when I was really stressed about you not liking me? Co-workers B: Yeah, I remember. But we worked through it, didn't we? Co-workers A: We definitely did. And it taught me to just take things one step at a time, like I am with this new role. Co-workers B: Exactly, and I'm sure you'll apply that same mentality to your training as well. I remember you were really dedicated to it a couple of years ago.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader.\n2.

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks, I appreciate your support and encouragement. It's been a journey, but I feel like I've really grown and become more confident over the years. I'm excited to see where this new leadership role takes me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that complements the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and aids in generating a proper next response. Sentences 1, 2, and 6 clearly illustrate Co-worker B's encouragement and support for Co-worker A pursuing a leadership position, which is a theme present in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 5 connects with Co-worker A's growth mentioned in the context. Sentence 3 repeats the same idea as sentence 2, which could have been avoided, and sentence 4 only mentions taking on responsibilities without the specifics mentioned in the context. Overall, the MEMORY is helpful but could have been more concise and cohesive without redundancy."
