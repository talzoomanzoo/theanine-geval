    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you. Classmates B: Oh really? What are they? Classmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners. Classmates B: Wow, that sounds amazing! What kind of project are you thinking about? Classmates A: I was thinking about starting a marketing agency specialized in social media. Classmates B: That's a great idea! I'd love to work with you on that. We could really make a difference in the industry.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n2. Classmate A and Classmate B both enjoy socializing and going out to parties together.\n3. Classmate A encourages Classmate B to initiate conversations and be friendly to make new friends.\n4. Classmate A and Classmate B enjoy singing karaoke together and look forward to future outings.\n5. Classmates A and B are open to meeting for coffee again in the future.\n6. Classmates A is social and enjoys meeting new people.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains various sentences about Classmates A and B's past interactions, which are somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, the sentences about socializing, going to parties, and meeting for coffee again (sentences 2, 4, and 5) can give some context to the relationship between Classmates A and B, indicating that they are comfortable with each other and open to engaging in new activities together, which aligns with the idea of working on a project together. \n\nHowever, the majority of the MEMORY does not directly pertain to the idea of starting a business or working on a project. Sentences about encouraging feelings, initiating conversations to make new friends, and enjoying karaoke (sentences 1, 3, and 4) are less relevant. Furthermore, the sentences are somewhat disjointed and don't provide a clear progression of past interactions that directly support the context of starting a marketing agency.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides some useful background about the pair's interpersonal dynamics and their sociability, but lacks specific reference or connection to the business project discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. More directly related and coherent information could be more helpful for generating the next response."
