Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me. Co-workers B: That's amazing to hear. Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job. Co-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work. Co-workers B: It's great to have that kind of positive reinforcement. Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.\n2. Co-worker A and Co-worker B are excited about working on future projects together and even starting their own production company someday.\n3. Co-worker A and Co-worker B met on a movie set and are now good friends.\n4. Co-worker A felt remorse for what they did and appreciated Co-worker B's understanding.\n5. Co-worker B emphasized the importance of learning from mistakes and working together as a team.\n6. Co-worker A is grateful for life experiences and is open to new possibilities in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I remember that moment. I appreciate your understanding and support during that time. It really helped me get through it and learn from the experience.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that helps provide context for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 3 are particularly helpful as they directly relate to the co-workers' past collaboration and friendship, which may give insight into their supportive dynamic. Sentence 4 touches on a past conflict and resolution, potentially reflecting the supportive nature mentioned in the dialogue. Sentence 2 adds context about their shared aspirations, further characterizing their professional relationship. Sentences 5 and 6, while not directly related to the immediate context, naturally fit into the broader narrative of personal and professional growth, which could be useful for a language model. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured and provides a coherent background, making it easy for the language model to generate a relevant and contextually enriched response."
