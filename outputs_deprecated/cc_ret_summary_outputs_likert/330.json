    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned? Classmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed. Classmates A: Embarrassed? Why? Classmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier. Classmates A: Come on, tell me! I won't judge you, I promise. Classmates B: Well, I accidentally spilled my lunch all over myself in front of some people. Classmates A: (laughs) That's it? That's why you're embarrassed? I thought it was something serious.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during the difficult situation.\n2. Classmates B praised Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n3. Classmates A helped Classmates B out of friendship and believes in supporting each other.\n4. Classmate B admires Classmate A's attitude and sees it as a good example for others.\n5. Classmates A is stranded in space, running out of oxygen and feeling lightheaded.\n6. Classmates A mentioned that life is full of surprises and anything is possible.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provided contains sentences that are completely unrelated to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The dialogue context revolves around a light-hearted embarrassment experienced by Classmates B who accidentally spilled their lunch, while the memory is about serious and unrelated situations such as instances in space and expressions of gratitude and admiration. There is no connection, development, or relevance between the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making the MEMORY unhelpful for generating a proper next response in this context."
