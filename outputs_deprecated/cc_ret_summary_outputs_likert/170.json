Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend! Co-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang. Co-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while. Co-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing? Co-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites. Co-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice. Co-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it. Co-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent. Co-workers A: Thanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it. Co-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have a hobby like that. Reminds me of when you uncovered that mystery a while back. You always seem to surprise us with your skills.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together.\n2. Co-worker A has a talent for solving puzzles and mysteries.\n3. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n4. Co-worker A is described as having \"Sherlock Holmes-like skills\" and enjoys solving mysteries.\n5. Co-worker A enjoys solving puzzles and mysteries, even considering becoming a detective.\n6. Co-worker A suggests celebrating their detective work with drinks after work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains somewhat relevant information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. There are references to Co-worker A's talent for solving puzzles and mysteries, which connects to Co-worker B's mention of Co-worker A's past mystery-solving skills in the conversation. However, while this information could potentially be helpful for generating a response about Co-worker A's diverse range of skills, it doesn't directly relate to the singing talent that is the main focus of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. There is also some additional detail provided, such as Co-worker A's \"Sherlock Holmes-like skills\" and the suggestion of celebrating detective work with drinks, which could be valuable for creating a richer dialogue, but these elements are not crucial for the immediate next response. The MEMORY is structured coherently, giving a general sense of Co-worker A's skills and personality, but lacks a direct connection to the main topic of singing that is currently being discussed in the context."
