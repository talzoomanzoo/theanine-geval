    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going? Neighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you? Neighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band. Neighbors B: Really? You had a band?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and Neighbors B enjoy playing together with toys.\n2. Neighbors A looks forward to playing with Neighbors B again when feeling better.\n3. Neighbors A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbors B.\n4. Neighbors B is familiar with Neighbors A's dog and looking forward to playing with it again.\n5. Neighbors A is enjoying the different culture and exploring the city.\n6. Neighbors B expresses concern for Neighbors A's back pain.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, it was a lot of fun. I miss those days sometimes. But I'm grateful for the memories we've made together too.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided does not contain much helpful information that directly aids in generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around Neighbors A's past with a rock band. Most of the past interactions mentioned in MEMORY do not connect to this topic, such as playing with toys, appreciation for friendship, or cultural exploration, thus offering little relevant context for the current conversation. However, the sentence mentioning a concern for back pain (point 6) might faintly provide a context if the dialogue were to take a turn towards health or personal life discussions, yet it does not directly help with continuing a dialogue about a rock band. Additionally, the sentences are clear and reasonably well-structured, but they lack the necessary connection or relevance to score higher."
