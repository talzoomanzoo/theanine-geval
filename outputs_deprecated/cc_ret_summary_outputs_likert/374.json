Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: It's great to have friends who can help each other out, isn't it? Neighbors B: Absolutely. It's a two-way street, and it's important to be there for each other. Neighbors A: I remember when I helped you move last year, and then you watched my cat when I went on vacation. Neighbors B: Yes, and I appreciate it so much. It's always nice to have someone you can count on. Neighbors A: That's true. And speaking of which, I'm helping another friend move next weekend. It'll be a big job, but I know they'd do the same for me. Neighbors B: That's great. And if you need any help, just let me know. Neighbors A: Thanks, I will. I always feel like I can ask for help when I need it, and that's a really good feeling.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the suggestion.\n2. Neighbors B offered to help Neighbors A with the apology process.\n3. Neighbors A bought a necklace from Neighbors B's shop and loves it.\n4. Both neighbors express the difficulty of not being able to adopt all the animals they see but appreciate those who do adopt and give them loving homes.\n5. Neighbors B emphasized the importance of apologizing to show care for the relationship.\n6. Neighbors A was looking for a new necklace and stumbled upon Neighbors B's shop.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains information that may have some relevance to similar themes in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as helping each other and acts of appreciation. However, none of the sentences directly relate to the specific events and exchanges mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as helping with moves, watching pets, or receiving help from Neighbors B for a similar task again. Additionally, the entries in the MEMORY are somewhat disjointed and do not cohesively build upon each other or the current conversation, thus making it difficult for a language model to extract beneficial contextual cues or development from them. As such, while the MEMORY is phrased naturally, it provides minimal supportive information for generating a connected response to the present dialogue context."
