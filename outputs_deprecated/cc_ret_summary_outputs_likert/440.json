Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria. Co-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking? Co-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you? Co-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you. Co-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago? Co-workers B: Yeah, I remember that conversation. What about it? Co-workers A: Well, I wanted to share some good news with you. I've been recently promoted to the night shift and have been doing a great job. I think I've come a long way since those days. Co-workers B: That's awesome, congratulations! I'm proud of you and all the hard work you've put in. You've definitely grown and matured in the workplace.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B reminds Co-worker A of their progress and potential for success.\n2. Co-worker B has moved on from their arrest and appreciates Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior.\n3. Co-worker A is adjusting to the night shift schedule and excited for a promotion.\n4. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n5. Co-worker B complimented Co-worker A's writing skills and reliability as a journalist.\n6. Co-worker A is a journalist who was recently promoted for being reliable.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information that relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it could be improved for clarity and relevance. \n\n1. The first memory point about Co-worker B reminding Co-worker A of their progress and potential for success aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Co-worker A shares their promotion and progress. However, this point could be phrased in a way that more clearly connects it to the specific conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Co-worker A's promotion.\n\n2. The second memory point about Co-worker B moving on from an arrest and appreciating Co-worker A's concern isn't related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context doesn't discuss an arrest, so this detail could be confusing in generating a relevant response.\n\n3. The third memory point about Co-worker A adjusting to the night shift and being excited for a promotion supports the conversation about Co-worker A's recent promotion and work habits. This is a positive contribution to the MEMORY.\n\n4. The fourth memory point about Co-worker B reassuring Co-worker A and encouraging confidence aligns with the support Co-worker B shows in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it could be more directly related to the conversation about responsibility and change.\n\n5. The fifth memory point, about Co-worker B complimenting Co-worker A's writing skills and reliability as a journalist, is useful if the context of being a journalist was discussed in previous interactions. However, it is not directly mentioned in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\n6. Similar to the fifth point, the sixth memory point is not connected to the current dialogue, as being a journalist isn't a topic in the given context.\n\nOverall, while there are connections between the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, some areas could be improved for clarity and better relevance to assist in generating an appropriate response."
