    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you. Classmates B: Oh really? What are they? Classmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners. Classmates B: Wow, that sounds amazing! What kind of project are you thinking about?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate A and Classmate B enjoy singing karaoke together and look forward to future outings.\n2. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n3. Classmate A and Classmate B both enjoy socializing and going out to parties together.\n4. Classmate A encourages Classmate B to initiate conversations and be friendly to make new friends.\n5. Classmates A and B are open to meeting for coffee again in the future.\n6. Classmates A is looking forward to meeting up with Classmates B again after getting better sleep.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The memory contains information about the past interactions between Classmate A and Classmate B, highlighting their social activities such as singing karaoke, going to parties, and meeting for coffee. However, these details are not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on future plans and a potential business partnership project. While there are indications of a positive relationship and a collaborative spirit (information that could be loosely related to the idea of working together), the memory does not directly provide context for Classmate A's proposal of a project or any business-related intentions. The sentences are generally relevant for understanding the friendship, but not particularly helpful for generating the next response based on the specific discussion in the dialogue."
