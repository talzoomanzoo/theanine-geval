Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work. Wife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help. Husband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Wife brings up Sarah, the husband's previous partner, but husband says he hasn't thought about her much.\n2. Wife suggests that husband should try using more modern language to be better understood.\n3. Both the husband and wife express a desire for happiness and understanding in the situation.\n4. The wife compares the situation to when the husband fell asleep during a movie she recommended, indicating past issues in their relationship.\n5. The husband is open to learning more about movies, showing a willingness to try again.\n6. The wife is knowledgeable about movies and is willing to share her passion with the husband.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It wouldn't be a bother at all! I enjoy helping you with your writing and brainstorming together could bring some fresh perspectives. Let's give it a try.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some elements that could be seen as relevant or potentially helpful within the context of the dialogue. For instance, Point 2 (\"Wife suggests that husband should try using more modern language to be better understood\") is somewhat relevant to the husband's struggle with writing, offering an alternate perspective related to writing. However, the rest of the MEMORY includes aspects of past interactions (e.g., references to movies and past relationships) that are not highly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT of the husband's writing block. Despite this, these sentences are structured in a way that reflects the history and dynamics between the couple, enabling a language model to understand aspects of their relationship, but with limited immediate relevance or utility to generating the next response. Hence, a mid-tier score is appropriate."
