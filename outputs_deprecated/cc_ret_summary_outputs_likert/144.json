    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water? Neighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for. Neighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit. Neighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n2. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n3. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n4. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n5. Neighbor A's mom scolds them for ripping off the tag from their new shirt.\n6. Neighbors A and Neighbors B are both neighbors who have known each other for years and have become good friends.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides a general background of the relationship between Neighbors A and B, indicating they are long-time neighbors and friends who have shared various interactions, such as discussing temperatures, being considerate about water needs, and reminiscing about past events. Such context suggests a friendly, familiar relationship, which is somewhat valuable for understanding the dynamic in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the specific incident of pushing someone into cold water is not directly addressed, and key contextual details that could better explain the current tension or lead towards a resolution are missing. Additionally, some sentences are unrelated to the present dialogue, such as Neighbor A's mom's scolding, and do not contribute to understanding the main interaction. Therefore, while the MEMORY provides some foundational information, it lacks specific details to particularly enhance the generation of a suitable next response in the context."
