Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I really enjoy being a carpenter. It's a very fulfilling job. Classmates B: That's great to hear! How did you get into carpentry?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate B is supportive and encourages Classmate A to pursue their dream.\n2. Classmates A appreciates the support and encouragement from Classmates B.\n3. Classmates A is attending a seminar on starting a business and is excited about applying that knowledge to future plans.\n4. Classmates B is supportive and encourages Classmates A in their business venture.\n5. Classmates A wants to get to know Classmates B better and become friends.\n6. Classmate B offers to support and potentially collaborate with Classmate A in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I actually started as a hobby and gradually realized I had a passion for it. Your support and encouragement means a lot to me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains several sentences that indicate a supportive relationship between Classmates A and B, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Classmate B responds positively to Classmate A's enjoyment of carpentry. However, while these sentences provide a general sense of encouragement and positivity from Classmate B, they do not specifically address the question Classmate B asks about how Classmate A got into carpentry. \n\nSentences such as 3, 4, and 6 are somewhat helpful because they demonstrate future-oriented support, and 1 and 2 confirm the mutual encouragement, which could contribute to the overall atmosphere and dynamic in a dialogue response. Sentence 5, focusing on Classmate A's desire to become friends, may not be directly relevant to the current context but shows the evolving nature of their relationship.\n\nOverall, while there is some helpful information regarding the supportive and encouraging dynamic between Classmates A and B, the MEMORY lacks specificity regarding Classmate Aâ€™s journey into carpentry, which is directly relevant to the dialogue's immediate topic. Therefore, it provides a moderate level of helpfulness."
