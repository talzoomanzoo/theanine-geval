Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss! Co-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes. Co-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's competence and effort in their work.\n2. Co-worker A strives to do their best in their work.\n3. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.\n4. Co-worker A is known for being competent and is trusted with important projects.\n5. Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues.\n6. Co-worker A is seen as competent and reliable by Co-worker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a helpful context, albeit somewhat indirectly, for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The individual statements in the MEMORY describe positive perceptions and characteristics of Co-worker A, which supports the context where Co-worker A confidently declares themselves as the boss and wanting things to go smoothly. This acknowledgement by Co-worker B could be inferred as a support to Co-worker A's assertiveness in the dialogue. However, the MEMORY lacks specific details about past interactions or specific events between the co-workers that clearly illustrate causality or development of their working relationship. The sentences are generally structured and connected, but they are fairly generic affirmations of Co-worker A's competence and reliability without creating a narrative related directly to the current conversation. Thus, the MEMORY partially helps but could be more tailored and detailed to offer clearer connections and aid Unknown in generating the next response."
