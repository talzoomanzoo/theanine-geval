Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss! Co-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes. Co-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan. Co-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway. Co-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way. Co-workers B: And sometimes it is, but we all have different ideas and perspectives to bring to the table. Co-workers A: Okay, I see your point. I'll try to be more open-minded in the future.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues.\n2. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.\n3. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value communication and understanding in relationships.\n4. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's competence and effort in their work.\n5. Co-worker A strives to do their best in their work.\n6. Co-worker A and Co-worker B had a disagreement but resolved it, becoming friends again.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains information that could be helpful in generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not fully aligned with it. The context revolves around a specific interaction where Co-worker A needs to be more open-minded and acknowledges Co-worker B's perspective. The MEMORY provides some general information about their working relationship, such as their ability to resolve issues, work ethic, and shared values, which indirectly supports the idea of resolving disagreements. However, it lacks explicit details about the specific disagreement in the context or how exactly they resolved their past disagreement, which would directly aid in generating a response. The sentences in the MEMORY are also quite generic and don't provide a clear narrative or causality linking the MEMORY to the specific dialogue. While the MEMORY does suggest an overall positive working relationship, which could be relevant, it does not provide detailed insights into the specific context, limiting its helpfulness. "
