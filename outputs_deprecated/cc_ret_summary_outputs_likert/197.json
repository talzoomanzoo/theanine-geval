Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel really fulfilled as a leader and guide. Helping others gives me a sense of purpose. Co-workers B: I can see that. You always seem to know just what to do to make people feel better. Co-workers A: Yeah, I've had a lot of practice over the years. It's just something that comes naturally to me. Co-workers B: Do you remember that time when you were led to a safe place by the commander? You must have felt pretty grateful for his guidance then. Co-workers A: Absolutely. It was a really tough time and I was so relieved to have someone show me the way. I try to pay it forward by being that kind of leader for others. Co-workers B: That's a great attitude to have. Speaking of leadership, do you think you would ever want to take on a higher position in the company?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A had a positive experience with a commander who helped them feel safe.\n2. Co-worker B values finding fulfillment in work, pursuing hobbies, making a difference in the world, and building relationships with others.\n3. Co-worker A believes that making money can lead to fulfillment and provide the freedom to pursue hobbies and interests.\n4. Co-worker B emphasizes the importance of acknowledging privileges and using them to make the world a better place.\n5. Co-worker B offers encouragement and believes things will work out in the end.\n6. Co-worker A believes that everyone has the ability to create opportunities and make their own luck through hard work and seizing opportunities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've definitely considered it. I think it would be a great opportunity to make an even bigger impact and help more people feel supported and safe in their roles.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks a full connection to fully support the conversation. Sentence 1 is specifically helpful as it picks up on the experience Co-worker A had with the commander, which aligns with the conversation about leadership and guidance in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 2 and 3 give a broader sense of Co-worker B's values and Co-worker A's beliefs, which could add depth to understanding their perspectives, but they don't directly connect to the ongoing conversation about leadership and guidance. Sentences 4, 5, and 6 are less directly related to the dialogue context, focusing more on general concepts of privilege, encouragement, and self-made opportunities rather than the specific relationship dynamics present in the dialogue. Consequently, while some parts of the memory are helpful, others don't closely tie into the current direction of the conversation, which affects the overall helpfulness. Overall, the MEMORY provides a basis for generating a response, but it could be improved by including more directly relevant memory points linked to leadership, guidance, and career advancement."
