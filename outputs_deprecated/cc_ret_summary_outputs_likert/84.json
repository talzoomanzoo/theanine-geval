Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, have you checked out my new blog? It's all about promoting under-the-radar artists. Classmates B: I haven't had a chance to yet, but that sounds really cool! What inspired you to start it? Classmates A: Well, I've always had a passion for the arts, but I was too afraid to pursue it. I finally realized that it's what I really love, and I wanted to share that love with others.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A has been pursuing their passions and enjoying life.\n2. Classmates B encouraged Classmates A to step out of their comfort zone and try new things for personal growth.\n3. Classmates B supports Classmates A's perspective on living authentically and free from others' opinions.\n4. Classmates A ended up taking Classmates B's advice and found success with it.\n5. Both Classmates A and B value the importance of trying new things and taking risks for personal development.\n6. Classmates B expresses a desire to see Classmates A happy and successful in life.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's amazing to hear! I'm so glad to see you stepping out of your comfort zone and following your passion. Your blog sounds like a great way to promote artists who deserve more recognition. I can't wait to check it out and see all the amazing content you're creating.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information about the relationship and past interactions between Classmates A and B, which aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences in MEMORY reflect key dynamics and sentiments shared between the classmates, such as Classmates B's encouragement and support for Classmates A's pursuits (points 2, 3, and 4). This context—Classmates B's support and encouragement—helps Unknown to generate meaningful extensions or responses to the current dialogue about the blog and pursuing passions. Additionally, the MEMORY highlights shared values between the classmates (point 5), which provides a coherent backdrop and development of their friendship. While not every detail in MEMORY is directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, the MEMORIES are naturally phrased and provide a clear sense of the supportive dynamic between the classmates. Overall, MEMORY successfully offers crucial insight into their relationship that can be reflected in the language model's next response."
