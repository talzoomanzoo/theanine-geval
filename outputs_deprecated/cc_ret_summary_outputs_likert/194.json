Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel really fulfilled as a leader and guide. Helping others gives me a sense of purpose. Co-workers B: I can see that. You always seem to know just what to do to make people feel better. Co-workers A: Yeah, I've had a lot of practice over the years. It's just something that comes naturally to me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B values finding fulfillment in work, pursuing hobbies, making a difference in the world, and building relationships with others.\n2. Co-worker A had a positive experience with a commander who helped them feel safe.\n3. Co-worker A believes that making money can lead to fulfillment and provide the freedom to pursue hobbies and interests.\n4. Co-worker A believes that everyone has the ability to create opportunities and make their own luck through hard work and seizing opportunities.\n5. Co-worker B offers encouragement and believes things will work out in the end.\n6. Co-worker B emphasizes the importance of acknowledging privileges and using them to make the world a better place.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's such a valuable skill to have. I think your ability to make others feel safe and supported is truly special.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information that are somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, Co-worker A's belief in making money leading to fulfillment (memory 3) and their positive experience with a commander (memory 2) connect to their sense of fulfillment as a leader (described in the dialogue). Co-worker B's values and tendencies toward encouragement (memories 1 and 5) align with their supportive responses in the dialogue. However, the connection between MEMORY and DIALOGUE CONTEXT is not particularly strong or direct. Some of the details, like Co-worker B emphasizing privileges (memory 6), do not directly contribute to understanding the current dialogue exchange. Overall, MEMORY provides helpful context but lacks direct causality or development relevant to the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
