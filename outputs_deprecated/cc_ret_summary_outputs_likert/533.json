Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind? Classmates A: I know about your affair with that other woman.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A has developed a crush on Classmates B, which Classmates B finds flattering.\n2. Classmates A and B have a good relationship, with Classmates A expressing admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor.\n3. Classmates A suggests grabbing lunch together, showing an interest in spending more time with Classmates B.\n4. Both Classmates A and B enjoy talking to each other and consider themselves great study partners.\n5. Both Classmates A and B are open to exploring a romantic connection and are looking forward to getting to know each other better.\n6. Classmates A and B are interested in biology and studying cells.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I think there might be a misunderstanding. I don't have an affair with anyone. What makes you think that?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about the relationship between Classmates A and B, which may be helpful in understanding the dynamics of their conversation. It shows that Classmates A has a crush on B and admires their intelligence and humor. This can add layers to the understanding of the current dialogue where Classmates A is confronting Classmates B. The information that they have a good relationship and are open to exploring a romantic connection could be relevant to their current interaction around the topic of an affair.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY also includes information that is not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as their shared interest in biology and cells or them being study partners, and the fact that Classmates A finds Classmates B's interest in spending time together flattering is not critical to the understanding of the present exchange. Consequently, while the MEMORY contains relevant background information, it is interspersed with less pertinent details that do not aid directly in generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT effectively. Thus, the MEMORY earns a mid-level rating."
