    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway? Wife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go? Husband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband got impatient and excited about his plans, leading him to leave without the wife.\n2. The husband has long-awaited plans and is finally taking action on them.\n3. The wife supports the husband's goals but wanted to be involved in them.\n4. The husband apologized and promised to involve the wife in his plans in the future.\n5. The wife offers her support and encouragement to the husband in his journey towards achieving his dreams.\n6. The husband is inspired by his wife to take action on his dreams and goals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a wonderful idea! I can't wait to spend some quality time with you in the peaceful surroundings of nature.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT by establishing that the husband has plans and is inspired by his wife to take action on them. This adds context to the husband's proposal of a weekend getaway and indicates a pattern of his behavior - taking action on plans and valuing the wife's input. However, the MEMORY includes elements that are not directly relevant to the current context of planning a getaway (e.g., the husband's impatience and leaving without the wife), which could potentially distract the language model from generating the next response. The connections and development in MEMORY are somewhat present but not entirely clear or directly aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, warranting a mid-range score."
