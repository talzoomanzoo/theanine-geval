    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today? Classmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own. Classmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others. Classmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone. Classmates A: You're not a burden, don't worry. And I'm always here to help you out. Classmates B: I appreciate that, but I don't want to always rely on others. I want to be more independent. Classmates A: I get it. Maybe there are some small things you can do on your own to start feeling more independent? Classmates B: Like what?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as evidenced by their conversation about their respective experiences.\n2. Classmates B finds it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after a conversation they had about following dreams.\n3. Classmates A enjoys reminiscing about childhood memories, particularly about playing on swings and making music with friends.\n4. Classmates B is interested in learning to play an instrument.\n5. Classmates A and B are both keeping up with the homework in their math class.\n6. Classmates A and B enjoy jamming together and plan to collaborate on music in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but not all of it is directly relevant. The MEMORY includes details about Classmates A and B's relationship, such as their supportive dynamic (point 1), which aligns with the tone of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Classmates A offers help and reassurance. There is also a mention of Classmates B being interested in learning to play an instrument (point 4), which could be a potential small step for Classmates B to feel more independent, given their interest in music and the context of seeking independence. However, most other memories, like Classmates A's passion for music, memories of childhood, and mutual collaboration in music (points 2, 3, and 6), do not directly contribute to the conversation topic of fostering independence. Similarly, their shared math class engagement (point 5) does not connect directly to the context discussed. Despite these irrelevancies, the included information is phrased naturally, making it clear what is contextually relevant and what is not, warranting a moderate score."
