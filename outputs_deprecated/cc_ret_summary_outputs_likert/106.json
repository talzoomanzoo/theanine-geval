Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager! Co-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role. Co-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge. Co-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail. Co-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.

Co-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality. Co-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes.

Co-workers B: Exactly, and I'm sure you'll apply that same mentality to your training as well. I remember you were really dedicated to it a couple of years ago. Co-workers A: Oh yeah, I still try to keep up with it whenever I can. It's important to stay physically and mentally fit, especially with this new job. Co-workers B: Just don't let your anger get the better of you again. Remember when you exploded and started throwing things? Co-workers A: Ugh, let's not even go there. My parents gave me a good scolding for that. Co-workers B: Well, all that matters is that you learn from your mistakes and keep moving forward. And hey, you're doing just that with this promotion. Co-workers A: Absolutely. Thanks for always being a supportive colleague, it means a lot to me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader.\n2.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Co-worker A's aspirations and growth towards leadership, which aligns with the promotion news. However, the sentences in MEMORY are somewhat generic and not as detailed or naturally connected as they could be, leading to a lack of clear development or causality that enriches the dialogue context. More precise references to specific interactions or experiences shared in the dialogue, such as Co-worker A's previous stress or training dedication, could improve its helpfulness. Thus, MEMORY provides a moderately helpful foundation but lacks some depth and natural narrative flow."
