Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nAthlete: Ted Athlete unrolls the map. He looks at it for a few moments before tracing his finger along one of the highways. \"This is our route,\" he says finally, feeling in control. Coach: What route are you planning, Ted? Athlete: I'm thinking of taking the highway through the mountains, it's a bit longer, but the scenery is beautiful.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Coach is giving advice to the Athlete regarding their performance and focus.\n2. The Athlete is focused on helping the team succeed and has shown leadership qualities during warm-ups and stretches.\n3. The Athlete decides to tough it out and stay focused on the game.\n4. The Athlete seeks approval and praise from the Coach.\n5. The Coach has noticed the Athlete's improvement and dedication to improving skills.\n6. The coach advises the athlete on pre-game meals, emphasizing the need for a balance of carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats, as well as staying hydrated.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the coach giving advice and the athlete showing leadership qualities. However, these details are very general and do not have a direct connection to the specific context of discussing a route for a journey. The sentences mainly focus on the athlete's performance and the coach's advice regarding sports-related matters, which is not particularly helpful for generating a response about planning a travel route. The structure of the MEMORY lacks clear development or causality related to the travel topic discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it less helpful for generating a relevant next response."
