Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn. Teacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The teacher and student have a positive and understanding relationship.\n2. The student felt rewarded by the experience and emphasized the importance of being aware of surroundings and acting quickly in emergencies.\n3. The student mentioned feeling stressed lately, which may have led to the outburst.\n4. The student once saved a kid from drowning and had a moment of yelling at the teacher in the past.\n5. The teacher expressed understanding and encouraged the student to seek help when needed.\n6. The teacher praised the student for their bravery and quick action in the emergency situation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, I do! It's like a little thrill in every bite. It's kind of like the rush I felt when I saved that kid from drowning. Speaking of which, thank you for always being understanding and supportive, especially during my outbursts.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some potentially relevant information about the student and teacher's past interactions, such as their positive relationship and past instances where the student acted bravely and was stressed. These could be helpful in understanding the student's personality and the teacher's supportive behavior. However, the details like the emergency situation or previous outbursts are not easily connected to the current dialogue about hot sauce. While MEMORY shows some development of the relationship between the student and teacher, it doesn't explicitly enhance the context about the discussion on hot sauce or enjoying spicy sensations. The sentences are naturally structured, though they offer limited direct relevance to the current topic being discussed, making it moderately helpful."
