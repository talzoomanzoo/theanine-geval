Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend! Co-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n2. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together.\n3. Co-worker A is observant and did some research on social media to find out that Co-worker B is married.\n4. Co-worker B is married and had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends.\n5. Co-worker A and Co-worker B used to work together at a clothing store.\n6. Co-worker A and Co-worker B were able to pay their bills on time when working at the clothing store.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some background information about Co-worker A and B that could potentially be useful to a language model for understanding their past interactions, such as them working together at a clothing store and sharing happy memories. However, many of the sentences in MEMORY do not directly connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Co-worker A singing a solo at church. Additionally, the specific details about their past interactions, such as Co-worker B's surprise at Co-worker A's uncovering of their marital status and the weekend activities, appear random and don't directly contribute to generating the next appropriate response in the given dialogue. As a result, while there are some contextually relevant elements, the overall MEMORY lacks strong coherence and direct relevance to the immediate dialogue context. Thus, it only minimally provides helpful information, warranting a score of 2."
