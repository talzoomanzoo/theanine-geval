Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A suggests grabbing lunch together, showing an interest in spending more time with Classmates B.\n2. Classmates A and B have a good relationship, with Classmates A expressing admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor.\n3. Both Classmates A and B enjoy talking to each other and consider themselves great study partners.\n4. Classmates A and B are interested in biology and studying cells.\n5. Classmates A finds it refreshing to talk to someone genuinely interested in science and learning.\n6. Classmates A has developed a crush on Classmates B, which Classmates B finds flattering.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several pieces of relevant information that can be beneficial in generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 2, and 3 show that Classmates A is interested in spending more time with Classmates B, admires B's intelligence and humor, and they both enjoy each other's company, which is useful for understanding the dynamics of their relationship. Sentence 6 is particularly relevant because Classmates A needs to talk about something important, which may relate to their crush on Classmates B. Sentences 4 and 5 add additional context about their shared interest in biology and science, which though it might not directly relate to the immediate conversation, helps to contextualize their relationship and common interests. Overall, the MEMORY is informative and relevant to understanding the possible nuances behind Classmates A's intent to have an important conversation."
