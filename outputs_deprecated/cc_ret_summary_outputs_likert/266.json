Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful. Co-workers B: Did you make sure to include all the necessary details? Co-workers A: Yes, I made sure to cover everything we talked about in the meeting. I even added some extra information that I thought could be useful. Co-workers B: That's smart thinking. It shows that you're invested in the company and want to make sure things run smoothly. Co-workers A: Thanks. I learned a lot from taking over the family business. It taught me the importance of being efficient and proactive. Co-workers B: I remember you telling me about that. It's amazing how much you've accomplished since then. Co-workers A: It's been a journey, but I'm glad to see the business flourishing. It gives me a sense of pride and accomplishment.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A took over their family's business a few years ago and it has improved since then.\n2. Co-worker A has a family business that has been doing well recently.\n3. Co-worker A took over the family business and made changes to adapt to modern times.\n4. Co-worker A's father was hesitant to hand over the business but now trusts Co-worker A.\n5. Co-worker B appreciates the pen and thanks Co-worker A for the gesture.\n6. Co-worker A made changes to modernize processes and invest in new technology for the business.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides crucial background about Co-worker A since they took over the family business, which is mentioned in the conversation. Specifically, sentences 1, 3, and 6 are directly related to aspects discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Co-worker A's proactive approach and the business's success. Sentence 4 provides additional context regarding the transfer of the business from Co-worker A's father, which enhances the understanding of the current situation. While sentence 5 is unrelated to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it is structured clearly, making it easy to discern its irrelevance. Overall, the information is structured in a connected manner and is helpful for generating a thoughtful continuation based on the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
