Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become? Neighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A noticed some wood near their backyard and asked Neighbor B if they had seen it too.\n2. Neighbors B appreciates Neighbors A's handy skills.\n3. Neighbor A values their friendship with Neighbor B and wants to ensure it remains strong.\n4. Neighbors B offers help and support to Neighbors A in the situation.\n5. Neighbors A and B are observing wood that appears to be freshly cut from a tree.\n6. Neighbors A and B discuss the possibility of someone in the neighborhood using the wood for a project.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY does include some information that could potentially aid the language model in generating a relevant response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the mention of Neighbor A's handy skills and the appreciation from Neighbor B (MEMORY sentence 2), which may relate to Neighbor A's newfound strength. However, overall, the MEMORY focuses more on unrelated elements like the wood incident (sentences 1, 5, and 6) and Neighbor Aâ€™s desire to maintain a strong friendship (sentence 3), which do not directly contribute to understanding the current dialogue about strength and working out. While the MEMORY provides some context about the relationship between the neighbors, most sentences lack direct relevance to the current situation and their structure does not adequately emphasize past interactions or causality related to the context. Therefore, the helpfulness of MEMORY in generating a proper response to the conversation is limited."
