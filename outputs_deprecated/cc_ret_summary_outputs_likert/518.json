Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. Neighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off. Neighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks? Neighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else. Neighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location? Neighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home. Neighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become. Neighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice. Neighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along?  Neighbors A: It's finished! Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. It was a lot of work, but worth it in the end.  Neighbors B: That's amazing, thanks for building me such a beautiful house.  Neighbors A: Of course, I'm glad you like it. Remember when we watched the sunset over the London skyline? That was such a beautiful moment. Neighbors B: Yes, I still remember the pink and orange hues reflecting off the buildings. It was breathtaking.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A helped Neighbors B build a new house with amazing features.\n2. Neighbor B reminds Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them.\n3. Neighbors B is enjoying the sunset from their new backyard, expressing gratitude towards Neighbors A.\n4. Neighbor B is looking forward to seeing the finished house and is excited about the new project.\n5. Neighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly.\n6. Neighbor A and Neighbor B discuss organizing a community event to make a positive impact and appreciate the beauty of their city.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I still can't get over how stunning that sunset was. It's moments like that which remind me why I love living in this city.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks cohesive structure and natural phrasing to make it highly helpful. Sentences 1, 2, and 3 are somewhat relevant as they relate to the discussion about the completed house. Sentence 1 accurately reflects Neighbors A's contribution to B's house, but Sentence 2 is slightly off as it implies a reminder of potential, which is not explicit in the context. Sentence 3 captures the imagery from the dialogue's final exchange. However, the remaining sentences, particularly 4 and 6, do not reflect past interactions relevant to the provided context. Sentence 4 incorrectly suggests Neighbor B is looking forward to the house project, which conflicts with it being completed, while Sentence 6 introduces new information about a community event that doesn't appear in the dialogue. The memory could be improved by ensuring all sentences are accurate and directly related to the context, and by enhancing the coherence and richness of the development of events between the two speakers."
