Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn. Teacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation? Student: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle. Teacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The teacher and student have a positive and understanding relationship.\n2. The student mentioned feeling stressed lately, which may have led to the outburst.\n3. The teacher expressed understanding and encouraged the student to seek help when needed.\n4. The student felt rewarded by the experience and emphasized the importance of being aware of surroundings and acting quickly in emergencies.\n5. The student apologizes to the teacher for yelling in the hallway, acknowledging it was out of character and seeking to move past it.\n6. The student once saved a kid from drowning and had a moment of yelling at the teacher in the past.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information that could potentially aid in understanding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the acknowledgment of a positive and understanding relationship between the teacher and student. However, most of the sentences in the MEMORY revolve around a past incident unrelated to the current dialogue about hot sauce and tolerance to spicy foods. The references to stress, an outburst, and an apology for yelling are disconnected from the ongoing discussion, which affects the relevancy and helpfulness of the MEMORY in generating a coherent next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences do not form a clearly demonstrated connection or causality relevant to the present interaction, thus hindering the language model's ability to respond appropriately."
