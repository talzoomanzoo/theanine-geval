Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. Neighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off. Neighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks? Neighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else. Neighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location? Neighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home. Neighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become. Neighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice. Neighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along?  Neighbors A: It's finished! Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. It was a lot of work, but worth it in the end.  Neighbors B: That's amazing, thanks for building me such a beautiful house. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A helped Neighbors B build a new house with amazing features.\n2. Neighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly.\n3. Neighbor B reminds Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them.\n4. Neighbors A found building the new house challenging but rewarding.\n5. Neighbor B is looking forward to seeing the finished house and is excited about the new project.\n6. Neighbor A is building a new house for Neighbor B with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that could help a language model generate a proper next response based on the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences in MEMORY, such as how Neighbors A helped Neighbors B build a new house, the features of the house (three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard), and Neighbors B's appreciation and excitement about the house, provide contextually rich information that aligns with the dialogue about completing projects and the house building progress mentioned in the dialogue context.\n\nHowever, sentences 2 and 3, which discuss Neighbor A's enjoyment in building houses quickly and Neighbor B reminding them of their potential, are somewhat less relevant given the dialogue's immediate context involving addressing procrastination. Despite this, the overall coherence and development of sentences in MEMORY reveal past interactions between the neighbors, making it fairly helpful for response generation even if some nuances might not be directly connected to the immediate dialogue. Overall, the MEMORY is structured well and relates to the dialogue context, aiding in understanding the relationship between the two speakers."
