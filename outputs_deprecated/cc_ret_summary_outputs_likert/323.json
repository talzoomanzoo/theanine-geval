    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway? Wife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go? Husband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city. Wife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change. Husband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think? Wife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it. Husband: Great. I'll start looking for rental cabins right away. I know this may sound impulsive, but I'm really excited to make this happen. Wife: Don't worry, husband, it's not impulsive. You always follow through with your plans, and I believe this will be a wonderful experience for both of us. Husband: Thank you, wife. And, I want to apologize for the time I left without waiting for you. I know I promised to wait, and I should have kept my word. Wife: It's okay, husband. I understand that you were in a hurry, and it wasn't intentional. Besides, that was a long time ago, and we've moved past it. Husband: Thank you for being so understanding, wife. I just want to make sure I am not repeating the same mistake again. Wife: I trust that you won't, husband. And hey, remember when I stopped a runaway carriage from causing harm to a group of people? That was quite the adrenaline rush! Husband: Oh, I remember that, wife. You are fearless, and I'm so proud of you. Wife: Thanks, husband. And speaking of good times, I had so much fun at the dance a few weeks ago. Dancing with you always puts me in a good mood. Husband: Same here, wife. I love spending time with you, and I feel grateful for every moment we get to share.  Wife: I feel the same way, husband. And, I appreciate you doing the dishes for me today so we could have this conversation.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The wife reassures the husband of her continuous support and belief in him.\n2. The husband apologized and promised to involve the wife in his plans in the future.\n3. The husband is inspired by his wife to take action on his dreams and goals.\n4. The husband and wife are committed to each other and excited about their future together.\n5. The husband values the wife's encouragement and positivity in his pursuit of his goals.\n6. The wife offers her support and encouragement to the husband in his journey towards achieving his dreams.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a general overview of the dynamics between the husband and wife, focusing on mutual support, encouragement, and commitment. While these sentiments are evident in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, the MEMORY lacks specificity and detail that would make it more directly helpful for a language model tasked with generating a follow-up response. Certain elements like past events (e.g., the husband's apology, a past promise, dancing, or the wife's story about stopping a runaway carriage) that are mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT are absent in the MEMORY. Including these details would better assist in capturing the nuances of the dialogue context for a more tailored response generation. Overall, though the MEMORY offers valuable insights into the relationship dynamics, it could be improved with more specific recounting of past interactions to enhance its direct relevance and helpfulness."
