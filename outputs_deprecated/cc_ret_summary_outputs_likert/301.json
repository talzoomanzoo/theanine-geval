Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to share something with you. I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend. Classmates B: That's really kind of you. What did you do to help?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B has been supportive and helpful to Classmates A.\n2. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support.\n3. Classmates A appreciates the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n4. Classmates B handled a previous mix-up with the class schedule well, showing responsibility and reliability.\n5. Classmates A and B started as acquaintances and have developed a strong friendship.\n6. Classmates A and B are making plans to spend time together outside of school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I made them dinner and ran some errands for them. It felt good to be able to lend a helping hand.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers some helpful context about the relationship between Classmates A and B. Specifically, sentences 1, 2, 3, and 5 highlight the supportive and appreciative dynamic between the two, which is relevant as Classmates A shares an act of kindness with Classmates B. This background information can help a language model understand the context of their friendly and supportive relationship, which is important for generating an appropriate next response. \n\nHowever, sentences 4 and 6 are less directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 4 talks about Classmates B handling a class schedule mix-up, and sentence 6 mentions plans to spend time together outside of school. While they offer some insights into Classmates B's character and their friendship, they don't directly relate to the current conversation about helping a neighbor. \n\nOverall, the MEMORY could be more connected to the specific context of helping a neighbor, but it does provide a useful understanding of the general relationship between the classmates."
