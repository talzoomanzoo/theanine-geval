Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today. Wife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that. Husband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you. Wife: You always go above and beyond, dear. Husband: It's the little things that count, right? Wife: Definitely. Speaking of little things, do you remember when you told me about catching the bus just in time a few months ago?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband appreciates the little things in life, such as making it to the bus on time.\n2. Both the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful.\n3. The husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that make him happy outside of work and family life.\n4. The wife mentions that the husband had to run to catch the bus a couple of years ago.\n5. The wife is glad to see the husband finding a sense of purpose and being happy.\n6. Husband values the supportive community of believers at church and appreciates having his wife by his side.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Oh yes, I remember that day! It was such a rush, but I made it. It's amazing how those small victories can make a difference in how the rest of the day goes.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures the theme of appreciating small things in life (as mentioned by the wife regarding the bus story), which aligns well with the context discussing coziness and efforts to create a comforting space. Points 1 and 2 in MEMORY signify the importance of little things, directly echoing the sentiment in DIALOGUE CONTEXT and allowing the language model to continue on this theme. \n\nPoint 4 specifically references the wife's mention of the husband catching the bus, which is directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and provides continuity for the conversation. Point 3, while not directly related, still offers insight into the supportive nature of their relationship, which can be relevant in generating a cohesive next response. Points 5 and 6, although slightly off-topic, are phrased in a way that makes it easy to identify them as broader contextual information about the husband's life and values.\n\nOverall, most sentences align well with the current conversation, spotlighting the importance of appreciating life's little moments and mutual support, making the MEMORY quite helpful for response generation."
