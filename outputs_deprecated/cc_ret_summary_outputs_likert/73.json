Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on. Child: What is it, Parent? Parent: I created a website where I post advertisements, and people can pay to see them. Child: Oh, that's interesting. How does it work? Parent: Well, I create the ads myself, and then I post them on my website. People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them. Child: Do you think people will pay to see your ads?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Child is caring and offers help to the Parent.\n2. The Child supports the idea of the Parent adopting more children and hopes for a happy home for them.\n3. The parent and child have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores.\n4. The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings.\n5. The Parent is working and feels tired after a long day.\n6. The Parent expresses a desire to adopt more children in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided offers a glimpse into the relationship between the Parent and Child, highlighting their open communication, care, and support for each other. However, much of the MEMORY is not directly related or helpful for generating a response to the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT provided. While it does elaborate on the Parent's role and aspirations, it doesn't provide information specific to the Parent's new project of creating and monetizing a website through ads, or the Childâ€™s interest and reaction to it. Sentences 1, 3, and 4 provide general context on the Parent-Child relationship but do not aid directly in contextually advancing the current conversation about the project. Sentence 6 touches on adoption, which is not relevant to creating a response in the current dialogue context. Hence, while there are some useful insights into the relationship, most of the MEMORY does not directly contribute to generating a response to the dialogue at hand."
