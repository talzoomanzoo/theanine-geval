    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together. Neighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left? Neighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him. Neighbors B: That's not true, Neighbor A. You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are. Neighbors A: I just feel so lost right now. I don't know how to move on from this. Neighbors B: It's going to take time, but you will get through this. Do you want to talk about how you're feeling or do something to take your mind off of things?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A appreciates the emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during their time of grief.\n2. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n3. Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.\n4. Neighbor A finds solace in nature and believes that it helps in coping with their emotions.\n5. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have a close friendship and have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n6. Neighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Neighbor B providing support to Neighbor A during a difficult time. This is somewhat aligned with the current context where Neighbor B is offering emotional support to Neighbor A. However, other parts of the MEMORY, such as the mention of the grandmother's passing and moving to a new neighborhood, aren't directly relevant to the current dialogue related to a breakup or feelings of not being enough. Additionally, the information about finding solace in nature or their shared memories in the park is not directly applicable to the immediate context. Overall, while MEMORY captures some elements of support and companionship, it lacks strong coherence with the specific concern of Neighbor A's breakup situation. The information is not well-structured to clearly demonstrate the development or connection of events relevant to the current interaction, reducing its overall usefulness for generating a next response."
