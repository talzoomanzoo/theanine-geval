Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today? Co-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there? Co-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done. Co-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded. Co-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out. Co-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends? Co-workers A: Ugh, don't remind me. That was such a disaster. Co-workers B: It was definitely not one of your finest moments. But it's good to see that you're being responsible now and taking care of things like sending packages. Co-workers A: Thanks. I'm trying to be more responsible and reliable these days. Co-workers B: That's great to hear. It reminds me of the time when you were a great leader in your country. You were strong, determined, and made a positive impact.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B is supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable.\n2. Co-worker A was a leader in their country, making it prosperous and safe.\n3. Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides.\n4. Both co-workers show a supportive and caring attitude towards each other.\n5. Co-worker A is trying to improve their punctuality and cut back on drinking.\n6. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to give people a chance.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided offers a helpful context for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Several elements in the MEMORY align with the current conversation, such as Co-worker B being supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to become more responsible (mention in sentence 1), Co-worker A's leadership qualities (mention in sentence 2), and the supportive and caring communication between both co-workers (mention in sentence 4). These aspects are relevant to the discussion happening in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding responsibility and past experiences. However, while some sentences are directly relevant, others provide ancillary information (such as trying to improve punctuality and cut back on drinking or encouraging Co-worker A to give people a chance) that, while naturally phrased, do not directly relate to the ongoing dialogue about sending packages or past personal experiences driving change. Overall, the sentences show clear connections and relevance to each other and support the language model in crafting responses, hence the score of 4."
