Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly. Neighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit? Neighbors A: It was Chicago. I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations. Neighbors B: I bet it was a nice change of scenery from our neighborhood. Neighbors A: Definitely. But you know, it's interesting how much our neighborhood has grown on me over the years. I remember when I first moved here, I was so unsure about it. Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember. But you stayed because you wanted to be here. Neighbors A: That's right. And since then, I've made so many great memories here. It's become my home. Neighbors B: And you're still spending time with God every day, right?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A enjoys living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbor A has been living in the same place for a long time and enjoys the neighborhood and people there.\n3. Neighbors B has been living in the neighborhood for some time and is supportive of Neighbors A.\n4. Neighbors A finds spending time with God brings them peace and happiness.\n5. Neighbors A is excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends.\n6. Neighbors A and B live in the same place and find comfort in it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, spending time with God brings me so much peace and happiness. It's a daily routine that helps me stay grounded and grateful for everything in my life.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Neighbors A's enjoyment of living in the neighborhood and Neighbors A's relationship with Neighbors B, which is supportive. It also mentions that Neighbors A finds comfort and happiness in spending time with God, linking to the last question posed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences capture the development of Neighbors A's feelings about the neighborhood and demonstrate why they have grown fond of it, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT's theme of change in perception over time. While some sentences such as the interest in exploring the neighborhood do not directly tie into the present conversation, overall, the MEMORY is structured well enough for the model to identify and utilize key elements for generating a relevant response."
