    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I know you know something about my past. Can you tell me what it is? Classmates B: I'm sorry,, but I can't disclose that information. It's not my place to tell. Classmates A: But how did you find out? I haven't told anyone. Classmates B: Let's just say I have my ways of finding out things. But don't worry,, it's nothing bad or embarrassing. Classmates A: Okay, but it's still bothering me that you know something about me that even my closest friends don't know.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B warns Classmates A about the potential danger of dark alleys.\n2. Classmates A is curious and open to exploring new things and taking risks.\n3. Classmates A encountered a mysterious woman in a dark alley, finding her intriguing.\n4. Classmates B advises Classmates A to be careful and aware while on the bus.\n5. Classmates A was nervous about fitting in but saw Classmates B as well-liked and wanted to be friends with them.\n6. Classmates A and B became friends when Classmates A transferred to the school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I understand why you might feel that way, but please trust that I have good intentions. Sometimes information just comes my way, and I don't mean any harm by knowing. I value our friendship and would never use any information against you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful contextual information about the history between Classmates A and B, which can help the language model generate a coherent and contextually appropriate response. Specifically, memories 2, 5, and 6 highlight Classmates A's personality traits and the development of their friendship with Classmates B, which could be relevant for understanding their current dynamic. However, the other memories about dark alleys and bus safety seem less directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT of Classmates A being concerned about Classmates B knowing something about their past. The sentences are well-structured and naturally phrased but don't all clearly demonstrate a direct connection to the dialogue context. Thus, while there is helpful information, it's not entirely focused on the current dialogue, leading to a score that sits in the middle."
