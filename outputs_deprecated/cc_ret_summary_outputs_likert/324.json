Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A is stranded in space, running out of oxygen and feeling lightheaded.\n2. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during the difficult situation.\n3. Classmates B praised Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n4. Classmate B admires Classmate A's attitude and sees it as a good example for others.\n5. Classmates A helped Classmates B out of friendship and believes in supporting each other.\n6. Classmates A and B have been on field trips to other planets or moons before, like Mars.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "No, I think I'm just a little flushed from all the excitement of our adventure on Mars last week. It was quite the experience, wasn't it?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided is largely irrelevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is focused on a physical condition (\"red and splotchy face\") possibly due to sunburn, the MEMORY pertains to a completely unrelated scenario of Classmates A and B being in space and exhibiting traits like resilience and gratitude. There is no logical or contextual connection between the red and splotchy face and the experiences described in MEMORY. Additionally, the past interactions described in MEMORY are not naturally structured in a way that would clarify or enhance understanding of the current dialogue context. Overall, the MEMORY does not offer helpful information that the language model could use to generate an appropriate response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
