Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I really enjoy being a carpenter. It's a very fulfilling job. Classmates B: That's great to hear! How did you get into carpentry? Classmates A: My dad was a carpenter, so I grew up around it. I started by helping him out when I was young, and then I began to really enjoy it myself. Classmates B: That's awesome that you were able to learn from your dad and turn it into a career. Have you done any big projects lately? Classmates A: Yeah, I just finished building a custom bookshelf for a client. It was a challenging project, but I'm really happy with how it turned out.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate B is supportive and encourages Classmate A to pursue their dream.\n2. Classmates A is attending a seminar on starting a business and is excited about applying that knowledge to future plans.\n3. Classmates B is supportive and encourages Classmates A in their business venture.\n4. Classmates A has had a business idea for a while and is now taking steps to make it a reality.\n5. Classmates A appreciates the support and encouragement from Classmates B.\n6. Classmate B offers to support and potentially collaborate with Classmate A in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's so impressive! Your attention to detail really shows in your work. If you ever need a hand with any future projects, I'd love to help out or collaborate with you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides an overall supportive and encouraging perspective from Classmate B towards Classmate A, which aligns with the dialogue context where Classmate B shows interest and appreciation for Classmate A's carpentry skills and projects. However, the MEMORY primarily focuses on business-related goals and initiatives, while the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is centered around carpentry. Although the themes of support and encouragement are relevant, the specific context of business doesn't directly relate to the dialogue about carpentry. Therefore, while MEMORY informs about the nature of the relationship and encouragement, it only somewhat supports generating a precise continuation directly related to carpentry. Elements like support and collaboration in the future are relevant but are not directly aligned with the dialogue's immediate context."
