Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager! Co-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n2. Co-worker B acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress.\n3. Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader.\n4. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader.\n5. Co-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication.\n6. Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for understanding the dialogue context. The statements reveal that Co-worker A has aspirations of becoming a leader, has grown more confident, and values communication. This background information supports Co-worker B's congratulatory response to Co-worker A's promotion, which is described as a significant step forward in the dialogue. Co-worker B's encouragement and acknowledgment of Co-worker A's potential for leadership is also mentioned, which aligns with their supportive response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, the MEMORY provides useful context that could inform a language model's generation of appropriate future responses. However, while the content is relevant, it lacks specific instances or detailed past interactions between the co-workers that could have enhanced clarity in the relationship development."
