Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that. Neighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset? Neighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore. Neighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\n2. Neighbors A and B are helpful towards each other.\n3. Neighbors B recalls when Neighbors A helped with their lawn, showing mutual support between them.\n4. Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received.\n5. Neighbors A wants to rearrange their living room and Neighbors B has experience with rearranging furniture.\n6. Neighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship as neighbors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information that can be helpful in generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n- Sentence 1 (\"Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake\") and Sentence 2 (\"Neighbors A and B are helpful towards each other\") are relevant because they reinforce the supportive and understanding nature of Neighbors B, which aligns with Neighbors B's reaction in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\n- Sentence 3 (\"Neighbors B recalls when Neighbors A helped with their lawn, showing mutual support between them\") further elaborates on the mutual support, which aligns well with the supportive nature demonstrated in the dialogue.\n\n- Sentence 4 and Sentence 5 (gratitude for help and rearranging furniture) indicate that Neighbors A values appreciation and that Neighbors B has experience offering practical help, which could relate to providing advice about dealing with the boss.\n\n- Sentence 6 (\"Neighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship\") summarizes the interaction style and supports the context of the dialogue.\n\nHowever, not all of the recalled memories are immediately relevant to the specific issue (about the work situation and the boss) discussed in the context, thus the score is not a 5. But the useful connections and supportive interactions are clearly established, contributing significantly to the continuity and helpfulness for the dialogue flow."
