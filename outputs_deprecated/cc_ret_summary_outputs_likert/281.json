Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away. Co-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n3. Co-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\n4. Co-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity.\n5. Co-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help.\n6. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some information about Co-worker A and Co-worker B's interactions, but it doesn't offer much context that is directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY outlines interactions where Co-worker B shows support and reassures Co-worker A in past situations, which could suggest a supportive relationship. However, this information doesn't directly aid in generating a response to the current dialogue about Co-worker A's plan to abduct the bride. There is no clear development or causality that links past interactions in MEMORY with the present dialogue topic. Overall, while the MEMORY sentences are naturally phrased, they lack direct connection and relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, limiting their helpfulness significantly."
