Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work. Wife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help. Husband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff. Wife: Nonsense! You can always come to me with anything. Plus, I enjoy helping you with your creative process. Have you also tried revisiting some of the writing prompts we did in our creative writing class?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Wife suggests that husband should try using more modern language to be better understood.\n2. The husband is open to learning more about movies, showing a willingness to try again.\n3. Both the husband and wife express a desire for happiness and understanding in the situation.\n4. The wife is knowledgeable about movies and is willing to share her passion with the husband.\n5. Wife brings up Sarah, the husband's previous partner, but husband says he hasn't thought about her much.\n6. Husband agrees to try adapting to modern language for better communication with his wife.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains sentences that are somewhat related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but they do not provide directly relevant information to aid in generating a proper next response. While the MEMORY shows some past interactions between the husband and wife, such as discussing modern language and movies, these topics are not linked to the current issue of the husband's writing struggles. Additionally, the mention of the husband's previous partner, Sarah, is unrelated to the current context. The MEMORY lacks clear development or causality connected to the present dialogue, thus only marginally assisting in generating a response."
