Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway? Wife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go? Husband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city. Wife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change. Husband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think? Wife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it. Husband: Great. I'll start looking for rental cabins right away. I know this may sound impulsive, but I'm really excited to make this happen. Wife: Don't worry, husband, it's not impulsive. You always follow through with your plans, and I believe this will be a wonderful experience for both of us.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband has long-awaited plans and is finally taking action on them.\n2. The husband is excited about his progress on long-awaited plans and is putting in a lot of effort to make them a reality.\n3. The husband is inspired by his wife to take action on his dreams and goals.\n4. The husband apologized and promised to involve the wife in his plans in the future.\n5. The husband got impatient and excited about his plans, leading him to leave without the wife.\n6. The wife offers her support and encouragement to the husband in his journey towards achieving his dreams.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant contextual information that may be helpful in generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 2, and 4 directly relate to the context by mentioning the husband's plans and his tendency to follow through, echoing the dialogue where the husband plans for a getaway and the wife's trust in him doing so. Sentence 6 generally aligns with the wife's supportive attitude seen in the dialogue contexto. However, sentences 3 and 5 introduce past interactions where the husband is inspired by the wife and acts impulsively, respectively. These actions were not directly referenced in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, showing a less direct relevance to the ongoing conversation. Due to these mixed levels of relevancy and the fact that some MEMORY sentences don't seem to be significant for the current dialogue, the score should be a 3. Overall, MEMORY offers some useful insights but lacks clarity in its structure and comprehensive connection to the conversation at hand."
