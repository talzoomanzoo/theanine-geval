Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel really fulfilled as a leader and guide. Helping others gives me a sense of purpose. Co-workers B: I can see that. You always seem to know just what to do to make people feel better.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B values finding fulfillment in work, pursuing hobbies, making a difference in the world, and building relationships with others.\n2. Co-worker A had a positive experience with a commander who helped them feel safe.\n3. Co-worker A believes that making money can lead to fulfillment and provide the freedom to pursue hobbies and interests.\n4. Co-worker B offers encouragement and believes things will work out in the end.\n5. Co-worker B emphasizes the importance of acknowledging privileges and using them to make the world a better place.\n6. Co-worker A believes that everyone has the ability to create opportunities and make their own luck through hard work and seizing opportunities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe provided MEMORY contains some helpful information that can assist in generating a relevant response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but also includes sentences that are not directly connected or relevant to the given context. Specifically, sentences 1, 3, and 6 offer insights into Co-worker A's and Co-worker B's beliefs and values, which can be beneficial when responding to the dialogue context that touches upon fulfillment and making others feel better. However, sentences 2, 4, and 5, while informative about the co-workers' past interactions and values, do not provide direct context or causality related to their immediate dialogue about leadership and fulfillment. The memory provides a somewhat coherent picture of the attitudes and perspectives of both individuals, which can be useful, but does not fully align or closely connect with the current dialogue exchange. Thus, the helpfulness of the memory in generating a relevant response can be considered moderate."
