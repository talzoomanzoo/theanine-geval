Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn. Teacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation? Student: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle. Teacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time? Student: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then. Teacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going? Student: It's going pretty well. I started with French, but now I'm considering taking up Spanish and German too. I want to become more well-rounded. Teacher: That's a great goal. Have you thought about any specific ways you could use your language skills? Student: I would love to be able to travel more and speak with the locals in their native language. Maybe I could even teach my grandchildren some basic phrases.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The student is studying French at college and plans on learning Spanish and German as well.\n2. The teacher speaks Spanish and French fluently.\n3. The student has already made plans with their daughter and son-in-law to visit more often and take the grandkids on trips.\n4. The teacher and student have a positive and understanding relationship.\n5. The student believes in the importance of continuous learning and growth.\n6. The student expresses excitement about retiring and spending time with their grandkids, already planning fun activities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a wonderful plan! I'm sure your grandkids would love learning some phrases in different languages from you. It's great that you're focused on continuous learning and growth, even in retirement.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides information that is helpful for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY includes relevant details about the student's language learning goals (point 1) and their desire to use those skills for traveling and teaching their grandchildren (point 3 and 6), which are directly connected to the ongoing conversation about language learning. It also notes the studentâ€™s belief in continuous learning (point 5), aligning with their goal of becoming more well-rounded. Additionally, the MEMORY indicates the positive relationship between the teacher and the student (point 4), which is reflected in the supportive dialogue. Even though the MEMORY mentions the teacher's language skills (point 2), which is indirectly related, it still provides context relevant to language learning discussions. Overall, the memory is well-structured, clearly demonstrating the development and relevancy of the student and teacher's interactions, enhancing the understanding of the dialogue context."
