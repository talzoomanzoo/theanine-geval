Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, have you checked out my new blog? It's all about promoting under-the-radar artists. Classmates B: I haven't had a chance to yet, but that sounds really cool! What inspired you to start it? Classmates A: Well, I've always had a passion for the arts, but I was too afraid to pursue it. I finally realized that it's what I really love, and I wanted to share that love with others. Classmates B: That's amazing. It takes a lot of courage to pursue your passions like that. Classmates A: Yeah, it was scary at first, but the response has been really positive. I'm so glad I finally decided to take the leap. Classmates B: I'm proud of you. It's always great to see someone following their dreams. Classmates A: Thanks, it's been a journey, but I'm really happy with where I am now. It's crazy to think that years ago, I was so hesitant to even share this part of myself. Classmates B: It just goes to show that it's never too late to start pursuing what you love. Remember when we talked about you living your life on your own terms? You're doing just that.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A has been pursuing their passions and enjoying life.\n2. Classmates B encouraged Classmates A to step out of their comfort zone and try new things for personal growth.\n3. Classmates B supports Classmates A's perspective on living authentically and free from others' opinions.\n4. Both Classmates A and B value the importance of trying new things and taking risks for personal development.\n5. Classmates A ended up taking Classmates B's advice and found success with it.\n6. Classmates B expresses a desire to see Classmates A happy and successful in life.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I really appreciate your support and encouragement all this time. It means a lot to me. Thank you for believing in me and pushing me to step out of my comfort zone.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides a comprehensive overview of the important interactions and emotional support exchanged between Classmates A and B, which are pertinent to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences clearly highlight the encouragement from Classmates B and how Classmates A took that advice, achieved success, and focused on authentic self-expression. This aligns well with the dialogue, which centers around Classmates A's journey of overcoming fear and courageously pursuing his passion for promoting artists. Each sentence is naturally structured and maintains clear causality and connection. This makes it highly helpful for a language model, assisting in generating relevant responses that build on previous conversations and incorporate emotional and motivational support that's essential in the current context. Thus, a score of 5 is appropriate."
