Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message. Co-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident. Co-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows. Co-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive. Co-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right. Co-workers B: Speaking of convincing people, have you ever been in a physical altercation before? Co-workers A: Yes, unfortunately. But that doesn't mean I'm a danger to people. I just don't back down from a fight when I'm standing up for what's right. Co-workers B: That's understandable. Speaking of standing up for what's right, do you remember when you asked Karen for money and she was hesitant at first?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs.\n2. Co-worker A has presented evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past.\n3. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument.\n4. Co-worker A plans to present the evidence clearly and persuasively in court.\n5. Co-worker A has experience dealing with challenging clients and emphasizes the importance of communication and setting expectations.\n6. Co-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I remember that. It was challenging, but I made sure to communicate clearly with Karen about why I needed the funds and what I planned to do with them. Setting expectations and being transparent really helped in that situation.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY does provide some helpful context, but it is somewhat mixed in terms of its relevance and connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Some sentences align well with the ongoing conversation, specifically those mentioning Co-worker A's experience with presenting evidence in court (#2) and the emphasis on facts and figures (#6), which ties back to the conversation about backing claims with evidence. However, other sentences, like #3, #4, and #5, seem to be less relevant to the specific topic discussed in the dialogue, which is more about Co-worker A's public speaking skills and experiences in debates rather than ongoing case preparation or challenging clients. Some sentences in MEMORY are not as directly connected to the specific dynamics or events discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which limits its usefulness in generating a relevant next response. Overall, MEMORY could more clearly demonstrate the continuity and relevance to the dialogue, which suggests a mid-level score of 3."
