    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway? Wife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go? Husband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city. Wife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change. Husband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think? Wife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it. Husband: Great. I'll start looking for rental cabins right away. I know this may sound impulsive, but I'm really excited to make this happen.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband has long-awaited plans and is finally taking action on them.\n2. The husband is excited about his progress on long-awaited plans and is putting in a lot of effort to make them a reality.\n3. The husband is inspired by his wife to take action on his dreams and goals.\n4. The husband got impatient and excited about his plans, leading him to leave without the wife.\n5. The wife offers her support and encouragement to the husband in his journey towards achieving his dreams.\n6. The wife supports the husband's goals but wanted to be involved in them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's okay, husband. I'm glad you're excited and taking action on our plans. I'll support you all the way.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but also includes details that are not directly aligned with the conversation. The MEMORY includes elements like the husband's excitement, the wife's encouragement, and the husband's plans, which ties to the context of the husband excitedly planning a getaway. However, some memories, like the husband leaving without the wife, don't naturally connect with the peaceful getaway conversation and could confuse the generation of a response. Overall, the MEMORY has some helpful elements for generating a response but could be clearer and more directly connected to the dialogue."
