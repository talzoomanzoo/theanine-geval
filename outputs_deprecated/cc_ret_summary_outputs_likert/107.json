Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor B reassures Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasizes their current friendship.\n2. Neighbors A did this as a gesture of appreciation for Neighbors B's actions in the neighborhood.\n3. Neighbors A surprised Neighbors B with a pizza.\n4. Neighbors A is willing to take things slow in their relationship with Neighbors B.\n5. Neighbors A has developed romantic feelings for Neighbors B.\n6. Neighbor A went to the park with their son, who had a great time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad to hear that the breathing exercise helped you relax. It's important to take care of yourself, especially during stressful times.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY does not provide information that is directly helpful for generating a response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about a breathing exercise and relaxation. The memory mostly mentions past interactions, including personal gestures, relationships, and emotions between Neighbors A and B, which are not clearly connected to the current context. Although these details provide some background about their relationship, they lack clear causality or development related to the topic of relaxation or breathing exercises, making it difficult for a language model to generate an informed response. The memory sentences are naturally phrased but do not connect to the current dialogue issue, offering limited help in developing a relevant conversation."
