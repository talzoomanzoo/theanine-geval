Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria. Co-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking? Co-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A.\n2. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n3. Co-worker B reminds Co-worker A of their progress and potential for success.\n4. Co-worker B points out that Co-worker A doesn't always consider how their actions can affect others.\n5. Co-worker A is trying to be more conscious of how their actions impact others and avoid causing problems for anyone else.\n6. Co-workers A and B have worked together on a big story in the past.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That works for me. I appreciate you reaching out and including me. Looking forward to catching up at lunch!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains a mix of helpful and less relevant information for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context involves a simple invitation for lunch, while the MEMORY seems more focused on the interpersonal and developmental dynamics between Co-workers A and B. Points 1-3 provide an understanding of the supportive nature of Co-worker B towards A, which indicates a positive relationship. This can help in crafting a polite and friendly response. Points 4-5 touch on the introspective aspects of Co-worker A's behavior changes based on feedback from Co-worker B, which may not be immediately relevant to the lunch invitation but offers insights into their relationship. Point 6, referring to a shared work experience, again, isn't directly useful for the immediate response but adds depth to understanding their past collaboration. Overall, the MEMORY has a broader context but does provide some cues that can help in setting the tone for the response."
