Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway? Wife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go? Husband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city. Wife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change. Husband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think? Wife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it. Husband: Great. I'll start looking for rental cabins right away. I know this may sound impulsive, but I'm really excited to make this happen. Wife: Don't worry, husband, it's not impulsive. You always follow through with your plans, and I believe this will be a wonderful experience for both of us. Husband: Thank you, wife. And, I want to apologize for the time I left without waiting for you. I know I promised to wait, and I should have kept my word. Wife: It's okay, husband. I understand that you were in a hurry, and it wasn't intentional. Besides, that was a long time ago, and we've moved past it. Husband: Thank you for being so understanding, wife. I just want to make sure I am not repeating the same mistake again. Wife: I trust that you won't, husband. And hey, remember when I stopped a runaway carriage from causing harm to a group of people? That was quite the adrenaline rush!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband apologized and promised to involve the wife in his plans in the future.\n2. The husband acknowledges his mistake, apologizes, and promises to make it up to his wife, emphasizing the importance of keeping promises and taking action.\n3. The husband got impatient and excited about his plans, leading him to leave without the wife.\n4. The husband has long-awaited plans and is finally taking action on them.\n5. The husband is excited about his progress on long-awaited plans and is putting in a lot of effort to make them a reality.\n6. The wife brings up past disappointment when the husband left without her, breaking a promise to wait for her.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Wow, I do remember that! You were amazing, wife. Your quick thinking and bravery saved the day. I'm lucky to have you by my side.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant and structured information that is helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences in the MEMORY capture key aspects of the interaction between the husband and wife, such as the husband's apology (1, 2) and acknowledgment of his past mistake (2, 3), which is directly linked to the dialogue where he apologizes for leaving without waiting for her. The MEMORY also highlights the husband's excitement and efforts towards his plans (4, 5), which are consistent with the dialogue about the getaway plans. The wife's past disappointment is mentioned (6), correlating with her reassurance in the dialogue. However, while all elements are present, the connection between past interactions and plans could be slightly more integrated for a perfect score. However, overall, the MEMORY is coherent and naturally structured, aiding in understanding the context."
