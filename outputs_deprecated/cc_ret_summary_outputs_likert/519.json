    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. Neighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off. Neighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks? Neighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else. Neighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location? Neighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home. Neighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become. Neighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice. Neighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along?  Neighbors A: It's finished! Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. It was a lot of work, but worth it in the end.  Neighbors B: That's amazing, thanks for building me such a beautiful house.  Neighbors A: Of course, I'm glad you like it. Remember when we watched the sunset over the London skyline? That was such a beautiful moment. Neighbors B: Yes, I still remember the pink and orange hues reflecting off the buildings. It was breathtaking. Neighbors A: Speaking of London, have you heard about those recent cases of identity theft? It's terrible that people like that exist.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor B reminds Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them.\n2. Neighbors A helped Neighbors B build a new house with amazing features.\n3. Neighbor A and Neighbor B discuss organizing a community event to make a positive impact and appreciate the beauty of their city.\n4. Neighbors B is enjoying the sunset from their new backyard, expressing gratitude towards Neighbors A.\n5. Neighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly.\n6. Neighbor B is looking forward to seeing the finished house and is excited about the new project.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I've heard about it. It's important to stay vigilant and protect our personal information. But let's focus on the positive and plan that community event we were talking about. It's a great opportunity to make a difference in our city.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some information that can be helpful in generating appropriate continuations to a conversation. Sentences 1 and 2 are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as they directly reference the house project that Neighbor A completed for Neighbor B, which was discussed in the context. Sentence 4 also aligns with the context as it appears to continue the discussion about the newly built house. \n\nHowever, the rest of the MEMORY (sentences 3, 5, and 6) are less directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT provided. Sentence 3 discusses another topic not mentioned in the dialogue, such as organizing a community event. Sentences 5 and 6 refer to Neighbor A's skills and attitude towards quickly finishing houses and Neighbor Bâ€™s anticipation, which lean towards a more general context rather than the specific conversation about the past project and its completion.\n\nWhile some sentences in MEMORY do connect well with DIALOGUE CONTEXT and help in understanding the speakers' past interactions, others are less relevant, bringing down the overall helpfulness. The sentences in MEMORY are mostly naturally phrased and structured, but more focused and contextually specific content would be helpful for a higher assessment score."
