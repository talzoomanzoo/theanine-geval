Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I can't believe how honored I am to be part of our class. I feel like we have something special going on here.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B complimented Classmates A on their suit and brought up a past conversation about feelings.\n2. Classmate B feels relieved that they can still be friends with Classmate A.\n3. Classmates B appreciates Classmates A's honesty about their feelings, but doesn't feel the same way.\n4. Classmate A has been hiding their feelings for Classmate B and finally confesses to being in love with them.\n5. Classmates A values their friendship with Classmates B and looks forward to wearing a black suit to a wedding reception.\n6. Classmates A is excited for a wedding reception and plans to dance with the bride.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "The MEMORY provided offers some relevant details that could aid in generating a response to the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Here is the breakdown of how the MEMORY aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\n\n1. DIALOGUE CONTEXT indicates a feeling of honor and a sense of something special happening within the class - suggesting a positive and potentially emotional atmosphere. \n\n2. MEMORY points 1, 2, 3, and 4 include significant interactions between Classmates A and B, detailing compliments, confessions of love, and feelings of relief and friendship. These points provide background on the emotional dynamics between them, which could help generate a response appreciating the closeness in the class.\n\n3. MEMORY point 5 further reinforces Classmate A's sense of value in the friendship and even a future event (the wedding reception), showcasing excitement similar to what's expressed in DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\n4. MEMORY point 6, while not directly related to the context, still maintains a positive tone and plans - revealing more about Classmate A's excitement and future-oriented thinking, which might influence a response to the context.\n\nOverall, MEMORY demonstrates a development of interactions from complimenting and acknowledging feelings to planning future events (wedding reception). These insights are relevant and could guide a contextually fitting response. Therefore, I would rate this MEMORY a 4 out of 5, as it successfully highlights key relationships and sentiments that may influence the conversation forward, although it could be more directly linked to the feeling of being honored specifically in the context. \n\nHelpfulness Score: 4"
