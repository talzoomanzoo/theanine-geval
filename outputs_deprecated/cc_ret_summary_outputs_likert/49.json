    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today. Classmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about? Classmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B noticed Classmates A's improvement and acknowledged their hard work.\n2. Classmate B is working on finishing a history project.\n3. Classmates B recalls a funny moment from high school involving Classmates A wearing pajamas to school.\n4. Classmate B is interested in attending a new technology conference next month.\n5. Classmates A's grades are looking good according to their teacher.\n6. Classmates A had a moment of frustration in the past but has learned to channel that energy into studies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains sentences that are not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about a talk on the history of pyramids. The sentences in MEMORY relate to different aspects of Classmates A and B's interactions, such as academic performance, personal anecdotes, future plans, and history projects, but none of these connect specifically to the topic of the talk or the pyramids discussion in the context. Moreover, the sentences do not provide a clear development or causality that would help the language model generate a response pertinent to the given context. They appear as disjointed facts without a clear link to the current dialogue, thus they do not offer useful contextual cues for crafting an appropriate next response."
