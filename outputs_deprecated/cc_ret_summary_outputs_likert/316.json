Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway? Wife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go? Husband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city. Wife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change. Husband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think? Wife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it. Husband: Great. I'll start looking for rental cabins right away. I know this may sound impulsive, but I'm really excited to make this happen. Wife: Don't worry, husband, it's not impulsive. You always follow through with your plans, and I believe this will be a wonderful experience for both of us. Husband: Thank you, wife. And, I want to apologize for the time I left without waiting for you. I know I promised to wait, and I should have kept my word.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband apologized and promised to involve the wife in his plans in the future.\n2. The husband has long-awaited plans and is finally taking action on them.\n3. The husband got impatient and excited about his plans, leading him to leave without the wife.\n4. The husband is excited about his progress on long-awaited plans and is putting in a lot of effort to make them a reality.\n5. The husband is inspired by his wife to take action on his dreams and goals.\n6. The husband acknowledges his mistake, apologizes, and promises to make it up to his wife, emphasizing the importance of keeping promises and taking action.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's okay, husband. I appreciate your apology and your effort to make things right. I know you'll make up for it with this weekend getaway. Thank you for acknowledging your mistake and promising to involve me in your plans in the future.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains several points that are relevant and helpful for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures the key elements from the context, such as the husband's apology and his plans to involve the wife in future decisions (points 1 and 6), which directly relate to the husband's final apology in the context. It also highlights the husband's excitement and proactive approach to his plans (points 2, 4, and 5), which reflects the dialogues where he expresses eagerness about the getaway. Although some sentences are more focused on a broader behavior pattern rather than specific past interactions (e.g., point 5), the MEMORY as a whole provides a coherent understanding of the husband's motivation and the couple's dynamic. Such information is beneficial for a language model in generating a response that acknowledges these aspects, making the MEMORY mostly helpful and earning a score of 4."
