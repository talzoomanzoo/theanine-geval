    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm really excited about finding a buyer for my product. I think it has a lot of potential. Neighbors B: That's great to hear, what kind of product is it? Neighbors A: It's a new type of workout equipment that's designed to be more efficient than traditional equipment. I've been working on it for months now and I really think it's going to take off. Neighbors B: Wow, that sounds interesting. Have you started looking for potential buyers?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's efforts to change and become a better version of themselves.\n2. Neighbors B expresses a desire for Neighbors A to succeed and emphasizes the importance of treating others with respect and putting in effort at work.\n3. Neighbors A and Neighbors B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as they enjoy having coffee and chatting together.\n4. Neighbors A is trying to improve their behavior at work and be a better colleague.\n5. Neighbors A acknowledges the need to work harder, be nicer to colleagues, and improve their behavior.\n6. Neighbors A is having issues at work, such as not pulling their weight and being rude to colleagues.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, I've been reaching out to some fitness centers and personal trainers. I'm really hoping to make some connections and get this product out there.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains information about the relationship and work behavior of Neighbors A and B, which is somewhat relevant to their interactions but does not directly connect with the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Neighbors A's new product and potential buyers. While MEMORY highlights the supportive relationship between the neighbors, it lacks direct references or cues that would help generate an appropriate response about the product or finding buyers. The sentences do reflect a general understanding of the relationship dynamics, but they do not provide the necessary context for advancing the specific dialogue about the product sales. There is some natural phrasing indicating their supportive relationship, but it is not substantially beneficial in this context."
