Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nAthlete: Ted Athlete unrolls the map. He looks at it for a few moments before tracing his finger along one of the highways. \"This is our route,\" he says finally, feeling in control. Coach: What route are you planning, Ted? Athlete: I'm thinking of taking the highway through the mountains, it's a bit longer, but the scenery is beautiful. Coach: That sounds like a good plan, as long as we factor in enough time for rest stops and breaks. Athlete: Yes, I was thinking we could stop at a few rest areas along the way. It's important to stay hydrated and keep our energy levels up during long drives. Coach: Definitely. Speaking of energy levels, how's your nutrition plan been going? Have you been keeping up with eating healthy foods like those bean sprouts we talked about?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The coach advises the athlete on pre-game meals, emphasizing the need for a balance of carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats, as well as staying hydrated.\n2. The Coach is giving advice to the Athlete regarding their performance and focus.\n3. The coach encourages the athlete to continue their good work with nutrition and training.\n4. The athlete is concerned about nutrition and improving their diet.\n5. The Athlete is focused on improving their performance and energy levels.\n6. Both the Athlete and Coach emphasize the importance of small changes in diet impacting performance.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, Coach, I've been making sure to include those bean sprouts in my meals. I've noticed a difference in my energy levels already. It's amazing how small changes in diet can really impact performance.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY effectively relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT by including several elements that support the current conversation between the Athlete and the Coach. Specifically, it contains points about nutrition and performance, which are pertinent to the dialogue since the Coach inquires about the Athlete's nutrition plan and discusses energy levels. The sentences are naturally structured to reflect past interactions focused on these themes. The memory snippets about pre-game meals and the athlete's focus on nutrition and performance provide helpful contextual cues that could inform the generation of a relevant response. However, the MEMORY could be improved by being more specific or by reflecting more past interactions and details related strictly to the current dialogue's theme. Despite that, it allows for the easy identification of key ongoing concerns (nutrition and energy levels) that are currently present in the dialogue context."
