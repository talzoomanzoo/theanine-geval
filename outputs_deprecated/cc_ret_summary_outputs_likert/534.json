Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind? Classmates A: I know about your affair with that other woman. Classmates B: What are you talking about? I don't have an affair with anyone.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A has developed a crush on Classmates B, which Classmates B finds flattering.\n2. Classmates A and B have a good relationship, with Classmates A expressing admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor.\n3. Both Classmates A and B enjoy talking to each other and consider themselves great study partners.\n4. Classmates A suggests grabbing lunch together, showing an interest in spending more time with Classmates B.\n5. Both Classmates A and B are open to exploring a romantic connection and are looking forward to getting to know each other better.\n6. Classmates A and B are interested in biology and studying cells.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant background information about Classmates A and B, such as their good relationship, admiration, shared interests, and potential romantic connection. This can provide context for Classmates A's concern about Classmates B's alleged affair. However, MEMORY does not directly address or hint at any suspicion of infidelity, nor does it provide any insight into Classmates B's actions that could justify Classmates A's claim of an affair. While the information on their relationship and interactions might be helpful for understanding the nature of their conversation, it lacks specific relevance to the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, the MEMORY is clear and well-structured but is missing critical relevance to the immediate concern, warranting a moderate score."
