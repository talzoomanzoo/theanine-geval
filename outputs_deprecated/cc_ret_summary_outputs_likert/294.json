Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message. Co-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident. Co-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows. Co-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive. Co-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right. Co-workers B: Speaking of convincing people, have you ever been in a physical altercation before? Co-workers A: Yes, unfortunately. But that doesn't mean I'm a danger to people. I just don't back down from a fight when I'm standing up for what's right.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs.\n2. Co-worker A plans to present the evidence clearly and persuasively in court.\n3. Co-worker A has presented evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past.\n4. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument.\n5. Co-worker A has experience dealing with challenging clients and emphasizes the importance of communication and setting expectations.\n6. Co-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes references to Co-worker A's experience in presenting evidence and their skills in public speaking and debating, which are relevant to the context of the conversation. Sentences like \"Co-worker A has presented evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past\" and \"Co-worker A plans to present the evidence clearly and persuasively in court\" directly connect to the dialogue context where Co-worker A talks about practicing and presenting compelling arguments in debates and court. Additionally, the memory also reflects on Co-worker A's skills related to communication and setting expectations, which are beneficial in understanding their overall proficiency and confidence, tying into the dialogue about public speaking and standing up for their beliefs. The sentences are naturally phrased and connected, portraying the development and causality of events. The MEMORY is not perfect as some points like dealing with challenging clients slightly deviate from the main context around debates and public speaking, yet they are naturally connected to the broader theme of Co-worker A's skills and experience. Overall, it effectively aids in generating appropriate responses in the ongoing dialogue."
