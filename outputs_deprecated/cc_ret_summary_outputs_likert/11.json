Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process.\n2. The Mentee has been offered a job and has decided to take the job in the city.\n3. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n4. The Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process.\n5. Mentee agreed to go back to the store to make things right and expressed gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n6. Mentee feels like they are running out of time and is worried about the upcoming SAT.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's completely normal to feel that way when you're in a new place. Remember, building new friendships takes time and effort. You'll find your community soon enough, just give it some time.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains sentences that indicate some past interactions between the Mentor and Mentee, such as support and guidance during decision-making and reassurance offered by the Mentor. However, it does not directly address the specific issue of loneliness in a new city, which is the main concern in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the sentences are somewhat fragmented and do not clearly demonstrate a connection or flow that would provide a comprehensive understanding of the Mentee's current situation. The available information may assist in general context but lacks direct relevance or useful cues to the current topic of loneliness."
