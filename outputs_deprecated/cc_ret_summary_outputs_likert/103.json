Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager! Co-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role. Co-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness.

Co-workers A: We definitely did. And it taught me to just take things one step at a time, like I am with this new role. Co-workers B: Exactly, and I'm sure you'll apply that same mentality to your training as well. I remember you were really dedicated to it a couple of years ago. Co-workers A: Oh yeah, I still try to keep up with it whenever I can. It's important to stay physically and mentally fit, especially with this new job. Co-workers B: Just don't let your anger get the better of you again. Remember when you exploded and started throwing things?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader.\n2. Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n3. Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\n4. Co-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication.\n5. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n6.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided has some relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly regarding Co-worker A's journey towards a leadership role. Sentences like \"Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader\" and \"Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work\" are helpful as they connect with the context where Co-worker A discusses their new role as a product manager and their aspirations. However, the MEMORY lacks depth and context about the development of Co-worker A and Co-worker B's relationship, as well as specific past interactions mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT such as stress or anger management. Additionally, there seems to be some repetition in the statements, which does not add value to the overall context. Therefore, while there are useful elements present, the MEMORY could provide more diverse and detailed information to fully support the generation of an appropriate next response."
