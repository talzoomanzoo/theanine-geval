Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately. Classmates B: Why is that? Classmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically. Classmates B: That's a good goal to have. Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra? Classmates A: Definitely. I feel like I'm able to break down problems and analyze them more effectively. Classmates B: It's always rewarding when hard work pays off. Classmates A: Yes it is. It reminds me of when I proved my brother wrong in that race. I was so determined to win and it paid off in the end. Classmates B: It's great to see that determination and hard work lead to success in different areas of life. Classmates A: And even when I felt that pain in my arm, I waited and it eventually went away. Classmates B: It's important to listen to your body and take care of yourself. Classmates A: Exactly. And sometimes, it's nice to just take a break and enjoy a quiet moment to yourself.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B emphasizes the importance of enjoying the journey and effort put in, not just focusing on winning.\n2. Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness.\n3. Classmates A is always looking to challenge themselves and improve their skills.\n4. Classmates A is struggling with feeling competitive and the need to be the best at everything.\n5. Classmates A faced tough competition in middle school from a fast girl, motivating them to improve.\n6. Classmate A emphasizes the importance of self-care and relaxation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's so true. Taking time for yourself is just as important as working hard. It's all about finding that balance.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some pieces of information that could be helpful in generating a response. For instance, points 1, 2, and 6 reflect sentiments shared by the speakers in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, showing Classmates B's emphasis on the journey and Classmates A's realization on self-care. However, the MEMORY could improve in clarity and relevance; some points (like 3, 4, and 5) offer general insights into Classmates A's motivations but lack direct connection to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The link between the provided MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is somewhat loose, and the memory does not consistently offer key contextual cues for crafting the next response. Thus, there is room for improvement in making MEMORY more focused and aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
