Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today? Co-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing. Co-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed. Co-workers B: That's really nice of you, but I don't want to burden you with my work.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\n2. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health.\n3. Co-worker B is supportive and glad that Co-worker A is okay.\n4. Co-worker B is glad to have been able to help Co-worker A and feels the trade worked out well for both of them.\n5. Co-worker A values their health to continue working at their best.\n6. Both co-workers are looking forward to starting their partnership and are open to seeking extra help if needed.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several sentences that seem to capture interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, but they do not provide much helpful or relevant information for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT given. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves Co-worker A offering help to Co-worker B, who politely declines, whereas the MEMORY mostly describes scenarios where Co-worker B is trying to help Co-worker A. This makes it difficult for the language model to use these memories directly to predict the natural development of the dialogue. Sentences in the MEMORY lack a clear, relevant connection to the current scenario and don't offer enough context or relevant development to aid the generation of the next response. However, they are well-structured, which makes them slightly helpful, leading to a score of 2."
