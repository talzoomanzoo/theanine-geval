Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today? Classmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own. Classmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as evidenced by their conversation about their respective experiences.\n2. Classmates A and B are both keeping up with the homework in their math class.\n3. Classmates A enjoys reminiscing about childhood memories, particularly about playing on swings and making music with friends.\n4. Classmates B finds it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after a conversation they had about following dreams.\n5. Classmates A finds pursuing music rewarding and is passionate about it.\n6. Classmates B is interested in learning to play an instrument.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks for understanding. I'm really inspired by your passion for music. It's cool to see someone pursuing their dreams like that.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY has some potentially relevant sentences, such as the supportive relationship indicated in sentence 1, which aligns with the supportive interaction in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the majority of the memory sentences are not directly applicable to the current dialogue. The sentences about music and Classmates B's interest in learning to play an instrument (sentences 3, 4, 5, and 6) do not connect to the present conversation about frustration and dependence. Sentence 2, regarding homework, is irrelevant to the current dialogue context. While the MEMORY does have some naturally structured sentences, it lacks clear connection or causal development tied to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it less helpful for generating the next response."
