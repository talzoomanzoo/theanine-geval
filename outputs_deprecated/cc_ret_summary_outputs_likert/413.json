Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately. Classmates B: Why is that?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate A and Classmate B are classmates.\n2. Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness.\n3. Classmates A is struggling with feeling competitive and the need to be the best at everything.\n4. Classmates A is always looking to challenge themselves and improve their skills.\n5. Classmates B is supportive and emphasizes the importance of having someone to talk to about personal matters.\n6. Classmates A has not experienced similar pains in the past and is feeling worried about the situation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and beneficial information to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It presents a clear connection and development of past interactions between Classmate A and Classmate B. The information that Classmates B acknowledges Classmate A's determination and competitiveness is directly relevant, as it can explain why Classmate A is focusing on studying algebra. Additionally, knowing that Classmate A is naturally competitive, struggles with needing to be the best (point 3), and constantly seeks to improve (point 4) aids in understanding their drive to study. The supportive nature of Classmate B (point 5) can help in shaping a supportive response. The point about Classmate A feeling worried about a situation (point 6) is not directly related but adds depth to their character, indicating potential stress that might shape their study habits or conversations. Overall, the MEMORY is structured well and provides contextual cues useful for generating a response, although not all points are directly related to the current dialogue."
