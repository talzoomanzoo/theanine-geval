    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned? Classmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed. Classmates A: Embarrassed? Why? Classmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during the difficult situation.\n2. Classmates B praised Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n3. Classmates A is stranded in space, running out of oxygen and feeling lightheaded.\n4. Classmate B admires Classmate A's attitude and sees it as a good example for others.\n5. Classmates A helped Classmates B out of friendship and believes in supporting each other.\n6. Classmate B acknowledges Classmate A's success in their career due to their determination and refusal to settle for mediocrity.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's okay, we all have those moments. If you want to talk about it, I'm here to listen.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does not provide helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context involves an interaction between two classmates discussing why Classmate B's face is red and splotchy, with a hint towards embarrassment. However, the MEMORY focuses on unrelated topics such as being stranded in space, showing gratitude, praising resilience, supporting each other, and career success. These topics do not connect or provide useful cues for generating a response related to the embarrassment theme discussed in the context. Thus, the MEMORY is not structured in a way that aids in understanding the past interactions between the speakers concerning the present situation."
