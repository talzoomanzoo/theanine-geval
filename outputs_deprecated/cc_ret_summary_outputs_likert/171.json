Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend! Co-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang. Co-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while. Co-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing? Co-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites. Co-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice. Co-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it. Co-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent. Co-workers A: Thanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it. Co-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have a hobby like that. Reminds me of when you uncovered that mystery a while back. You always seem to surprise us with your skills. Co-workers A: Haha, yeah. I do like a good challenge. Speaking of surprises, remember when I found out you were married? That was a shocker.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n2. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together.\n3. Co-worker A has a talent for solving puzzles and mysteries.\n4. Co-worker A is observant and did some research on social media to find out that Co-worker B is married.\n5. Co-worker A is described as having \"Sherlock Holmes-like skills\" and enjoys solving mysteries.\n6. Co-worker B is married and had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Haha, yeah, that was definitely unexpected. You definitely have those Sherlock Holmes-like skills!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Co-worker A's interest in solving mysteries (points 3 and 5), which aligns with their conversation about Co-worker A's various skills and surprises. Additionally, the MEMORY notes that Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A discovered they were married (point 1), which directly correlates with the current context of them reminiscing about past surprises. However, the MEMORY also contains sentences that are not immediately relevant to generating the next response in the current context, such as the specific activities Co-worker B did over the weekend (point 6). Therefore, while there is some helpful and relevant information provided, not all sentences in the MEMORY contribute to a clear development of dialogue relevant to the current interaction. The rating of 3 reflects this mix of helpfulness and less relevant information."
