Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life. Child: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you. Parent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you. Child: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The child is supportive and caring towards the parent.\n3. The child offers help and reassurance to the parent.\n4. Both the parent and child express love and support for each other.\n5. The child is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes.\n6. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I did feel that way at times. But having you there to listen and support me made all the difference. Thank you for always being there for me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides relevant information for understanding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Most sentences reflect the supportive and caring dynamic between the Parent and Child which is evident in the dialogue. For instance, Sentence 1 about the Parent finding hope in tough situations and Sentence 5 where the Child is proud of the Parent for making changes aligns with the Child’s inquiry about the Parent's experience in detention and highlights how the Child values the Parent’s perspective on listening during tough times. These sentences give context to their relationship dynamics, showing the Child’s interest in the Parent's past experiences, and the Parent's values. The MEMORY is well-structured and relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, facilitating a language model’s understanding for generating an appropriate response. However, the MEMORY does not specifically address any experience the Parent had in detention, leading to a score of 4 instead of 5."
