    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, check out this spot I found to camp out for the night. It's perfect! Classmates B: Wow, this view is amazing! Classmates A: I know, right? And it's completely level and free of any debris. We won't have to worry about rolling off our sleeping pads or anything like that. Classmates B: It definitely looks like a great spot to spend the night. How did you manage to find it? Classmates A: Just a stroke of luck, I guess. I was exploring the area and stumbled upon it. It's always good to be a little adventurous and explore new places, you never know what you might find.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate A expresses a desire to find alternative ways to have fun and make a positive impact in the community.\n2. Classmates A is proactive and curious, taking the initiative to research topics of interest.\n3. Classmates B finds Classmates A's involvement in the community admirable and important.\n4. Classmates B remembers Classmates A's previous involvement in community improvement projects and acknowledges their passion for making a difference.\n5. Classmate A and Classmate B are classmates who attended a party together.\n6. Classmate B agrees to keep the party a secret in exchange for Classmate A doing their homework for a week.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's really cool that you took the time to explore and found this hidden gem. Your adventurous spirit always leads to discovering interesting places.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains some general information about Classmate A's personality (e.g., being proactive and curious, involvement in community improvement projects) and background interactions between the two classmates (e.g., attending a party together, making a deal about homework). However, most of the details are not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about finding a campsite. The MEMORY lacks specific information about past camping experiences or relevant interactions related to nature exploration that would help the language model generate a suitable response in this specific context. The sentences in MEMORY are naturally structured, but they don't provide much causal or relevant information for the context provided, leading to a lower score in helpfulness."
