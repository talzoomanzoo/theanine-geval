    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to share something with you. I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend. Classmates B: That's really kind of you. What did you do to help? Classmates A: She was moving and needed some extra hands to pack up her things and load them onto a truck. So I spent most of the day helping her out. Classmates B: Wow, that's really generous of you. I'm sure your neighbor really appreciated it. Classmates A: I hope so. I just felt like it was the right thing to do. I know if I were in that situation, I would appreciate any help I could get.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B has been supportive and helpful to Classmates A.\n2. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support.\n3. Classmates A appreciates the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n4. Classmates B handled a previous mix-up with the class schedule well, showing responsibility and reliability.\n5. Classmates A and B started as acquaintances and have developed a strong friendship.\n6. Classmates A and B value their friendship and feel comfortable talking to each other about anything.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You have such a big heart, always willing to lend a helping hand. Your neighbor is lucky to have you around.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY includes some sentences that might be indirectly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, like the established friendship and support between Classmates A and B (sentences 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6). These provide contextual background about their relationship, which can help in understanding the context of their conversation in DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, there is no direct mention of specific past events or interactions related to the act of helping out a neighbor, which is the primary focus of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 4 regarding a class schedule mix-up is not related to the current dialogue and seems less relevant. Overall, while MEMORY provides some useful background, its connection to the current conversation is limited, hence the score of 3."
