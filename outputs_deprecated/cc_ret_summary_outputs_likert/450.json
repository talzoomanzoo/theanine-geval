    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I know you know something about my past. Can you tell me what it is? Classmates B: I'm sorry,, but I can't disclose that information. It's not my place to tell. Classmates A: But how did you find out? I haven't told anyone.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B warns Classmates A about the potential danger of dark alleys.\n2. Classmates A is curious and open to exploring new things and taking risks.\n3. Classmates A and B became friends when Classmates A transferred to the school.\n4. Classmates A encountered a mysterious woman in a dark alley, finding her intriguing.\n5. Classmates B advises Classmates A to be careful and aware while on the bus.\n6. Classmates A was nervous about fitting in but saw Classmates B as well-liked and wanted to be friends with them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant context related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically points 3 and 6. They establish a background of friendship and social dynamics between the classmates, which can help a language model generate more contextually aware responses. The other points, while not directly related to the current dialogue, offer insights into the personalities and interactions between Classmates A and B, thus contributing indirectly to understanding their relationship. However, these points are somewhat disjointed and less directly connected to the immediate dialogue about secrecy and past knowledge, leading to an average score. The memory could be more helpful if it included more direct connections to Classmates A's concern about privacy and how Classmates B knows something about their past."
