Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess. Classmates B: Wait, what? You cheated on your taxes? That's not okay. Classmates A: I know, I know. I was just really struggling financially and I thought I could get away with it. Classmates B: You can't just cheat and hope to never get caught. That's not how it works. Classmates A: Remember when we talked about me wanting to become a professional basketball player? Classmates B: Yeah, I remember. So, what does that have to do with cheating on your taxes? Classmates A: It's just that I feel like I keep hitting roadblocks in my life. Every time I try to move forward, something happens to set me back. It's really discouraging. Classmates B: I understand that it can be tough, but cheating isn't the answer. You have to keep working hard and doing the right thing, even when it's hard. Classmates A: On a completely different note, do you remember when I got a job at the local grocery store? Classmates B: Yeah, you seemed really happy with that job.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A believes in hard work and dedication to achieve goals both in basketball and their job.\n2. Classmate A is pursuing a dream of becoming a professional basketball player and is working at a grocery store to save up money for training.\n3. Classmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed.\n4. Classmates A has a big dream of becoming a professional basketball player and works hard towards that goal.\n5. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to keep pushing themselves and not let doubts hold them back.\n6. Classmate B brought goods to Classmate A's house and is supportive of their basketball dream.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, working at the grocery store has been helping me save up money for training and pursuing my dream of becoming a professional basketball player. It's a tough journey, but I'm not giving up. Your support means a lot to me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives background on Classmate A's ambitions of becoming a professional basketball player and their financial struggles, which is connected to the dialogue about Classmate A's current situation of tax issues and feeling discouraged. The MEMORY also outlines Classmate B's supportive role, which is reflected in the dialogue's encouragement from Classmate B. Although not all MEMORY entries are directly relevant to the cheating incident, they are naturally phrased and provide a coherent picture of the interactions between the classmates, supporting the progression of their conversation and emotional states. Overall, while not every sentence is directly applicable to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, the MEMORY's structure maintains a meaningful flow and offers context to enhance the language model's response generation."
