Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria. Co-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking? Co-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you? Co-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you. Co-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago? Co-workers B: Yeah, I remember that conversation. What about it? Co-workers A: Well, I wanted to share some good news with you. I've been recently promoted to the night shift and have been doing a great job. I think I've come a long way since those days. Co-workers B: That's awesome, congratulations! I'm proud of you and all the hard work you've put in. You've definitely grown and matured in the workplace. Co-workers A: Thank you, I appreciate that. But I have to admit, I'm still a bit nervous about being wrong. Remember when we talked about my constantly questioning myself and second-guessing my decisions? Co-workers B: Yeah, I remember that. Is there anything specific that's been bothering you? Co-workers A: Not really, it's just a general feeling of uncertainty at times. But hey, speaking of uncertainty, do you remember when we talked about my love for singing a while ago? Co-workers B: Yes, I do. How's that been going for you? Co-workers A: It's actually been going really well. I recently auditioned for a major singing competition and was chosen as a finalist. Co-workers B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations, I had no idea you were still pursuing singing.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B reminds Co-worker A of their progress and potential for success.\n2. Co-worker A has been working hard on their singing skills and has a passion for music.\n3. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n4. Co-worker A expresses nervousness and self-doubt despite their achievements.\n5. Co-worker B has moved on from their arrest and appreciates Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior.\n6. Co-worker A appreciates Co-worker B's support and plans to perform in the final round of the competition.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information that relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly in terms of key interactions and themes mentioned between the co-workers. Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately capture the essence of their dialogue such as progress, music passion, reassurance, and self-doubt, offering a clear summary of the emotional and contextual elements discussed. Statement 6 builds on the singing achievement mentioned and is a reasonable extension of the conversation about Co-worker A's singing success. However, statement 5 introduces a topic (arrest) that is not related to the dialogue context, making it slightly less relevant and cohesive. Despite this, the MEMORY effectively highlights important contextual cues and helps understand the background for an appropriate next response."
