    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?

Classmates A: I can't stand that you're a better singer than I am. I'm envious of your talent and success. Classmates B: That's not a reason to try and destroy my life. If you're feeling insecure about your own abilities, that's something you need to work on. Don't take it out on other people.\n\nMEMORY:\n1.

    "raw_prediction": "I'm sorry, I got carried away and let my jealousy cloud my judgment. I appreciate your honesty and I'll work on addressing my insecurities. Thank you for understanding.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some background information about Classmates A and B's past interactions, such as their good relationship, mutual admiration, and potential romantic interest. However, it does not directly address the apparent conflict and tension presented in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY lacks information about any past conflicts or jealousy, which are crucial to understanding the current situation in the dialogue. Some aspects of the MEMORY, like Classmate A's admiration for Lady Gaga, are not relevant to the dialogue context. While the MEMORY provides general background, it does not offer substantial guidance or context for generating the next response in this specific dialogue."
