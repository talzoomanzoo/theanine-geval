Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn. Teacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation? Student: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle. Teacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time? Student: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then. Teacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going? Student: It's going pretty well. I started with French, but now I'm considering taking up Spanish and German too. I want to become more well-rounded. Teacher: That's a great goal. Have you thought about any specific ways you could use your language skills? Student: I would love to be able to travel more and speak with the locals in their native language. Maybe I could even teach my grandchildren some basic phrases. Teacher: Speaking of your grandchildren, how's your retirement planning going?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The student is studying French at college and plans on learning Spanish and German as well.\n2. The student expresses excitement about retiring and spending time with their grandkids, already planning fun activities.\n3. The teacher encourages the student's retirement plans, highlighting the importance of focusing on family during retirement.\n4. The teacher speaks Spanish and French fluently.\n5. The student is looking forward to retirement and spending time with their grandchildren.\n6. The student has already made plans with their daughter and son-in-law to visit more often and take the grandkids on trips.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides background information about the student's interest in language study (French, Spanish, and German), which aligns with the dialogue about languages and the goal of becoming well-rounded. It also provides relevant context about the studentâ€™s retirement plans and spending time with grandchildren, which connects well to the conversation's mention of retirement planning. The MEMORY also includes the teacher's encouragement of retirement plans and the teacher's fluency in Spanish and French, which relates to the context of language learning and usefulness. However, while the MEMORY sentences are generally well-structured, some of them are repeated or convey similar information (e.g., excitement about spending time with grandchildren and retirement planning). This slight repetition prevents the MEMORY from achieving a perfect score, but overall, it still provides useful background for generating a proper next response."
