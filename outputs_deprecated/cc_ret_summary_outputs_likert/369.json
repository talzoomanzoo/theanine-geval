Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: It's great to have friends who can help each other out, isn't it? Neighbors B: Absolutely. It's a two-way street, and it's important to be there for each other.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the suggestion.\n2. Neighbors A bought a necklace from Neighbors B's shop and loves it.\n3. Neighbors B emphasized the importance of apologizing to show care for the relationship.\n4. Neighbors B offered to help Neighbors A with the apology process.\n5. Both neighbors express the difficulty of not being able to adopt all the animals they see but appreciate those who do adopt and give them loving homes.\n6. Neighbors A was looking for a new necklace and stumbled upon Neighbors B's shop.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, I couldn't agree more. And I really appreciate your willingness to help me with the apology process. It means a lot to me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information about the past interactions of the neighbors, which may provide helpful context for generating a response. Specifically, sentences 1, 2, and 6 pertain to previous interactions involving a necklace purchase, indicating a positive and supportive relationship that aligns with the dialogue context's theme of mutual help. Sentence 3 and 4 discuss the importance of apologies and offer assistance, potentially useful if the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT were to relate to conflicts or apologies. However, sentence 5 about adopting animals, while naturally phrased, does not connect directly to the dialogue context. Overall, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful, but not all sentences directly relate to the current conversation's theme of mutual support among neighbors. Additionally, while the sentences are naturally structured, they lack explicit causality or development linking them back to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, limiting their utility in generating the next response."
