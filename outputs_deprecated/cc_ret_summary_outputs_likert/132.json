Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\n2. Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received.\n3. Neighbors A is detail-oriented and strives for perfection.\n4. Neighbors A emphasizes the importance of recognizing and thanking each other for acts of kindness.\n5. Neighbors B values reciprocity and acknowledges the mutual help between them as neighbors.\n6. Neighbors B recalls when Neighbors A helped with their lawn, showing mutual support between them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's okay, we all have our moments. I appreciate you recognizing your mistake and apologizing. Let's move forward and continue supporting each other like good neighbors do.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful contextual information regarding the relationship and interactions between Neighbors A and B. It highlights that Neighbors B is understanding and supportive, which directly relates to the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Neighbors A apologizes for swearing. This understanding nature of Neighbors B suggests that they are likely to respond to the apology in a supportive manner. Additionally, the MEMORY notes the theme of mutual support and reciprocity, which is evident in the shared experiences mentioned, such as Neighbors A helping with Neighbors B's lawn. These shared values between the neighbors of supporting each other and emphasizing gratitude suggest a close and positive relationship, which can guide the language model to generate a more appropriate response in line with these observations. However, some sentences, like Neighbors A being detail-oriented, do not directly contribute to this specific context, resulting in a score of 4 instead of 5. Overall, MEMORY effectively supports understanding the context of the apology and likely responses."
