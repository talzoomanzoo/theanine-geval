    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm really excited about finding a buyer for my product. I think it has a lot of potential. Neighbors B: That's great to hear, what kind of product is it? Neighbors A: It's a new type of workout equipment that's designed to be more efficient than traditional equipment. I've been working on it for months now and I really think it's going to take off.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's efforts to change and become a better version of themselves.\n2. Neighbors B expresses a desire for Neighbors A to succeed and emphasizes the importance of treating others with respect and putting in effort at work.\n3. Neighbors A is trying to improve their behavior at work and be a better colleague.\n4. Neighbors A and Neighbors B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as they enjoy having coffee and chatting together.\n5. Neighbors A acknowledges the need to work harder, be nicer to colleagues, and improve their behavior.\n6. Neighbors A is having issues at work, such as not pulling their weight and being rude to colleagues.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm so proud of you for putting in the effort and dedication to create something innovative like that. Your hard work is definitely going to pay off.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a general context of Neighbors A and Neighbors B's supportive relationship and the personal growth of Neighbors A, which is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences mention Neighbors A's efforts to improve themselves and work harder, which aligns with the context of creating a product and putting in effort. However, the MEMORY emphasizes Neighbors A's workplace behavior issues and general improvement efforts, which are not directly related to the product or selling process mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The connection between personal/workplace behavior improvement and product development/selling is present but not strong. Overall, the MEMORY would be more helpful if it included more specific details related to Neighbors A's product development journey or conversations about their business ventures."
