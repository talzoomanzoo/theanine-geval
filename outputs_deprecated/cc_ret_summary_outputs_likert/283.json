    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away. Co-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that. Co-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way. Co-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity.\n3. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's positivity and friendship.\n4. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n5. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\n6. Co-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided does not contain any sentences that directly relate to the specific situation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context is focused on a serious situation where Co-worker A is considering an unethical action motivated by personal feelings. The MEMORY entries, however, touch upon relatively mundane office interactions and qualities like borrowing pencils, positivity, friendship, and bravery, none of which are directly relevant or helpful for generating a response specific to the context given. While MEMORY shows some positive qualities of Co-worker A and supportiveness from Co-worker B, it doesn't address the ethical dilemma or provide information that might be more useful for Unknown to build on this particular conversation. The sentences form a vague picture of past interactions and characteristics but lack clear causality or development related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
