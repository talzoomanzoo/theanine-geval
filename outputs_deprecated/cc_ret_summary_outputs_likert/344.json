Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm really excited about finding a buyer for my product. I think it has a lot of potential. Neighbors B: That's great to hear, what kind of product is it? Neighbors A: It's a new type of workout equipment that's designed to be more efficient than traditional equipment. I've been working on it for months now and I really think it's going to take off. Neighbors B: Wow, that sounds interesting. Have you started looking for potential buyers? Neighbors A: Yes, I've been reaching out to various gyms and fitness centers to see if they'd be interested in carrying the product. I've even gotten some positive feedback from a few places. Neighbors B: That's awesome! I'm sure with your determination, you'll find the perfect buyer soon. Neighbors A: Thanks, I really appreciate your support. It's been a long road, but I'm confident that all my hard work will pay off. Neighbors B: Speaking of hard work, have you made any progress at your current job? I remember you were having some trouble with your boss. Neighbors A: Yeah, unfortunately things didn't work out and I was let go. But I'm trying to look at it as an opportunity to focus on my own business ventures.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B expresses a desire for Neighbors A to succeed and emphasizes the importance of treating others with respect and putting in effort at work.\n2. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's efforts to change and become a better version of themselves.\n3. Neighbors A is trying to improve their behavior at work and be a better colleague.\n4. Neighbors B appreciated Neighbors A's support during this difficult situation.\n5. Neighbors A is having issues at work, such as not pulling their weight and being rude to colleagues.\n6. Neighbors A and Neighbors B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as they enjoy having coffee and chatting together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm sorry to hear that things didn't work out at your job, but I'm glad to see that you're staying positive and focusing on your business. I truly believe that your hard work and determination will lead to success. Keep pushing forward!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about Neighbors A and B's relationship and past interactions, but it lacks specificity and connection to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While it captures the supportive nature of Neighbors B towards Neighbors A, it doesn't clearly reflect the current focus on Neighbors A's product and business ventures. The mention of work issues is somewhat connected but lacks depth in relation to the ongoing conversation about Neighbors A's job loss and business. Most sentences in MEMORY offer vague insights or are unrelated to the specific context of the DIALOGUE, reducing its overall helpfulness in generating a relevant next response."
