Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today. Wife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that. Husband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you. Wife: You always go above and beyond, dear. Husband: It's the little things that count, right? Wife: Definitely. Speaking of little things, do you remember when you told me about catching the bus just in time a few months ago? Husband: Oh yes, I remember. I was so relieved I didn't have to wait in the cold for the next one. Wife: It's amazing how small moments like that can make such a big difference in our day, isn't it? Husband: Absolutely. It's the small moments that make life worth living. Wife: And speaking of living, you mentioned a while back how involved you are in the different ministries at church. Husband: Yes, I'm so grateful for the community and support I've found there. It's helped me grow in my faith so much. Wife: It's wonderful to see you so passionate and dedicated to something you believe in. Husband: And I'm grateful for your support and encouragement in it all.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful.\n2. Husband values the supportive community of believers at church and appreciates having his wife by his side.\n3. The husband appreciates the little things in life, such as making it to the bus on time.\n4. The husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that make him happy outside of work and family life.\n5. Wife is supportive of her husband's faith journey and values having a close relationship with him.\n6. The wife is glad to see the husband finding a sense of purpose and being happy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Here's why:\n\n1. The memory accurately reflects the conversations in the dialogue context, such as the appreciation of small things (e.g., husband catching the bus just in time, both agreeing that little things make life meaningful), which is a recurring theme in their exchange.\n\n2. It captures the emotional dynamics between the husband and wife, illustrating mutual support and appreciation. For example, the husband's involvement in church activities and the wife's support of his faith journey are key elements in both the memory and dialogue.\n\n3. The sentences are clearly structured, enhancing the ability of a language model to draw connections and maintain the dialogue's cohesion when generating responses. Each element in the memory is relevant and directly connected to the elements of the dialogue context, highlighting the relationship development between the two speakers.\n\n4. While the MEMORY doesn't introduce new elements outside what's present in the context, it consolidates the existing information effectively, supporting the generation of informed and contextually appropriate responses. \n\nIn summary, the MEMORY aids in understanding the essence of the conversation, including themes of appreciation, support, faith, and the significance of small acts, making it quite helpful for generating relevant next responses. Hence, it receives a score of 4."
