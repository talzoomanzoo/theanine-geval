Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you. Classmates B: Oh really? What are they? Classmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners. Classmates B: Wow, that sounds amazing! What kind of project are you thinking about? Classmates A: I was thinking about starting a marketing agency specialized in social media. Classmates B: That's a great idea! I'd love to work with you on that. We could really make a difference in the industry. Classmates A: Yes, exactly! And I think our skills complement each other's so well. Classmates B: I totally agree. You're so creative and outgoing, while I'm more analytical and detail-oriented. Classmates A: It's like we were meant to work together, right? Classmates B: Absolutely! I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. Classmates A: Me too. And honestly, it's a bit of a relief to finally have a solid plan for the future.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n2. Classmate A and Classmate B enjoy singing karaoke together and look forward to future outings.\n3. Classmate A and Classmate B both enjoy socializing and going out to parties together.\n4. Classmate B admires Classmate A's outgoing nature and wants to be more like them.\n5. Classmate A encourages Classmate B to initiate conversations and be friendly to make new friends.\n6. Classmates A is looking forward to meeting up with Classmates B again after getting better sleep.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides a mix of relevant and less relevant information regarding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Some memory entries, such as Classmate B admiring Classmate A's outgoing nature, could be tied to the business relationship context in terms of complementing skills. Such information can help the language model understand the dynamics between the classmates and generate a more informed response. Additionally, the focus on socializing, karaoke, and parties reflects a positive and cooperative relationship that aligns with their business project aspirations. However, several entries in MEMORY like enjoying karaoke or socializing at parties are not crucial for understanding their business plans and partnership discussion in the dialogue. Thus, the memory does contain useful cues but could be more focused on directly relevant past interactions to their business plans leading to a middle score."
