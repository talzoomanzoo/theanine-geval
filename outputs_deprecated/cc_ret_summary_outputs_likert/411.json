Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today? Co-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing. Co-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed. Co-workers B: That's really nice of you, but I don't want to burden you with my work. Co-workers A: It's not a burden if it's something I can do to support you. Plus, helping you out makes me feel good too. Co-workers B: You're right, thank you. You always go above and beyond to help me out. Co-workers A: That's what co-workers are for. We're a team and we need to support each other. Co-workers B: Speaking of teamwork, remember when you showed me your plans for the future a few months ago? I'm still excited about the idea of working on a project together. Co-workers A: Me too! I think we would make a great business partnership. Co-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have someone I can trust and rely on in both work and personal matters. Co-workers A: I agree. We have a good working dynamic and I'm happy to help out whenever I can.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\n2. Co-worker B is impressed with Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership.\n3. Co-worker A feels motivated about the future and is excited to work with Co-worker B.\n4. Co-worker B is glad to have been able to help Co-worker A and feels the trade worked out well for both of them.\n5. Co-workers A and B have a positive and optimistic attitude towards their future collaboration.\n6. Co-worker B agrees that their skill sets complement each other well.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, mainly focusing on the collaboration and supportive dynamic between Co-worker A and Co-worker B. For example, sentences 2 and 5 correspond with the dialogue's content regarding enthusiasm for future collaboration. However, the MEMORY contains a few inaccuracies and missing elements such as the role reversal in sentence 1, where Co-worker A is the one offering help. Moreover, sentence 4 seems unrelated or unclear in terms of context as the 'trade' is not mentioned. The MEMORY could be phrased more clearly to highlight the causality and development in their interactions. While the overall sentiment of support and collaboration is captured, the natural connection and alignment with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT are not fully established."
