    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful. Co-workers B: Did you make sure to include all the necessary details? Co-workers A: Yes, I made sure to cover everything we talked about in the meeting. I even added some extra information that I thought could be useful.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B finished a project and sent it to the manager for review.\n2. Co-worker A believes the project will be approved with flying colors.\n3. Co-worker B appreciates the pen and thanks Co-worker A for the gesture.\n4. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a thoughtful gesture.\n5. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen that they still use.\n6. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value trust in their personal and professional relationships.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided is not directly helpful for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around Co-worker A submitting a written report to the boss, while the MEMORY primarily discusses other unrelated interactions, such as the exchange of a pen and general sentiments about trust. None of the sentences in MEMORY offer relevant information or connections to the dialogue context specifically about the report or past meetings. The sentences are mostly standalone and do not contribute to understanding the development of the current topic discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, they do not aid in predicting or informing the conversation further."
