    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message. Co-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident. Co-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs.\n2. Co-worker A agrees to be more conscious of how they come across to others in the future.\n3. Co-worker A has experience dealing with challenging clients and emphasizes the importance of communication and setting expectations.\n4. Co-worker B is supportive and interested in the evidence collected by Co-worker A.\n5. Co-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\n6. Co-worker A is a skilled builder who recently completed building a house for Co-worker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! It really does show in your interactions with others. Your confidence and ability to connect with people definitely shine through.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides limited helpful information for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 3 may be of some relevance, as they touch on the topic of communication, which could be connected to public speaking. However, most of the sentences in MEMORY do not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about public speaking and its impact, therefore not adding much to the development of the conversation. Moreover, the phrases are somewhat disjointed without clear connections indicating causality or the development of events between the interactions. As such, they do not strongly aid the language model in identifying important contextual cues."
