Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend! Co-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang. Co-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while. Co-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing? Co-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites. Co-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice. Co-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it. Co-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent. Co-workers A: Thanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together.\n2. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n3. Co-worker A and Co-worker B are both excited about payday and being able to pay off bills.\n4. Co-worker A has a talent for solving puzzles and mysteries.\n5. Co-worker A and Co-worker B were able to pay their bills on time when working at the clothing store.\n6. Co-worker B is married and had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You should definitely sing more often. It's great to see you doing something you love.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides limited helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The details in the memory do not align well with the discussion about Co-worker A's singing at church. Most points in the MEMORY are irrelevant to the topic at hand, such as bill-paying, marriage, and hiking. While these details might be part of the overarching background of the co-workers, they do not directly support or enhance the specific conversational thread about singing or music. Additionally, the MEMORY lacks coherence and connection that would indicate past interactions directly related to the current dialogue. As such, the MEMORY receives a score of 2 for its lack of relevance and connection to the specific conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
