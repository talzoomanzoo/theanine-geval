Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret? Neighbors B: Of course, what's up? Neighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and B joke about the fun aspects of using telekinesis to surprise people.\n2. Neighbors B is excited and supportive of Neighbors A's new ability.\n3. Neighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation.\n4. Neighbors B expresses concerns about accidentally moving objects and causing unintended consequences.\n5. Neighbors A and B are discussing the idea of having telekinetic abilities.\n6. Neighbors A has gained the ability to move objects with their mind.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some limited context that could be tentatively linked to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically regarding the theme of secrecy or hiding something unusual (telekinesis). However, most of the sentences in the MEMORY focus on telekinesis, which appears unrelated to the situation at hand, where Neighbors A is hiding from their mom. While the MEMORY illustrates some aspects of Neighbors A and B's past interactions related to telekinesis and cooking, it lacks a direct connection or causality related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about hiding and keeping a secret. The information is not directly relevant, and issues such as accidental object movements, cooking interests, or the novelty of telekinetic powers donâ€™t provide immediate helpful clues for responding to the secretive nature of the dialogue. Therefore, the overall utility in aiding the language model to derive an appropriate next response is minimal."
