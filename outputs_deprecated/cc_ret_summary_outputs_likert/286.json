Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away. Co-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that. Co-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way. Co-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you. Co-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it. Co-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on. Co-workers A: I know you're right, Co-workers B. I just don't know how to get over this feeling.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n3. Co-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity.\n4. Co-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\n5. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's positivity and friendship.\n6. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information related to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly in sentence 1 where Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty, which is directly mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the rest of the sentences in MEMORY do not highlight key elements or developments from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT involving the critical issue of Co-worker A's dilemma with their feelings towards the bride. While sentences 3, 5, and 6 relate to the personalities and dynamics between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, they do not aid in generating a response to the current conversation about the bride situation. Therefore, the MEMORY lacks information that is necessary to helpfully inform the specific dialogue about the obsession and ethical discussion. The disconnection between most of the MEMORY's content and the current context results in a lower usefulness score, though sentence 1 does provide some relevant connections."
