Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on. Child: What is it, Parent? Parent: I created a website where I post advertisements, and people can pay to see them.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Child is caring and offers help to the Parent.\n2. The parent and child have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores.\n3. The Parent is working and feels tired after a long day.\n4. The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings.\n5. The Child supports the idea of the Parent adopting more children and hopes for a happy home for them.\n6. The Child offers to bring water or make soup for the Parent while they are resting.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT in terms of the communication dynamic between the Parent and Child. Specifically, points 1 and 2 describe the childâ€™s caring nature and the open communication they share, which are relevant to shaping an appropriate response from the Child in the dialogue context. However, the MEMORY also includes information that is not directly applicable to the current dialogue, such as discussions about household chores, adopting more children, and details about the Parent's fatigue. While these details are naturally phrased and give context to the relationship, they are less relevant for generating a direct continuation from the current context focused on the Parent's project. The MEMORY embodies a balance of relevance and broader relationship context, leading to a mid-level score on the helpfulness scale."
