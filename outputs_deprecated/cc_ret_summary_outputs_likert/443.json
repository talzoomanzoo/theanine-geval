Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria. Co-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking? Co-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you? Co-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you. Co-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago? Co-workers B: Yeah, I remember that conversation. What about it? Co-workers A: Well, I wanted to share some good news with you. I've been recently promoted to the night shift and have been doing a great job. I think I've come a long way since those days. Co-workers B: That's awesome, congratulations! I'm proud of you and all the hard work you've put in. You've definitely grown and matured in the workplace. Co-workers A: Thank you, I appreciate that. But I have to admit, I'm still a bit nervous about being wrong. Remember when we talked about my constantly questioning myself and second-guessing my decisions? Co-workers B: Yeah, I remember that. Is there anything specific that's been bothering you? Co-workers A: Not really, it's just a general feeling of uncertainty at times. But hey, speaking of uncertainty, do you remember when we talked about my love for singing a while ago?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n2. Co-worker A expresses nervousness and self-doubt despite their achievements.\n3. Co-worker B reminds Co-worker A of their progress and potential for success.\n4. Co-worker B has moved on from their arrest and appreciates Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior.\n5. Co-worker A is nervous about making mistakes in their new position.\n6. Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I remember that conversation about your passion for singing. It's great to see you pursuing your interests outside of work. I'm sure your talent and dedication will shine through, just like they have in your career growth. Keep pushing yourself and don't be afraid to make mistakes along the way. You've got this!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Most of the sentences in MEMORY are directly relevant to the dialogue, capturing the essence of the conversation about Co-worker A's achievements, self-doubt, and being reassured by Co-worker B. It highlights Co-worker B's supportive nature, which is important for the ongoing dialogue. However, one sentence (4) appears to introduce a new, unrelated context that is not mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, pertaining to Co-worker B's arrest, which slightly affects the overall cohesion. Nevertheless, most of the MEMORY is naturally connected, and provides a useful summary of the interactions between the speakers."
