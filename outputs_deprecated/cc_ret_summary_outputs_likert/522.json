Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Wife suggests that husband should try using more modern language to be better understood.\n2. Wife brings up Sarah, the husband's previous partner, but husband says he hasn't thought about her much.\n3. The husband is open to learning more about movies, showing a willingness to try again.\n4. Husband agrees to try adapting to modern language for better communication with his wife.\n5. Both the husband and wife express a desire for happiness and understanding in the situation.\n6. The husband claims to have a real connection with Sarah and wants to find a way to move forward while still considering his current marriage.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Maybe you could try exploring different genres or writing styles to spark some inspiration. Remember, sometimes stepping out of your comfort zone can lead to great creativity.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some potentially relevant information pertaining to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 4 discuss the husband's interest in adapting modern language, which might be related to his struggle in finding new ideas for his writing. Sentence 5 highlights a mutual desire for happiness and understanding, which could inform the language model about the tone or intent behind future interactions. Sentence 3 shows the husband's openness to learning, which could be tied to exploring new ideas in his writing. However, sentences 2 and 6, which involve the husband's previous partner Sarah, might not directly contribute to his current writing issues. While the MEMORY offers some useful context, it contains information that is not directly applicable, and it does not demonstrate very strong causality or connection specifically related to the context of feeling stuck with writing. Therefore, the MEMORY merits a mid-level score for helpfulness."
