    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins. Neighbors B: Oh, okay. I didn't realize there was any confusion about that. Neighbors A: Well, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page. I don't want any misunderstandings in the future.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both neighbors emphasize the importance of taking care of each other as neighbors.\n2. Neighbors B offers to be more supportive and check in on Neighbors A more often.\n3. Neighbor A and Neighbor B went to a concert together in the past and had a great time.\n4. Neighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B.\n5. Neighbor B enjoys listening to Neighbor A read and is interested in reading more.\n6. Neighbors A offers to help Neighbors B with getting into a workout routine.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's thoughtful of you, Neighbor A. I appreciate your proactive approach to avoid any potential issues. It's important for us to have clear boundaries. And hey, I'm glad we're both open to communicating openly and honestly.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY includes several points about the relationship between Neighbors A and B, such as taking care of each other, past social interactions (concert), and shared interests (reading, workout). However, these points do not directly address the current context of discussing property boundaries. While the MEMORY provides some background on the neighbors' relationship, it lacks information relevant to clarifying the property line issue discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences are naturally phrased but lack clear development or direct connection to the current context, making it a bit challenging to generate a contextually appropriate next response."
