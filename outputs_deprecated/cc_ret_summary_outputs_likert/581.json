    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become? Neighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out? Neighbors A: Yes, I go to the gym every day and lift weights. It's been really helping me build muscle. Neighbors B: That's great to hear! It reminds me of the time when you apologized to me for the way you treated me. Neighbors A: Yes, I realized that I needed to take responsibility for my actions and I didn't want to make the same mistake again. Neighbors B: It's always important to own up to our mistakes. It's like when you forgot your backpack in high school and had to deal with the consequences.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B reminds Neighbors A about taking responsibility for their mistakes in the past and learning from them.\n2. Neighbors A apologized to Neighbors B for their behavior and admitted to being wrong.\n3. Neighbor A apologized to Neighbor B for their behavior and expressed a desire to make amends.\n4. Neighbor B accepted Neighbor A's apology and mentioned that it was hurtful to be treated that way.\n5. Neighbors B offers help and support to Neighbors A in the situation.\n6. Neighbor A values their friendship with Neighbor B and wants to ensure it remains strong.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You're right, I definitely learned my lesson from that experience. It's all about growing and improving as a person. Thank you for being understanding and supportive through it all.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that is helpful for generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1-4 in the MEMORY connect well with the context of neighbors discussing responsibility for past actions and apologies, which is explicitly mentioned in the dialogue. These sentences summarize previous interactions between the neighbors related to apologies and personal growth, thereby reinforcing the continuity in their relationship and conversation. Sentence 5, although not directly referenced in the context, implies a supportive relationship that fits within the established dialogue. Sentence 6 adds additional depth by highlighting the value Neighbor A places on their friendship, which aligns with the positive note of reconciliation in the context. Overall, the MEMORY effectively captures the essence of past interactions that are meaningful for understanding the dynamics between the speakers, making it quite helpful."
