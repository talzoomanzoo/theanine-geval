    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message. Co-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident. Co-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows. Co-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A plans to present the evidence clearly and persuasively in court.\n2. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument.\n3. Co-worker A has presented evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past.\n4. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs.\n5. Co-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\n6. Co-worker B is supportive and interested in the evidence collected by Co-worker A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate your kind words. It means a lot to me that you find my arguments compelling. I always strive to present my evidence clearly and persuasively to make a strong case.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains several key pieces of information that can help generate a relevant next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Each memory sentence offers helpful contextual details that pertain to Co-worker A's presentation skills and past interactions around speaking and debating. There is a natural connection between the shared memories and discussion of public speaking and presenting evidence. However, while the information is useful, there is some repetition in the ideas presented in the memory (e.g., presenting evidence persuasively). Therefore, the memory could be slightly refined for optimal clarity and uniqueness in content."
