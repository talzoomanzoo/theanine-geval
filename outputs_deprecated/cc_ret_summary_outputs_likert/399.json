    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing! Neighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go? Neighbors A: I visited Brazil and Peru. The culture and food were incredible. Neighbors B: That sounds awesome. I've always wanted to go to Peru to see Machu Picchu. Neighbors A: Yes, Machu Picchu is amazing. The view from the top is breathtaking. Neighbors B: Have you thought about where you want to go next? Neighbors A: Yeah, I'm thinking about visiting Australia and Antarctica next. I want to see the Great Barrier Reef and the penguins. Neighbors B: Wow, that's quite a contrast. From the hot desert to the cold ice. It must be interesting to experience such different environments. Neighbors A: Definitely, that's what I love about traveling. You get to see and experience so much diversity in the world.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and B believe in doing nice things for others to bring the community together.\n2. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's organization skills and wishes to improve their own organization.\n3. Both Neighbors A and B believe in the importance of learning and self-improvement.\n4. Neighbors A and B both took a cooking class together last year.\n5. Neighbor B suggests finding other ways to relieve frustration and looking out for Neighbor A's well-being.\n6. Neighbors B agrees that being organized could help them improve in their work and hobbies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's great that you enjoy exploring different environments and cultures. It's such a valuable way to learn and grow. Have you considered taking a cooking class in one of those destinations? It could be a fun way to immerse yourself in the local culture even more.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some information about Neighbors A and B's previous interactions, but it lacks direct relevance to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on travel experiences and future travel plans. The MEMORY entries provide insight into their beliefs about community, organization skills, self-improvement, and past activities like taking a cooking class together. However, these details do not provide significant contextual cues for generating a next response related to the dialogue about travel. The connections between MEMORY and DIALOGUE CONTEXT are weak, resulting in a low helpfulness score. The information is mostly disjointed from the current conversation topic, thus making it less useful for aiding in the generation of an appropriate response."
