Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you. Classmates B: Oh really? What are they? Classmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners. Classmates B: Wow, that sounds amazing! What kind of project are you thinking about? Classmates A: I was thinking about starting a marketing agency specialized in social media. Classmates B: That's a great idea! I'd love to work with you on that. We could really make a difference in the industry. Classmates A: Yes, exactly! And I think our skills complement each other's so well. Classmates B: I totally agree. You're so creative and outgoing, while I'm more analytical and detail-oriented. Classmates A: It's like we were meant to work together, right? Classmates B: Absolutely! I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. Classmates A: Me too. And honestly, it's a bit of a relief to finally have a solid plan for the future. Classmates B: Yeah, I get that. Speaking of the future, how have you been doing with your sleeping problems?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A is looking forward to meeting up with Classmates B again after getting better sleep.\n2. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n3. Classmate A and Classmate B both enjoy socializing and going out to parties together.\n4. Classmate A and Classmate B enjoy singing karaoke together and look forward to future outings.\n5.

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks for asking! I've actually been feeling so much better lately. I've been getting more restful sleep and I can already feel a difference in my mood and energy levels. It's amazing what a good night's sleep can do for you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does provide some relevant information that can assist in generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it mentions Classmates A's sleeping problems, which connects to Classmates B's question in the dialogue about those issues. Additionally, it shows a supportive dynamic, with both classmates encouraging each other towards a better future, which ties into the partnership discussion. However, the MEMORY also contains details that are less relevant to the main discussion about their future plans, such as their enjoyment of social activities together like parties and karaoke, and their openness to meeting for coffee. These points are not directly related to the business idea or their skillset complementarity. Overall, the MEMORY presents some helpful context but also includes tangential details that don't directly support the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, thus earning a mid-range score."
