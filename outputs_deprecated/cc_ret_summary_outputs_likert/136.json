Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that. Neighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset? Neighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore. Neighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it? Neighbors A: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end job.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\n2. Neighbors A and B live in the same neighborhood and help each other with tasks.\n3. Neighbors A and B are helpful towards each other.\n4. Neighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship as neighbors.\n5. Neighbors B recalls when Neighbors A helped with their lawn, showing mutual support between them.\n6. Neighbors A is detail-oriented and strives for perfection.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information that could help the language model generate a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, points 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 highlight the supportive and positive relationship between the neighbors, which aligns with Neighbors B's understanding and supportive response in the context. The MEMORY provides context about their mutual helpfulness and past interactions, which could inform Unknown's response to maintain a tone of support and understanding. However, point 6 about Neighbors A being detail-oriented and striving for perfection is not relevant to the specific context of Neighbors A's work frustration, and it does not contribute to the contextual flow of the conversation. Additionally, the MEMORY lacks detailed development of past interactions specific to the work situation discussed, which limits its usefulness. As a result, while some parts of the MEMORY are relevant, it is not consistently helpful or aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT to warrant a higher score."
