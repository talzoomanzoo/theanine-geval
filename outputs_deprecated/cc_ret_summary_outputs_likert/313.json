Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway? Wife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go? Husband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city. Wife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change. Husband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think? Wife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband has long-awaited plans and is finally taking action on them.\n2. The wife offers her support and encouragement to the husband in his journey towards achieving his dreams.\n3. The husband is excited about his progress on long-awaited plans and is putting in a lot of effort to make them a reality.\n4. The wife supports the husband's goals but wanted to be involved in them.\n5. The husband is inspired by his wife to take action on his dreams and goals.\n6. The husband apologized and promised to involve the wife in his plans in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains information that indicates the husband's goals and the wife's support, which loosely connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where the husband proposes a getaway. However, most of the MEMORY details are either irrelevant or not directly tied to the dialogue. For instance, mentions of \"long-awaited plans\" or \"achieving dreams\" lack clear relevance to the weekend getaway plan discussed in the dialogue. Additionally, the causality and connection between the sentences are not clearly demonstrated, making it difficult for a language model to effectively utilize them to generate a contextually appropriate response for the given dialogue. Furthermore, the MEMORY does not provide enough specific details about the interaction dynamics related to planning a getaway, which could have been more supportive in generating a proper next response."
