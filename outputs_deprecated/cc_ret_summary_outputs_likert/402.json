Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today? Co-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A now has a good job and is doing well, despite their difficult upbringing.\n2. Co-worker B is supportive and glad that Co-worker A is okay.\n3. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health.\n4. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\n5. Co-worker A values their health to continue working at their best.\n6. Co-worker A feels motivated about the future and is excited to work with Co-worker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful and relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Co-worker B's supportive nature is emphasized multiple times, and this aligns with their response in the dialogue context of managing a heavy workload. The MEMORY elaborates on Co-worker B's supportive actions, which would allow a language model to generate responses that reflect Co-worker B's character and relationship with Co-worker A. Additionally, it captures Co-worker A's motivation and value for health, which can be a part of more dynamic interactions. While some sentences are perhaps reiterative, they are naturally phrased and cohesive enough to be identified as contextual cues that support the ongoing dialogue or might influence future interactions between the two co-workers."
