    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing! Neighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go? Neighbors A: I visited Brazil and Peru. The culture and food were incredible. Neighbors B: That sounds awesome. I've always wanted to go to Peru to see Machu Picchu. Neighbors A: Yes, Machu Picchu is amazing. The view from the top is breathtaking. Neighbors B: Have you thought about where you want to go next?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's organization skills and wishes to improve their own organization.\n2. Neighbors A and B believe in doing nice things for others to bring the community together.\n3. Both Neighbors A and B believe in the importance of learning and self-improvement.\n4. Neighbors A and B both took a cooking class together last year.\n5. Neighbor B suggests finding other ways to relieve frustration and looking out for Neighbor A's well-being.\n6. Neighbor A is feeling frustrated and is considering going to a bar to find someone for a casual encounter.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY details do not provide information that is directly helpful for generating a relevant next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around a recent trip to South America, specifically discussing destinations visited, the experience of Machu Picchu, and potential future travel plans. The MEMORY fails to provide information relevant to travel experiences or future travel plans. Instead, it offers insights into the personal characteristics of Neighbors A and B (like organization skills, valuing community, and learning), a shared cooking class experience, and Neighbor A's unrelated frustrations. While some sentences are naturally structured, they do not connect directly with the ongoing conversation. The link between MEMORY and dialogue context is weak, which limits its helpfulness for guiding the next response."
