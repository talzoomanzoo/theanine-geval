    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I really enjoy being a carpenter. It's a very fulfilling job. Classmates B: That's great to hear! How did you get into carpentry? Classmates A: My dad was a carpenter, so I grew up around it. I started by helping him out when I was young, and then I began to really enjoy it myself.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate B is supportive and encourages Classmate A to pursue their dream.\n2. Classmates A appreciates the support and encouragement from Classmates B.\n3. Classmates A is attending a seminar on starting a business and is excited about applying that knowledge to future plans.\n4. Classmates B is supportive and encourages Classmates A in their business venture.\n5. Classmate B offers to support and potentially collaborate with Classmate A in the future.\n6. Classmates A is willing to work hard and learn the necessary strategies for business success.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's wonderful that you found something you're passionate about and have a strong foundation in. Have you ever thought about starting your own carpentry business?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures the supportive nature of Classmate B and Classmate A's appreciation of this support, which is consistent with the dialog where Classmate B is curious and approving of Classmate A's carpenter background. The MEMORY also includes details about Classmate A's interests in starting a business, which can be connected to the context of pursuing carpentry as a fulfilling job and potentially as a business venture. These details help in understanding the relational dynamics and aspirations between the classmates, thus enabling the language model to generate a response that aligns with the encouragement and entrepreneurial spirit captured in their interactions. Overall, the developmental and supportive themes in the MEMORY are well-structured and relevant, making it beneficial for generating a coherent continuation of the conversation."
