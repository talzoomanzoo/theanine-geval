    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend! Co-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang. Co-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while. Co-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing? Co-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together.\n2. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n3. Co-worker A and Co-worker B used to work together at a clothing store.\n4. Co-worker B is married and had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends.\n5. Co-worker A and Co-worker B were able to pay their bills on time when working at the clothing store.\n6. Co-worker A and Co-worker B are both excited about payday and being able to pay off bills.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's such a beautiful song. I bet you sounded amazing singing it. I'm glad you got the chance to share your talent with everyone at church.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information about the past interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, such as their time working together at a clothing store and their shared happy memories. However, the MEMORY does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around Co-worker A singing a solo at church. The MEMORY lacks specific information or context about singing, music, or personal interests outside of work that could directly help generate a relevant response to the current conversation. The sentences in MEMORY are loosely connected to show their past working relationship, but these details are not particularly helpful for understanding or expanding on the topic being discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
