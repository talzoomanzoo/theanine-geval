Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind? Classmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you. Classmates B: Oh, really?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A tends to overthink things and appreciated Classmates B's support and advice.\n2. Classmates A discovered a secret that Classmates B has been keeping.\n3. Classmates A and B are students in the same class.\n4. Classmates A and B are close and have a level of trust between them.\n5. Classmates A was worried about a situation but it turned out to be not a big deal.\n6. Classmates A and B have had a previous positive interaction in a coffee shop where Classmates A rubbed Classmates B's neck, providing relaxation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, I know it may sound strange, but I just wanted to let you know that I appreciate your support and advice. It means a lot to me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides several key pieces of information that contribute to understanding the dialogue context. Firstly, the memory indicates that Classmates A and B have a close, trusting relationship which is relevant given Classmates A's admission of being unable to stop thinking about Classmates B – this suggests a deeper connection and potentially emotional involvement. The memory of Classmates A's tendency to overthink and the appreciation of Classmates B's advice and support suggests that Classmates B's response might take into account this predisposition. The context of their previous positive interaction and the neck rubbing for relaxation at a coffee shop provides background that might inform how Classmates B responds to Classmates A's emotional admission.\n\nWhile the secret Classmates A discovered is mentioned, its relevance to the current situation isn't directly clear, and thus its helpfulness is limited in this specific context. However, most of the sentences in the MEMORY do contain relevant information that is naturally connected and could aid in generating an appropriate next response, providing useful context for the situation presented in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
