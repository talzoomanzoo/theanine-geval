Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm really excited about finding a buyer for my product. I think it has a lot of potential. Neighbors B: That's great to hear, what kind of product is it? Neighbors A: It's a new type of workout equipment that's designed to be more efficient than traditional equipment. I've been working on it for months now and I really think it's going to take off. Neighbors B: Wow, that sounds interesting. Have you started looking for potential buyers? Neighbors A: Yes, I've been reaching out to various gyms and fitness centers to see if they'd be interested in carrying the product. I've even gotten some positive feedback from a few places. Neighbors B: That's awesome! I'm sure with your determination, you'll find the perfect buyer soon. Neighbors A: Thanks, I really appreciate your support. It's been a long road, but I'm confident that all my hard work will pay off. Neighbors B: Speaking of hard work, have you made any progress at your current job? I remember you were having some trouble with your boss. Neighbors A: Yeah, unfortunately things didn't work out and I was let go. But I'm trying to look at it as an opportunity to focus on my own business ventures. Neighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm glad you're pursuing your passion. And hey, at least you won't have to deal with that unpleasant boss anymore.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B expresses a desire for Neighbors A to succeed and emphasizes the importance of treating others with respect and putting in effort at work.\n2. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's efforts to change and become a better version of themselves.\n3. Neighbors A is trying to improve their behavior at work and be a better colleague.\n4. Neighbors B appreciated Neighbors A's support during this difficult situation.\n5. Neighbors A and Neighbors B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as they enjoy having coffee and chatting together.\n6. Neighbors A is having issues at work, such as not pulling their weight and being rude to colleagues.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, that's true. I'm looking forward to a fresh start and putting all my energy into my new business. Thanks for always being so supportive, it means a lot to me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context that is related and can be useful for generating the next response, although it could be improved for clarity and direct relevance. The MEMORY reveals that Neighbors B is supportive and wishes Neighbors A to succeed, which aligns with the encouragement shown in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This supportive relationship is evident in the context where Neighbor B is supportive of Neighbor A's business endeavors. \n\nAdditionally, the MEMORY highlights the issues Neighbors A faced at work, which aligns with the conversation where Neighbors A mentioned being let go and are looking at it as a new opportunity. This provides a richer background on Neighbor A's struggles with their previous job, which explains why they are focusing more on their product now.\n\nHowever, some parts of the MEMORY are not as directly relevant or phrased in a way that clearly develops the context, such as the emphasis on treating others with respect and putting in effort at work, which is a bit peripheral in the context of the product discussion.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides a moderate level of context to aid the language model but could benefit from tighter focus and phrasing more directly connected to the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
