Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind? Classmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you. Classmates B: Oh, really? Classmates A: Yes, really. I know we've been friends for a while now, but I feel like there may be something more between us. Classmates B: Hmm, I never thought about it that way. But I can’t deny that we have a great connection.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B are close and have a level of trust between them.\n2. Classmates A tends to overthink things and appreciated Classmates B's support and advice.\n3. Classmates A discovered a secret that Classmates B has been keeping.\n4. Classmates A and B have had a previous positive interaction in a coffee shop where Classmates A rubbed Classmates B's neck, providing relaxation.\n5. Classmates A and B are students in the same class.\n6. Classmates A had doubts about trusting Classmates B due to rumors about their reliability.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that can help the language model generate a proper next response. It outlines the background of Classmates A and B having a close relationship and trust, which aligns with the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Classmates A expresses feelings for Classmates B and acknowledges their connection. The mention of Classmates A's tendency to overthink things and the appreciation of Classmates B's support could be useful to understand Classmates A's thought process in confessing feelings. The previous positive interaction in a coffee shop adds another layer of understanding to their relationship dynamics. However, the mention of Classmates A's doubts due to rumors about Classmates B adds a potential tension that is not directly relevant but could be useful should this context arise in future interactions. Overall, the MEMORY is mostly beneficial, but some parts like discovering a secret are not directly useful for the specific dialogue context but are still well-structured."
