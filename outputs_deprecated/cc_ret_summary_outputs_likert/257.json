Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going? Neighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you? Neighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band. Neighbors B: Really? You had a band? Neighbors A: Yeah, we were called \"The Neighbors A Band.\" We used to play live shows around the city. Neighbors B: That's awesome! What kind of music did you guys play? Neighbors A: We played rock music, mostly covers but we also wrote some of our own songs. Neighbors B: Have you ever thought about starting the band again? Neighbors A: Not really, it was just a fun hobby back then. Plus, I don't think I have the same energy as I did when I was younger. Neighbors B: That's understandable. Do you still play any instruments? Neighbors A: I have a guitar but I haven't played it in a while. Maybe I should start practicing again. Neighbors B: Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Maybe you could even teach me a thing or two.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A looks forward to playing with Neighbors B again when feeling better.\n2. Neighbors A and Neighbors B enjoy playing together with toys.\n3. Neighbors B is familiar with Neighbors A's dog and looking forward to playing with it again.\n4. Neighbors A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbors B.\n5. Neighbor B is interested in chiropractic care after hearing about Neighbor A's positive experience.\n6. Neighbors B expresses concern for Neighbors A's back pain.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided consists of several statements about Neighbors A and B's interactions, but they do not directly relate to or enhance the understanding of the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Neighbor A's past experience with a rock band and playing music. Some sentences involve playing with toys, familiarity with a dog, and aspects of chiropractic care, and while these illustrate some form of previous interactions, they are not particularly helpful in generating a relevant and coherent response based on the current dialogue. The sentences lack cohesiveness and a clear connection to the context of music and bands, thus limiting their relevance and usefulness in this situation."
