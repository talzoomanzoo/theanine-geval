Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn. Teacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation? Student: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle. Teacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time? Student: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then. Teacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The teacher and student have a positive and understanding relationship.\n2. The student is studying French at college and plans on learning Spanish and German as well.\n3. The student mentioned feeling stressed lately, which may have led to the outburst.\n4. The teacher expressed understanding and encouraged the student to seek help when needed.\n5. The teacher speaks Spanish and French fluently.\n6. The teacher advises the student on effective communication and problem-solving, emphasizing the importance of talking calmly and finding solutions together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been enjoying learning French so far, but I can't wait to start Spanish and German as well. It's going to be a challenge, but I'm excited to expand my language skills.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides pertinent information about the student and teacher's relationship, which is positive and understanding (1). This context helps Unknown generate appropriate supportive dialogue. The MEMORY also mentions the student's language studies (2), which is relevant to the teacher's question about language studying. Additionally, the student's stress (3) and the teacher's encouragement to seek help (4) could contextually inform Unknown about underlying issues affecting the student's current mood or responses. However, details like the teacher's fluency in Spanish and French (5) and advice on communication (6) are less immediately relevant to the direct DIALOGUE CONTEXT. They don't necessarily contribute causally or developmentally to the immediate conversation about hot sauce and building tolerance. Overall, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful, but it's not directly and fully aligned with the current dialogue flow."
