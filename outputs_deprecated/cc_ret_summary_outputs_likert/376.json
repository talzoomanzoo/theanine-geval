Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B are students in the same class.\n2. Classmates A offered help and support to Classmates B.\n3. Classmates A tends to overthink things and appreciated Classmates B's support and advice.\n4. Classmates A and B are close and have a level of trust between them.\n5. Classmates A was worried about a situation but it turned out to be not a big deal.\n6. Classmates A and B are working on a group project together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provided is quite helpful in generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives a good overview of the relationship and dynamics between Classmates A and B, who are students in the same class. It highlights key aspects such as their closeness, the history of offering help and support, and the fact that they are working on a group project together. This information can inform Unknown's response in a meaningful way by leveraging the trust and collaboration that exists between the classmates. The MEMORY is structured naturally, with statements that reflect specific past interactions, emotional states, and situational contexts that may inform what Classmates A wanted to discuss in the dialogue. However, it does include some extraneous information that may not be directly related to the current conversation, hence the score is not a perfect 5."
