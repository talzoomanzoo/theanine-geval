Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you. Classmates B: Oh really? What are they?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n2. Classmate A and Classmate B enjoy singing karaoke together and look forward to future outings.\n3. Classmate A and Classmate B both enjoy socializing and going out to parties together.\n4. Classmates A is social and enjoys meeting new people.\n5. Classmates A is looking forward to meeting up with Classmates B again after getting better sleep.\n6. Classmate B admires Classmate A's outgoing nature and wants to be more like them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful context for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Several sentences in the MEMORY highlight the positive and supportive relationship between Classmates A and B, which aligns with the context of Classmates A wanting to share exciting plans with Classmates B. Sentences such as \"Classmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future\" and \"Classmate B admires Classmate A's outgoing nature and wants to be more like them\" suggest that Classmate B is likely to be interested and supportive of Classmate A's plans. Additionally, the mention of shared activities like karaoke and socializing together suggests a close bond, indicating that Classmate B would be receptive to the plans Classmate A wishes to share. While not all entries directly relate to the topic of future plans, the overall positive dynamic depicted is relevant and aids in generating a supportive response. Therefore, the MEMORY gets a score of 4 for providing beneficial context that can influence the tone and content of the response."
