    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm really excited about finding a buyer for my product. I think it has a lot of potential. Neighbors B: That's great to hear, what kind of product is it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and Neighbors B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as they enjoy having coffee and chatting together.\n2. Neighbors B expresses a desire for Neighbors A to succeed and emphasizes the importance of treating others with respect and putting in effort at work.\n3. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's efforts to change and become a better version of themselves.\n4. Neighbors B appreciated Neighbors A's support during this difficult situation.\n5. Neighbors A is trying to improve their behavior at work and be a better colleague.\n6. Neighbors A reassured Neighbors B that they had nothing to do with the dog's disappearance.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's a new line of handmade candles with unique scents. I've been working hard on perfecting the formulas.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided gives some insights into the relationship between Neighbors A and Neighbors B, indicating a level of friendliness and support. This is somewhat helpful in understanding the general tone and dynamic between the two speakers in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly Neighbors B's supportive nature which might be reflected in their response to Neighbors A's excitement about their product. However, the MEMORY lacks detailed information directly related to the product and doesn't contain highly specific insights that would strongly inform the next response about the product discussion. The sentences are naturally phrased and give a broad sense of the relationship, which is useful, but the relevance to the specific dialogue about the product is limited."
