Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria. Co-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking? Co-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you? Co-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you. Co-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago? Co-workers B: Yeah, I remember that conversation. What about it? Co-workers A: Well, I wanted to share some good news with you. I've been recently promoted to the night shift and have been doing a great job. I think I've come a long way since those days. Co-workers B: That's awesome, congratulations! I'm proud of you and all the hard work you've put in. You've definitely grown and matured in the workplace. Co-workers A: Thank you, I appreciate that. But I have to admit, I'm still a bit nervous about being wrong. Remember when we talked about my constantly questioning myself and second-guessing my decisions? Co-workers B: Yeah, I remember that. Is there anything specific that's been bothering you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n2. Co-worker A expresses nervousness and self-doubt despite their achievements.\n3. Co-worker B reminds Co-worker A of their progress and potential for success.\n4. Co-worker B has moved on from their arrest and appreciates Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior.\n5. Co-worker A is nervous about making mistakes in their new position.\n6. Co-worker A has made mistakes in the past but is trying to be more aware of their actions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY is highly relevant and helpful in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides a clear summary of important past interactions and emotions shared between Co-worker A and Co-worker B. It captures Co-worker A's journey from being seen as irresponsible to receiving a promotion and still feeling nervous about making mistakes, which matches the conversation in the context. Co-worker B's supportive role and reminders of Co-worker A's progress are also highlighted in the MEMORY. Moreover, the concern and encouragement from Co-worker B towards Co-worker A's self-doubt are presented in a clear and structured manner. This allows the language model to easily pick up on the important emotional and supportive cues necessary to generate a continuation of the conversation. The mentions of Co-worker B moving on from their arrest provide a naturally phrased context about their past interactions, even though it slightly diverges from the current topic, it adds depth to the overall memory. Overall, the MEMORY provides a complete, concise, and well-structured summary of the relevant information, fulfilling the criteria for a maximum helpfulness score."
