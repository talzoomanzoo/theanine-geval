Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life. Child: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you. Parent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you. Child: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you? Parent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The child is supportive and caring towards the parent.\n3. The child is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes.\n4. The child offers help and reassurance to the parent.\n5. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n6. Both the parent and child express love and support for each other.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that can help the language model generate a response in line with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context emphasizes the importance of listening, particularly in difficult situations, and the MEMORY supports this by highlighting the child's supportive and caring nature towards the parent. Additionally, the MEMORY communicates that the parent's experiences led to positive changes and the child's pride in those changes. The MEMORY captures the emotional undercurrent of support and encouragement exchanged between the parent and child, which is significant to understanding their interactions. However, though naturally phrased, the specific connection each memory point has to the current dialog context isn't immediately clear. A direct connection to the subject of listening could improve the coherence. Nonetheless, the overall sentiment and portrayal of their relationship are in line with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making the MEMORY helpful for generating a coherent and contextually suitable next response."
