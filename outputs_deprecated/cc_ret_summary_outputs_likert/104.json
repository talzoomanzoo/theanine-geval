    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager! Co-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role. Co-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge. Co-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail. Co-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.

Co-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality. Co-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes.

Co-workers A: We definitely did. And it taught me to just take things one step at a time, like I am with this new role. Co-workers B: Exactly, and I'm sure you'll apply that same mentality to your training as well. I remember you were really dedicated to it a couple of years ago. Co-workers A: Oh yeah, I still try to keep up with it whenever I can. It's important to stay physically and mentally fit, especially with this new job. Co-workers B: Just don't let your anger get the better of you again. Remember when you exploded and started throwing things? Co-workers A: Ugh, let's not even go there. My parents gave me a good scolding for that.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader.\n2. Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n3. Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\n4. Co-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication.\n5. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n6. Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Haha, yeah, that was definitely a memorable moment. But hey, we all have our moments of weakness. It's all about learning and growing from them. And look at you now, taking on this new leadership role with grace and confidence. I have no doubt you'll handle it all like a pro.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several sentences that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it captures Co-worker A's aspiration to be a great leader, which aligns with their promotion to product manager and the related conversation in the context. However, the MEMORY lacks a natural flow or connectivity between the sentences, which could make it harder to extract a coherent narrative for generating responses. The MEMORY sentences are somewhat repetitive and fragmented, leading to a medium level of helpfulness. A score of 3 reflects that while certain sentences have the potential to benefit the response generation, the overall structure and phrasing could be improved for better clarity and context comprehension."
