Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become? Neighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out? Neighbors A: Yes, I go to the gym every day and lift weights. It's been really helping me build muscle. Neighbors B: That's great to hear! It reminds me of the time when you apologized to me for the way you treated me. Neighbors A: Yes, I realized that I needed to take responsibility for my actions and I didn't want to make the same mistake again. Neighbors B: It's always important to own up to our mistakes. It's like when you forgot your backpack in high school and had to deal with the consequences. Neighbors A: Definitely. It taught me to always be prepared and double-check everything. It's like how I make sure to tighten screws and wires when working on my computer. Neighbors B: It's all about being responsible and taking care of ourselves, just like how you take care of your physical health by working out. Neighbors A: Exactly! I believe that taking care of our physical and mental health is crucial for living a happy and fulfilling life.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B reminds Neighbors A about taking responsibility for their mistakes in the past and learning from them.\n2. Neighbors A apologized to Neighbors B for their behavior and admitted to being wrong.\n3. Neighbor A apologized to Neighbor B for their behavior and expressed a desire to make amends.\n4. Neighbor A values their friendship with Neighbor B and wants to ensure it remains strong.\n5. Neighbors A and B emphasize the importance of taking care of trees and the environment for future generations.\n6. Neighbors B offers help and support to Neighbors A in the situation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a great mindset to have, neighbor. I'm here to support you on your journey to a healthy and happy life. Let me know if you ever need any help or advice along the way.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly in capturing the theme of responsibility, past apologies, and the importance of their relationship. Sentences 1, 2, and 3 reflect the past interactions between Neighbors A and B related to accountability and making amends, which aligns with Neighbors B reminding Neighbors A about personal growth and the importance of being responsible. However, sentences 4, 5, and 6 introduce topics not directly relevant to the given context, such as environmental care and neighborly support, which are not mentioned in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Nonetheless, these extra pieces are naturally phrased, which maintains coherence, thereby not hindering the language model from identifying the more critical information. The overall development of MEMORY could benefit from tighter alignment with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT for a higher score."
