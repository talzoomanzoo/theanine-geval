Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today? Co-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there? Co-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done. Co-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded. Co-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out. Co-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends? Co-workers A: Ugh, don't remind me. That was such a disaster. Co-workers B: It was definitely not one of your finest moments. But it's good to see that you're being responsible now and taking care of things like sending packages.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides.\n2. Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides.\n3. Co-worker B is supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable.\n4. Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits.\n5. Co-worker A has been getting written up for being late to work.\n6. Co-worker A is trying to improve their punctuality and cut back on drinking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures the dynamics between Co-workers A and B, highlighting Co-worker B's awareness and concern about Co-worker A's past habits and their current efforts to improve. This provides a structured understanding of their interactions, which is directly related to the context discussed (such as responsibility and past incidents). The sentences are well-structured and naturally linked, illustrating the causality and connection between Co-worker A's past behavior and current efforts, which can aid a language model in generating an appropriate response. While not every detail is directly explored in the current context, the memories are phrased clearly, contributing to a coherent understanding of the situation."
