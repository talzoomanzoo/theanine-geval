Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I really enjoy being a carpenter. It's a very fulfilling job. Classmates B: That's great to hear! How did you get into carpentry? Classmates A: My dad was a carpenter, so I grew up around it. I started by helping him out when I was young, and then I began to really enjoy it myself. Classmates B: That's awesome that you were able to learn from your dad and turn it into a career. Have you done any big projects lately? Classmates A: Yeah, I just finished building a custom bookshelf for a client. It was a challenging project, but I'm really happy with how it turned out. Classmates B: That's impressive! You must have a lot of skill to be able to build something like that. Classmates A: Thanks! It definitely takes a lot of practice and attention to detail. But I find it really rewarding to see a finished product that I created with my own two hands.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate B is supportive and encourages Classmate A to pursue their dream.\n2. Classmates A appreciates the support and encouragement from Classmates B.\n3. Classmates A is attending a seminar on starting a business and is excited about applying that knowledge to future plans.\n4. Classmates B is supportive and encourages Classmates A in their business venture.\n5. Classmates A has had a business idea for a while and is now taking steps to make it a reality.\n6. Classmates A is willing to work hard and learn the necessary strategies for business success.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I can tell how passionate you are about carpentry. It's inspiring to see you turn your passion into a career. Keep up the great work!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains details about Classmate A's ambitions in starting a business and Classmate B's supportive nature, which are generally useful for understanding the dynamics between the two classmates. However, it does not provide direct information about their conversations related to carpentry or specific recent events that led to the dialogue context provided. The sentences about Classmate A's business seminar and future plans are well-structured and provide some context for past or similar interactions, but their relevance to carpentry is limited. Although the comments about support and encouragement are helpful in understanding the relationship, they don't fully align with the specific topics discussed in the dialogue. The MEMORY could have been more helpful if it contained specific information relevant to carpentry projects or experiences. Overall, MEMORY has a general relevance to DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it's not highly specific or directly connected to the immediate conversation about carpentry work."
