Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A has been getting written up for being late to work.\n2. Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits.\n3. Co-worker A has been successful in not being late to work for weeks.\n4. Co-worker A and their ex have both moved on from the breakup.\n5. Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions.\n6. Co-worker B is supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant aspects of past interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, specifically around Co-worker A's punctuality and efforts to improve. However, none of this information directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about visiting the post office. While the MEMORY shows development in terms of Co-worker A's personal responsibilities and Co-worker B's supportive role, it does not offer specific or direct cues related to the current dialog context about visiting the post office. The information provided could be useful in understanding the character traits and dynamics of the co-workers, but it falls short of linking directly to the given dialogue, limiting its helpfulness for generating an effective response."
