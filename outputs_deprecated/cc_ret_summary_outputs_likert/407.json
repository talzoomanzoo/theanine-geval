Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today? Co-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing. Co-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed. Co-workers B: That's really nice of you, but I don't want to burden you with my work. Co-workers A: It's not a burden if it's something I can do to support you. Plus, helping you out makes me feel good too. Co-workers B: You're right, thank you. You always go above and beyond to help me out. Co-workers A: That's what co-workers are for. We're a team and we need to support each other.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\n2. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health.\n3. Co-worker B is supportive and glad that Co-worker A is okay.\n4. Co-worker B is glad to have been able to help Co-worker A and feels the trade worked out well for both of them.\n5. Co-worker B agrees that their skill sets complement each other well.\n6. Co-worker A feels motivated about the future and is excited to work with Co-worker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided lacks direct relevance to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around Co-worker A offering help to Co-worker B and emphasizes teamwork and support. However, the MEMORY predominantly describes situations where Co-worker B is assisting or supporting Co-worker A, which is the reverse of the current scenario. \n\nThe sentences in the MEMORY also do not clearly connect with each other to form a coherent narrative that would help a language model generate a proper subsequent response. They mention general sentiments of support and teamwork, but they do not effectively represent the development or causality of events relevant to the current context where Co-worker A is the one offering support.\n\nTo be more helpful, the MEMORY should include past interactions that directly relate to Co-worker A's willingness and instances of offering help, rather than primarily focusing on Co-worker B's supportive actions."
