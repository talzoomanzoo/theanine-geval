Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn. Teacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation? Student: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle. Teacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time? Student: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then. Teacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going? Student: It's going pretty well. I started with French, but now I'm considering taking up Spanish and German too. I want to become more well-rounded. Teacher: That's a great goal. Have you thought about any specific ways you could use your language skills? Student: I would love to be able to travel more and speak with the locals in their native language. Maybe I could even teach my grandchildren some basic phrases. Teacher: Speaking of your grandchildren, how's your retirement planning going? Student: It's going well. I'm really looking forward to spending more time with them and taking them on fun trips. Teacher: That sounds like a great plan. Speaking of fun, remember when you scared me in the hallway a few days ago?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The student expresses excitement about retiring and spending time with their grandkids, already planning fun activities.\n2. The student is studying French at college and plans on learning Spanish and German as well.\n3. The teacher speaks Spanish and French fluently.\n4. The teacher encourages the student's retirement plans, highlighting the importance of focusing on family during retirement.\n5. The student has already made plans with their daughter and son-in-law to visit more often and take the grandkids on trips.\n6. The student felt rewarded by the experience and emphasized the importance of being aware of surroundings and acting quickly in emergencies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides a mix of relevant and somewhat helpful information, although not all sentences directly pertain to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 5 are closely tied to the conversation about retirement plans and spending time with grandchildren, reflecting the student's goals for retirement and connecting them to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 2 provides context on the student's language learning journey, aligning with the discussion about broadening language skills. Sentence 4 supports the conversation about focusing on family during retirement, which aids in understanding the dialogue more deeply. However, sentences 3 and 6 are less relevant to this specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 3, while not directly related to the current conversation, provides context about the teacher's language skills, which may enrich future interactions but isn't immediately useful for this discussion. Sentence 6 does not relate to any part of the provided interaction, making it less helpful. Overall, the MEMORY offers useful context while capturing the ongoing dialogue's theme, but some parts are less connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n"
