    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now! Neighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen? Neighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest. Neighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations! What are you going to do with all that money? Neighbors A: Well, first I'm going to pay off my mortgage and all my debts. After that, I think I'll take a nice long vacation and maybe donate some to charity. Neighbors B: That's very generous of you. Have you thought about investing any of it? Neighbors A: Yes, actually. I've been doing some research and I think I want to invest in some stocks and maybe even start my own business. Neighbors B: That sounds like a great idea. You have the opportunity to do so much with your newfound wealth. Neighbors A: Definitely. It's funny how things can change so quickly. Just a few years ago, I was stuck in a job I hated and now I have all this freedom. Neighbors B: Speaking of jobs, have you thought about what you want to do now? You don't really have to work if you don't want to. Neighbors A: I know, but I don't think I could ever completely give up working. Plus, I have some ideas for businesses that I want to pursue. I think this money will give me the push I need to start something new. Neighbors B: I'm excited to see what you come up with. You're definitely one of the most driven people I know.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A made a big career change recently and is much happier now.\n2. Neighbors A is feeling stagnant in their current job and is looking for more growth and challenge.\n3. Neighbors A took the leap to make a change and is glad they did.\n4. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's decision and admires the courage it took.\n5. Neighbors B has been supportive of Neighbors A's job search, offering to connect them with people in different industries.\n6. Neighbors A and B had a conversation a couple of years ago about needing a change.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks for always believing in me and supporting me, it means a lot. I'm grateful for this opportunity and I can't wait to see where this new chapter takes me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains some details about the past interactions between Neighbors A and B, such as A making a career change, feeling stagnant in their job, and Neighbors B being supportive. While these points are relevant to the current dialogue context of career change and exploring new opportunities, the memory is not very structured or detailed. Most of the sentences in the memory provide a very general overview of past interactions and do not offer specific information or contextual cues that could significantly aid in generating the next response in the dialogue. Additionally, some details like the memory of past job search support do not naturally connect with the current context of becoming a millionaire and having the means to start new ventures without constraint. Overall, the MEMORY is somewhat useful but limited in its capacity to provide substantial context for Unknown to generate a more informed and contextually rich response."
