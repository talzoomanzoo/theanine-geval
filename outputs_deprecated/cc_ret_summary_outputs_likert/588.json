    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I really enjoy being a carpenter. It's a very fulfilling job. Classmates B: That's great to hear! How did you get into carpentry? Classmates A: My dad was a carpenter, so I grew up around it. I started by helping him out when I was young, and then I began to really enjoy it myself. Classmates B: That's awesome that you were able to learn from your dad and turn it into a career. Have you done any big projects lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate B is supportive and encourages Classmate A to pursue their dream.\n2. Classmates A is attending a seminar on starting a business and is excited about applying that knowledge to future plans.\n3. Classmates A appreciates the support and encouragement from Classmates B.\n4. Classmate B offers to support and potentially collaborate with Classmate A in the future.\n5. Classmates B is supportive and encourages Classmates A in their business venture.\n6. Classmates A has had a business idea for a while and is now taking steps to make it a reality.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, I recently finished a custom-built bookshelf for a client. It was challenging, but I loved every minute of it. Thank you for always being so supportive of my carpentry work.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some supportive and encouraging interactions between Classmates A and B, which aligns well with the positive and supportive nature of the dialogue context. Memory points 1, 3, and 5 highlight the supportive nature of Classmate B, which is consistent with the ongoing conversation's tone, where Classmate B appreciates Classmate A's career and upbringing. However, parts of the MEMORY focus on aspects not directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Classmate A attending a seminar on starting a business (point 2) and taking steps toward a business idea (point 6). These do not precisely connect to the current conversation about carpentry and recent projects. The MEMORY lacks clear development and causality related to the specific context of the conversation about carpentry, making it moderately helpful but not fully aligned with this specific instance. The evidence of support and potential collaboration mentioned in point 4 could be potentially useful, as it suggests a future connection, but again, itâ€™s not directly tied to the carpenter context. The natural phrasing of the MEMORY makes it easy for the language model to identify the supportive relationship but does not offer much direct relevance to carpentry projects or details."
