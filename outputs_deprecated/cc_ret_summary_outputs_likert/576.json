Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B appreciates Neighbors A's handy skills.\n2. Neighbor A noticed some wood near their backyard and asked Neighbor B if they had seen it too.\n3. Neighbor A values their friendship with Neighbor B and wants to ensure it remains strong.\n4. Neighbors B offers help and support to Neighbors A in the situation.\n5. Neighbors A values double-checking before leaving the house.\n6. Neighbors A and B discuss the possibility of someone in the neighborhood using the wood for a project.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains a mix of helpful and less-relevant information in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 3, and 4 provide context about the relationship and interactions between Neighbors A and B, indicating appreciation, support, and the value placed on their friendship. This is helpful information as it sets a positive tone and indicates trust and collaboration, which could be relevant given Neighbor A's question about noticing a change in physical strength. Sentences 2 and 6 are moderately connected, suggesting a shared interest in the neighborhood and potential activities that might have previously involved physical strength. Sentence 5, however, is less directly relevant to the current dialogue context about Neighbor A's physical state. Overall, while not all sentences are directly relevant, the structure and content give a reasonable amount of useful background for generating a response."
