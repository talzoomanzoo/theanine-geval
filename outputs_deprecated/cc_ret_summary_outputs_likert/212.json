Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn. Teacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation? Student: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle. Teacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time? Student: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then. Teacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going? Student: It's going pretty well. I started with French, but now I'm considering taking up Spanish and German too. I want to become more well-rounded. Teacher: That's a great goal. Have you thought about any specific ways you could use your language skills? Student: I would love to be able to travel more and speak with the locals in their native language. Maybe I could even teach my grandchildren some basic phrases. Teacher: Speaking of your grandchildren, how's your retirement planning going? Student: It's going well. I'm really looking forward to spending more time with them and taking them on fun trips. Teacher: That sounds like a great plan. Speaking of fun, remember when you scared me in the hallway a few days ago? Student: Oh, I'm so sorry about that. I was having a bad day and I shouldn't have taken it out on you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The teacher speaks Spanish and French fluently.\n2. The student expresses excitement about retiring and spending time with their grandkids, already planning fun activities.\n3. The student is studying French at college and plans on learning Spanish and German as well.\n4. The student apologizes to the teacher for yelling in the hallway, acknowledging it was out of character and seeking to move past it.\n5. The student mentioned feeling stressed lately, which may have led to the outburst.\n6. The teacher and student have a positive and understanding relationship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides information that is highly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, offering insights into the interactions and relationship between the student and teacher. It contains specific points mentioned in the dialogue such as the student's language learning journey (covering studying French and plans for Spanish and German), retirement plans, and the incident in the hallway, including the student's apology and behavior. The additional detail about the teacher's fluency in Spanish and French can provide further context for potential future conversations involving language study. Furthermore, the MEMORY comprehensively captures the positive and understanding nature of the relationship between the teacher and student, reinforcing the interactions presented in the dialogue. The structured and interconnected information makes it easy for a language model to identify and leverage these contextual cues, indicating the MEMORY is well-suited to support producing an appropriate response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
