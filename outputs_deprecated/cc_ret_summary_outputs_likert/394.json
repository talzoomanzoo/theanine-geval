    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing! Neighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go? Neighbors A: I visited Brazil and Peru. The culture and food were incredible. Neighbors B: That sounds awesome. I've always wanted to go to Peru to see Machu Picchu.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and B both took a cooking class together last year.\n2. Neighbors A and B believe in doing nice things for others to bring the community together.\n3. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's organization skills and wishes to improve their own organization.\n4. Both Neighbors A and B believe in the importance of learning and self-improvement.\n5. Neighbors B remembers the incident.\n6. Neighbor A is feeling frustrated and is considering going to a bar to find someone for a casual encounter.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains sentences that are not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Neighbors A's trip to South America and the discussion about Brazil and Peru. The MEMORY mentions past interactions and characteristics between the neighbors that are mildly helpful in understanding their relationship, such as their shared cooking class and mutual beliefs in learning and self-improvement. However, these details do not aid in generating a response that pertains to the current conversation about travel experiences. The statement about Neighbors B's memory of an incident is vague and unexplained, and the sentence about Neighbor A's frustration and potential casual encounter seems out of context and potentially irrelevant. Overall, while some aspects of the MEMORY reveal aspects of their relationship, it largely lacks direct connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it minimally helpful."
