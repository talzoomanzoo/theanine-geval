Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager!

Co-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products. Co-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader? Co-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago. Co-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader.\n2.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides a helpful background for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly in understanding the progression of Co-worker A's career aspirations and development. The MEMORY includes statements about Co-worker A's long-standing ambitions (sentences 3, 4, 6) and Co-worker A's consideration of taking on more responsibilities as they pursue a leadership role (sentence 2). These statements are relevant because they establish a prior context for Co-worker A's recent promotion to a product manager roles, showing the evolution of their career goals and personal growth (sentence 5). Sentence 1 supports the context, indicating past encouragement from Co-worker B, which sets a precedent for the continued support seen in the dialogue. While the connections and relevance demonstrated are strong, the MEMORY's structure could be slightly more cohesive to merit a full score of 5. Nonetheless, the information provided is pertinent and aligned with the current conversation, helping in the generation of an appropriate response."
