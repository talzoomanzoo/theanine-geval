Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly. Neighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit? Neighbors A: It was Chicago. I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations. Neighbors B: I bet it was a nice change of scenery from our neighborhood. Neighbors A: Definitely. But you know, it's interesting how much our neighborhood has grown on me over the years. I remember when I first moved here, I was so unsure about it. Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember. But you stayed because you wanted to be here. Neighbors A: That's right. And since then, I've made so many great memories here. It's become my home. Neighbors B: And you're still spending time with God every day, right? Neighbors A: Yes, I am. It brings me so much peace and happiness. Neighbors B: That's really admirable. And speaking of power, I remember you telling me about that time when you could make me do anything you wanted.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A enjoys living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbor A has been living in the same place for a long time and enjoys the neighborhood and people there.\n3. Neighbors A finds spending time with God brings them peace and happiness.\n4. Neighbors B has been living in the neighborhood for some time and is supportive of Neighbors A.\n5. Neighbors A is excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends.\n6. Neighbors A believes this routine has brought positive changes, helping them stay focused, calm, and grateful.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically regarding Neighbors A's feelings about their neighborhood and their routine of spending time with God. However, the connections between individual memories are not fully developed, and there isn't a clear portrayal of past interactions between the speakers. Information such as the support from Neighbor B or Neighbors A's excitement to explore the neighborhood could be better integrated or more directly linked to the specific details of the context. While MEMORY does provide some help, it doesn't fully encapsulate the causality and development of the conversation, making it moderately helpful but not optimally structured or comprehensive."
