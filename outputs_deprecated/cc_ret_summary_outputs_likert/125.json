Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now! Neighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen? Neighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest. Neighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations! What are you going to do with all that money? Neighbors A: Well, first I'm going to pay off my mortgage and all my debts. After that, I think I'll take a nice long vacation and maybe donate some to charity. Neighbors B: That's very generous of you. Have you thought about investing any of it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's decision and admires the courage it took.\n2. Neighbors A made a big career change recently and is much happier now.\n3. Neighbors A appreciates Neighbors B's understanding and willingness to listen and talk about the experience.\n4. Neighbors B has been supportive of Neighbors A's job search, offering to connect them with people in different industries.\n5. Neighbors A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship.\n6. Neighbors A and B had a conversation a couple of years ago about needing a change.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I have thought about investing some of it, but I want to be smart about it and make sure I do my research first. It's a big responsibility to manage this kind of money.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a useful backdrop for understanding the relationship between Neighbors A and B, which helps in generating a coherent and contextually appropriate response. Key points from the MEMORY, such as the supportive relationship between the neighbors (sentences 1, 3, and 5), add depth to the ongoing conversation about Neighbors A's newfound wealth and financial plans. These elements emphasize Neighbors B's supportive nature, which aligns with their responses in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, sentence 2 about a career change and sentence 4 about a job search do not directly relate to the current conversation's focus on inheritance and finances, although they still contribute to the overall understanding of the neighbors' relationship. Therefore, the MEMORY scores well in providing helpful information, but it could be more directly aligned with the ongoing context."
