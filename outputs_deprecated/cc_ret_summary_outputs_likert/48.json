    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today. Classmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate B is interested in attending a new technology conference next month.\n2. Classmates B noticed Classmates A's improvement and acknowledged their hard work.\n3. Classmates A's grades are looking good according to their teacher.\n4. Classmates B recalls a funny moment from high school involving Classmates A wearing pajamas to school.\n5. Classmates B is supportive of Classmates A's new relationship and believes they found someone who makes them happy.\n6. Classmate B is working on finishing a history project.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains various pieces of information about the two classmates, A and B. However, most of these sentences are not directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is centered around an interesting talk attended by Classmate A. The most potentially relevant memory would be if Classmate B had expressed interest in talks or events, as seen in sentence 1, which mentions a technology conference, but it does not directly relate to the talk attended by Classmate A. The other sentences in MEMORY focus on high school memories, academic progress, personal life, and projects, none of which tie into the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the sentences are generally well-structured and provide some context about past interactions, they don't offer substantial help or connection to generate a response specific to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the talk."
