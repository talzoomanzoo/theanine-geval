Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel really fulfilled as a leader and guide. Helping others gives me a sense of purpose.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B values finding fulfillment in work, pursuing hobbies, making a difference in the world, and building relationships with others.\n2. Co-worker A believes that making money can lead to fulfillment and provide the freedom to pursue hobbies and interests.\n3. Co-worker A had a positive experience with a commander who helped them feel safe.\n4. Co-worker B emphasizes the importance of acknowledging privileges and using them to make the world a better place.\n5. Co-worker A believes that everyone has the ability to create opportunities and make their own luck through hard work and seizing opportunities.\n6. Co-worker A values making money and is interested in opportunities to do so.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! It's so important to use our privileges and talents to make a positive impact in the world. I'm glad you find fulfillment in helping others.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains a mix of relevant and irrelevant information with respect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 1 is somewhat relevant as it states Co-worker B also values fulfillment in work, which aligns with Co-worker A's statement about feeling fulfilled as a leader and guide. Furthermore, sentence 4, which discusses using privileges to make the world better, could be tangentially related to the concept of helping others. However, sentences 2, 3, 5, and 6 focus on Co-worker A's beliefs about money, creating opportunities, and past experiences, which are not directly related to the sense of fulfillment expressed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences are structured clearly, which aids in understanding the speakers' past interactions, but the direct relevance to the current dialogue is weak. Thus, the MEMORY provides moderate helpfulness for generating the next response."
