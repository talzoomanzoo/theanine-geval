Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me. Co-workers B: That's amazing to hear. Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job. Co-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work. Co-workers B: It's great to have that kind of positive reinforcement. Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated? Co-workers A: Oh yeah, I remember. I was so angry after blowing up that rabbit with the dynamite. But talking it out with you really helped me work through my emotions. Co-workers B: That's right. It's important to have someone to talk to when you're feeling overwhelmed or upset. Co-workers A: And speaking of talking it out, do you remember when I was a kid and I ran to our parents screaming because of that spider?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.\n2. Co-worker A felt remorse for what they did and appreciated Co-worker B's understanding.\n3. Co-worker B acknowledges that some people have fears and suggests finding healthy ways to deal with frustrations.\n4. Co-worker A and Co-worker B met on a movie set and are now good friends.\n5. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to try relaxation techniques or find a hobby to de-stress and overcome fears.\n6. Co-worker B emphasized the importance of learning from mistakes and working together as a team.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I remember that! It's normal to have fears, especially as a child. We all have things that scare us. It's important to find healthy ways to deal with those fears, like relaxation techniques or finding a hobby to focus on. And hey, look at us now - working together and overcoming challenges as a team.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided offers helpful information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures the supportive relationship between Co-workers A and B, mentioning their collaboration and how they bring out the best in each other during work â€” a context reflected in the dialogue. Additionally, it highlights Co-worker A's feelings of remorse and appreciation, reminiscent of the acknowledgment and support discussed in the dialogue. The MEMORY entries about overcoming fears and finding healthy coping mechanisms also resonate with Co-worker B's supportive and encouraging nature mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Despite a few elements being slightly detached from specific dialogue events, the MEMORY generally frames the past interactions between the two, allowing the language model to generate a coherent response. Hence, it effectively offers a base for extending or interpreting dialogue interactions and earns a rating of 4."
