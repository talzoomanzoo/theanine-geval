Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I know you know something about my past. Can you tell me what it is? Classmates B: I'm sorry,, but I can't disclose that information. It's not my place to tell.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B warns Classmates A about the potential danger of dark alleys.\n2. Classmates A is curious and open to exploring new things and taking risks.\n3. Classmates B advises Classmates A to be careful and aware while on the bus.\n4. Classmates A and B became friends when Classmates A transferred to the school.\n5. Classmates B appreciates the genuine friendship and positive attitude of Classmates A.\n6. Classmates A doesn't have their own car yet and takes the bus.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that could help generate a response for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes a relationship between Classmates A and B, which is important given the conversation is based on past interactions and possibly a sensitive topic. The MEMORY highlights that they became friends after Classmates A transferred to the school, indicating familiarity and trust, which can be useful contextual information.\n\nHowever, most of the sentences in the MEMORY don't directly connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on Classmates A wanting to learn something about their past that Classmates B knows. The MEMORY details more general advice and characteristics rather than any specific sensitive information or interactions that would be directly relevant to the context provided.\n\nTherefore, while the MEMORY contains useful relationship-building context, it lacks specific connections to the dialogue's topic of secretive or sensitive information from the past. The phrasing is clear, but the particular detail the context is centered around is not addressed."
