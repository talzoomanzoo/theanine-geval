Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: It's great to have friends who can help each other out, isn't it? Neighbors B: Absolutely. It's a two-way street, and it's important to be there for each other. Neighbors A: I remember when I helped you move last year, and then you watched my cat when I went on vacation. Neighbors B: Yes, and I appreciate it so much. It's always nice to have someone you can count on.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the suggestion.\n2. Neighbors B offered to help Neighbors A with the apology process.\n3. Both neighbors express the difficulty of not being able to adopt all the animals they see but appreciate those who do adopt and give them loving homes.\n4. Neighbors A bought a necklace from Neighbors B's shop and loves it.\n5. Neighbors B emphasized the importance of apologizing to show care for the relationship.\n6. Neighbors A was looking for a new necklace and stumbled upon Neighbors B's shop.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I totally agree. It's comforting to know that we have each other's backs. Like when you helped me pick out the perfect necklace from your shop, it means a lot to me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains sentences that are somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, the MEMORY mentions appreciation and mutual relationships (Sentences 1 and 5), which are themes present in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about helping each other out. However, other sentences in the MEMORY (Sentences 2, 3, 4, and 6) introduce new topics or events (e.g., buying a necklace, discussing animal adoption) that do not directly relate to or develop the conversation about mutual help and support in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Although these sentences are naturally structured, they do not provide much help in generating the next response pertaining to the specific topic at hand. Overall, the MEMORY contains a mixture of relevant and less relevant sentences with respect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
