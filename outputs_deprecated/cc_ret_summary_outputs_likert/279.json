Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nAthlete: Ted Athlete unrolls the map. He looks at it for a few moments before tracing his finger along one of the highways. \"This is our route,\" he says finally, feeling in control. Coach: What route are you planning, Ted? Athlete: I'm thinking of taking the highway through the mountains, it's a bit longer, but the scenery is beautiful. Coach: That sounds like a good plan, as long as we factor in enough time for rest stops and breaks. Athlete: Yes, I was thinking we could stop at a few rest areas along the way. It's important to stay hydrated and keep our energy levels up during long drives. Coach: Definitely. Speaking of energy levels, how's your nutrition plan been going? Have you been keeping up with eating healthy foods like those bean sprouts we talked about? Athlete: Yes, Coach. I've been incorporating more nutrient-dense foods like bean sprouts into my diet. And I've noticed a significant improvement in my overall energy levels and performance on the field. Coach: That's great to hear. Your dedication to your health and performance is really paying off, Ted. I can't wait to see what you'll accomplish next. Athlete: Thanks, Coach. I feel like I've really found my stride and I'm excited for what the future holds.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The coach encourages the athlete to continue their good work with nutrition and training.\n2. The Coach is giving advice to the Athlete regarding their performance and focus.\n3. The Coach has noticed the Athlete's improvement and dedication to improving skills.\n4. The Athlete is focused on helping the team succeed and has shown leadership qualities during warm-ups and stretches.\n5. The Coach encourages the Athlete to keep up the good work and acknowledges their achievements.\n6. The Athlete is focused on improving their performance and energy levels.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides a general overview of the athlete's dedication, improvement, and focus on nutrition and performance, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where the athlete discusses the route, hydration, and diet improvements. However, the MEMORY consists primarily of generic statements without specific details or connections that would assist a language model in generating a more contextually nuanced response. While it captures the overall theme of encouragement and improvement present in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it lacks the specific situational details (e.g., plan for traveling through mountains, nutrition related to bean sprouts) that would have improved its helpfulness rating."
