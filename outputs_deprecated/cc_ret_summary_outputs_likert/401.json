Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A has been feeling off lately.\n2. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\n3. Co-worker B is supportive and glad that Co-worker A is okay.\n4. Co-worker A now has a good job and is doing well, despite their difficult upbringing.\n5. Co-worker A values their health to continue working at their best.\n6. Co-worker A feels motivated about the future and is excited to work with Co-worker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for the language model in generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It offers insights into the relationship and interactions between Co-workers A and B, highlighting important aspects such as Co-worker B's supportive nature and Co-worker A's current positive outlook and motivation. Sentences such as Co-worker B offering help and support and Co-worker A feeling motivated about the future are especially relevant, given the context of discussing workload, as they can inform a response that acknowledges ongoing support and motivation. While some information, like Co-worker A's upbringing, might not be directly necessary for the immediate context, the overall helpfulness and connectedness of the MEMORY support a high score. The sentences are mostly well-structured, providing a clear sense of the past interactions without detracting from the usefulness related to the context."
