Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me. Co-workers B: That's amazing to hear. Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job. Co-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work. Co-workers B: It's great to have that kind of positive reinforcement. Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated? Co-workers A: Oh yeah, I remember. I was so angry after blowing up that rabbit with the dynamite. But talking it out with you really helped me work through my emotions. Co-workers B: That's right. It's important to have someone to talk to when you're feeling overwhelmed or upset.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.\n2. Co-worker A felt remorse for what they did and appreciated Co-worker B's understanding.\n3. Co-worker A and Co-worker B met on a movie set and are now good friends.\n4. Co-worker B acknowledges that some people have fears and suggests finding healthy ways to deal with frustrations.\n5. Co-worker B emphasized the importance of learning from mistakes and working together as a team.\n6. Co-worker A had a tough week on set, feeling overwhelmed and chaotic.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information that reflects on the two co-workers' past interactions, which can assist a language model in generating an appropriate response for the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 2, and 3 provide insight into the positive outcomes of their collaboration and their friendship, aligning with the ongoing discussion about support and communication at work. Sentences 4 and 5 relate to Co-worker B's attitude towards overcoming challenges and learning from experiences, which could guide further conversation about handling frustrations, as seen in the discussion about the frustration with the movie set. Sentence 6 adds context about Co-worker A's feelings of being overwhelmed, echoing the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORYâ€™s sentences are connected and relevant, providing a coherent backstory to the dialogue while also offering cues that could lead the conversation forward."
