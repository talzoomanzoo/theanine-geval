Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn. Teacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation? Student: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The teacher and student have a positive and understanding relationship.\n2. The student mentioned feeling stressed lately, which may have led to the outburst.\n3. The student felt rewarded by the experience and emphasized the importance of being aware of surroundings and acting quickly in emergencies.\n4. The student once saved a kid from drowning and had a moment of yelling at the teacher in the past.\n5. The teacher expressed understanding and encouraged the student to seek help when needed.\n6. The student apologizes to the teacher for yelling in the hallway, acknowledging it was out of character and seeking to move past it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I can understand that. It's all about finding the right balance for your taste buds. Just like in life, finding that balance can sometimes be challenging but rewarding in the end.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some sentences that imply a background context of the relationship between the teacher and the student, such as their positive and understanding bond and a past incident involving the student yelling at the teacher. However, these memories do not directly contribute much to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the hot sauce experience. The memories focus more on broader aspects of their relationship and an unrelated past event (the student saving a kid from drowning). There is no direct relevance or natural connection between the MEMORY and the specific topic being discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is the student's love-hate relationship with hot sauce. While the MEMORY provides a bit of insight into the personalities and past interactions, it does not provide substantial contextual cues or development directly pertinent to generating a relevant next response to the current dialogue."
