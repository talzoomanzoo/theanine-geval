    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work. Wife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Wife suggests that husband should try using more modern language to be better understood.\n2. Both the husband and wife express a desire for happiness and understanding in the situation.\n3. Wife brings up Sarah, the husband's previous partner, but husband says he hasn't thought about her much.\n4. The husband is open to learning more about movies, showing a willingness to try again.\n5. The wife is knowledgeable about movies and is willing to share her passion with the husband.\n6. Husband agrees to try adapting to modern language for better communication with his wife.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some sentences that are marginally relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, like adapting language for better communication, and a shared desire for happiness and understanding. However, these do not directly address the husband's current issue of being stuck with his writing. There is little in MEMORY about the husband's writing process or creative problem-solving, which would have been more helpful. While the MEMORY is not entirely irrelevant, it does not provide strong contextual cues that could guide the generation of a response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Furthermore, the mention of Sarah and movies seem disconnected from the current dialogue, adding less value to the conversation at hand. Overall, while the MEMORY includes some general themes of communication and willingness to explore options, it lacks specific relevance to the issue raised in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
