Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today. Wife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that. Husband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you. Wife: You always go above and beyond, dear. Husband: It's the little things that count, right? Wife: Definitely. Speaking of little things, do you remember when you told me about catching the bus just in time a few months ago? Husband: Oh yes, I remember. I was so relieved I didn't have to wait in the cold for the next one. Wife: It's amazing how small moments like that can make such a big difference in our day, isn't it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband appreciates the little things in life, such as making it to the bus on time.\n2. Both the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful.\n3. The husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that make him happy outside of work and family life.\n4. The wife is glad to see the husband finding a sense of purpose and being happy.\n5. The wife mentions that the husband had to run to catch the bus a couple of years ago.\n6. The husband enjoys being outside and loves the weather after being stuck indoors at work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful background information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 2 are directly relevant as they reflect the theme of appreciating the \"little things,\" which is a significant part of the conversation between the husband and wife. Sentence 5 slightly mismatches the time frame of the memory with the dialogue context, yet is still relevant because it highlights an event they both remember and discuss. Sentence 3 and 4, while not directly related to the specific context of this dialogue, connect well with the overall themes of support and happiness in their relationship, which could be beneficial for a language model in understanding the dynamics between the speakers. However, Sentence 6 about the husband enjoying being outside does not significantly contribute to the specific dialogue context and thus is less helpful overall. The MEMORY is mostly relevant and contains naturally connected sentences that demonstrate the relationship between the husband and wife, aiding the generation of a contextually appropriate next response."
