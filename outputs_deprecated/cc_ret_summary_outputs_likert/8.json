Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life. Child: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you. Parent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you. Child: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you? Parent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference. Child: I'm glad you found someone to talk to. You know, I remember when we watched the sunrise together a few weeks ago. That was really special. Parent: It was. I love being able to appreciate the beauty of nature. And you know, having my own place to live in the suburbs makes it even easier to do things like that. Child: Yeah, your house is really nice. You've always been good at taking care of yourself. Parent: Well, I've always valued my independence. Even as a kid, I wanted to do things on my own. That's why I decided to live on my own a few years ago.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The parent values independence and self-sufficiency.\n3. The child is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes.\n4. The parent now lives in a little house in the suburbs that they love.\n5. The child is supportive and caring towards the parent.\n6. The child recalls a memorable morning watching the sunrise with the parent.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Most sentences in the MEMORY reflect the themes and interactions present in the context. The Parent's appreciation for small moments and values such as independence mentioned in the MEMORY align well with the Parent's expression of valuing listening skills and self-sufficiency discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The child's supportiveness and recall of a memorable sunrise, as mentioned in the MEMORY, also relate directly to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where the Child shows understanding and connection with the Parent. The MEMORY captures the development of both characters and their interactions.\n\nWhile the MEMORY predominantly aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, some sentences are slightly redundant or do not add significant new information (e.g., \"The child is supportive and proud\" and \"The child is supportive and caring\" are similar). However, they are naturally phrased and do not hinder understanding. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured and beneficial for contextually grounded response generation."
