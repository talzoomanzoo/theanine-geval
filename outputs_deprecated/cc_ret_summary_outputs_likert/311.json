    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway? Wife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go? Husband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city. Wife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband has long-awaited plans and is finally taking action on them.\n2. The husband got impatient and excited about his plans, leading him to leave without the wife.\n3. The wife supports the husband's goals but wanted to be involved in them.\n4. The wife offers her support and encouragement to the husband in his journey towards achieving his dreams.\n5. The husband is inspired by his wife to take action on his dreams and goals.\n6. The husband apologized and promised to involve the wife in his plans in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful context for understanding the interaction between the husband and wife. Sentences like 1, 3, 5, and 6 help establish the husband's long-awaited plans and his desire to involve the wife, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about planning a weekend getaway. However, sentences 2 and 4 are less useful in this context, as they do not directly relate to the scenario described. Moreover, there is a lack of clear development or causality in the MEMORY related to the specific plan of a weekend getaway. Overall, the MEMORY contains some relevant details but does not fully connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT in a seamless manner."
