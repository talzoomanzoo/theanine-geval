Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me. Co-workers B: That's amazing to hear. Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A is grateful for life experiences and is open to new possibilities in the future.\n2. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.\n3. Co-worker A felt remorse for what they did and appreciated Co-worker B's understanding.\n4. Co-worker A has grown as a person and as an artist, learning about empathy and compassion.\n5. Co-worker B emphasized the importance of learning from mistakes and working together as a team.\n6. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to try relaxation techniques or find a hobby to de-stress and overcome fears.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I completely agree. Their support has really helped me grow and push myself to new heights.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains several sentences that reflect the past interactions and general relationship between Co-worker A and Co-worker B. However, the memory's helpfulness to generate a response to the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT is limited. While both Co-worker A and B's past interactions are mentioned, most of the points are not directly relevant to the supportive boss mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY provides some insights into Co-worker A and B's relationship and attitudes, such as their appreciation for collaboration and growth, but it lacks a strong connection to the current topic of conversation, which focuses on the supportive nature of A's boss. Furthermore, the sentences in the MEMORY are not clearly connected or causally structured to provide a coherent context for the current dialogue. Thus, while there is some helpful background information, it is not directly applicable to the given context."
