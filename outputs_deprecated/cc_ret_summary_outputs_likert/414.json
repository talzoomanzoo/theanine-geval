Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately. Classmates B: Why is that? Classmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A is always looking to challenge themselves and improve their skills.\n2. Classmates A is struggling with feeling competitive and the need to be the best at everything.\n3. Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness.\n4. Classmates B is supportive and emphasizes the importance of having someone to talk to about personal matters.\n5. Classmate A and Classmate B are classmates.\n6. Classmates A faced tough competition in middle school from a fast girl, motivating them to improve.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! I admire your determination to challenge yourself and improve your skills. Remember, it's not about being the best at everything, but about personal growth and progress. If you ever need someone to talk to about your struggles or achievements, I'm here for you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains a mix of relevant and less relevant information for generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 1 is helpful as it aligns with Classmate A's desire to improve, which connects with their focus on studying algebra. Sentence 2 and Sentence 6 provide background on the competitive drive of Classmate A, which indirectly relates to their motivation for studying algebra. Sentence 3 shows Classmate B's acknowledgment of Classmate A's traits, which might influence their response. Sentence 4 introduces the dynamic of support, which could be relevant in a broader context but not directly in this dialogue snippet. Sentence 5 provides basic context about their relationship but does not enhance the understanding of the dialogue. Overall, while some sentences provide context or characterization that can inform a future response, the connections are not deeply developed, leaving some potential for a more nuanced response."
