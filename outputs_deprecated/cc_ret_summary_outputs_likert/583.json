Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become? Neighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out? Neighbors A: Yes, I go to the gym every day and lift weights. It's been really helping me build muscle. Neighbors B: That's great to hear! It reminds me of the time when you apologized to me for the way you treated me. Neighbors A: Yes, I realized that I needed to take responsibility for my actions and I didn't want to make the same mistake again. Neighbors B: It's always important to own up to our mistakes. It's like when you forgot your backpack in high school and had to deal with the consequences. Neighbors A: Definitely. It taught me to always be prepared and double-check everything. It's like how I make sure to tighten screws and wires when working on my computer. Neighbors B: It's all about being responsible and taking care of ourselves, just like how you take care of your physical health by working out.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B reminds Neighbors A about taking responsibility for their mistakes in the past and learning from them.\n2. Neighbors A apologized to Neighbors B for their behavior and admitted to being wrong.\n3. Neighbor A apologized to Neighbor B for their behavior and expressed a desire to make amends.\n4. Neighbors B appreciates Neighbors A's handy skills.\n5. Neighbors B offers help and support to Neighbors A in the situation.\n6. Neighbor A values their friendship with Neighbor B and wants to ensure it remains strong.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains sentences that reflect Neighbors A's recognition of past mistakes and Neighbors B's appreciation of Neighbors A's qualities and support, which are relevant themes in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, items 1, 2, and 3 in MEMORY align with the themes of responsibility and amends discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, items 4, 5, and 6 add information about Neighbors A's skills, Neighbors B's support, and their strong friendship, which are not directly referenced in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but are still useful for building a broader understanding of the characters' relationship. Overall, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful as it provides relevant context for generating a response, though parts are not directly applicable to the specific conversation. The structure is clear, but some connections could be enhanced to provide a clearer causality or development link to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
