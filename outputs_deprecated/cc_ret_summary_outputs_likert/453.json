Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I know you know something about my past. Can you tell me what it is? Classmates B: I'm sorry,, but I can't disclose that information. It's not my place to tell. Classmates A: But how did you find out? I haven't told anyone. Classmates B: Let's just say I have my ways of finding out things. But don't worry,, it's nothing bad or embarrassing. Classmates A: Okay, but it's still bothering me that you know something about me that even my closest friends don't know. Classmates B: I understand how you feel, but sometimes it's best to keep certain things to ourselves. Trust me, it's for your own good.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B warns Classmates A about the potential danger of dark alleys.\n2. Classmates B advises Classmates A to be careful and aware while on the bus.\n3. Classmates A is curious and open to exploring new things and taking risks.\n4. Classmates A was nervous about fitting in but saw Classmates B as well-liked and wanted to be friends with them.\n5. Classmates B appreciates the genuine friendship and positive attitude of Classmates A.\n6. Classmates B is open to trying to be more optimistic after the conversation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains information about the past interactions between Classmates A and B. However, most of the sentences do not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The dialogue revolves around Classmates B knowing something about Classmates A's past, which is causing concern for Classmates A. The MEMORY focuses on general interactions, warnings, and character traits of Classmates A and B rather than the specific issue at hand. While there is some context about their relationship from past interactions that might influence how Classmates B gains knowledge about Classmates A or why Classmates A is bothered, it lacks any information directly related to the secretive knowledge Classmates B has about Classmates A. Furthermore, sentences in MEMORY are loosely connected, missing clear relevance or causality to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, this MEMORY provides little helpful information for generating a specific response based on the context of the dialogue."
