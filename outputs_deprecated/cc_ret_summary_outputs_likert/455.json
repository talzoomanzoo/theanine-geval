Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there.\n2. Neighbor A appreciates the emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during their time of grief.\n3. Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.\n4. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have a close friendship and have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n5. Neighbor A's old apartment building was not the best place to live in.\n6. Neighbor A finds solace in nature and believes that it helps in coping with their emotions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information regarding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly in terms of the emotional support Neighbor B offers (point 2) and the close friendship they share (point 4). This can aid in generating an empathetic response from Neighbor B, given Neighbor A's current distress. However, other points like moving to a safer neighborhood (point 1), the quality of the old apartment (point 5), and finding solace in nature (point 6) are not directly relevant to the context of being left by a partner. Additionally, while the mention of the grandmother's passing (point 3) offers some insight into previous grief Neighbor A has experienced, it might not be immediately connected to their feelings about the breakup. Overall, while there is some relevant information, not all parts of the MEMORY are connected or directly conducive to forming the next response in this context."
