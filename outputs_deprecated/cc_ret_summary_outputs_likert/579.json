    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become? Neighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out? Neighbors A: Yes, I go to the gym every day and lift weights. It's been really helping me build muscle. Neighbors B: That's great to hear! It reminds me of the time when you apologized to me for the way you treated me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A apologized to Neighbors B for their behavior and admitted to being wrong.\n2. Neighbor A apologized to Neighbor B for their behavior and expressed a desire to make amends.\n3. Neighbor B accepted Neighbor A's apology and mentioned that it was hurtful to be treated that way.\n4. Neighbors B offers help and support to Neighbors A in the situation.\n5. Neighbors B reminds Neighbors A about taking responsibility for their mistakes in the past and learning from them.\n6. Neighbors B appreciates Neighbors A's handy skills.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided contains sentences that display an interaction where Neighbor A had previously apologized to Neighbor B for their behavior. This is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT because Neighbor B mentions remembering a time when Neighbor A apologized, which links directly to MEMORY sentences 1, 2, and 3. The MEMORY includes, to some extent, causality and development of past interactions between the neighbors, such as acknowledgment of mistakes and supportiveness (sentence 4). However, some sentences (5 and 6) are less directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT or do not contribute significantly to understanding the specific past exchanges related to the current topic of conversation. Overall, while there is relevant and useful information, not all sentences are naturally connected or beneficial in generating a response to the current dialogue context."
