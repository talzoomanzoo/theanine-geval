Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria. Co-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A.\n2. Co-worker B reminds Co-worker A of their progress and potential for success.\n3. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n4. Co-workers A and B have worked together on a big story in the past.\n5. Co-worker B points out that Co-worker A doesn't always consider how their actions can affect others.\n6. Co-worker A appreciates Co-worker B's support and plans to perform in the final round of the competition.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains some helpful information for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It indicates that Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A, which might suggest a positive and friendly relationship. The mention of their past collaboration on a big story provides context about their work relationship and suggests a level of familiarity and camaraderie. However, the MEMORY also includes information that is not directly relevant to the current conversation, such as Co-worker B's reminder about Co-worker A's potential or the final round of a competition. While these details help characterize the relationship between the two co-workers, they are not directly connected to the current context of planning lunch. Overall, the MEMORY offers some contextual cues but does not clearly demonstrate the development or causality in the dialogue."
