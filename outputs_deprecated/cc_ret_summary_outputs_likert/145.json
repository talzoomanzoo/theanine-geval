Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water? Neighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for. Neighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit. Neighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water. Neighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n2. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n3. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n4. Neighbors A and B have not seen each other in a while and are catching up.\n5. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n6. Neighbors A and B are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information about Neighbor A and Neighbor B's relationship, such as their familiarity and supportive nature, which could potentially be helpful if the DIALOGUE CONTEXT were different. However, the majority of the MEMORY entries are not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT focused on a conflict over a joke involving cold water. The past interactions mentioned in MEMORY do not provide clear contextual cues or connections to the current conversation, making it difficult for the language model to generate an appropriate response based on MEMORY. While MEMORY reflects a generally friendly relationship, it lacks specific relevant development or causality that would clarify the conflict seen in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
