Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. Neighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly.\n2. Neighbor B reminds Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them.\n3. Neighbor A started construction on the house last week and plans to finish it in record time.\n4. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n5. Neighbor A has skills in manipulation and getting what they want.\n6. Neighbors A values their friendship with Neighbors B, describing them as a great neighbor.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided has limited helpfulness in creating a relevant next response for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the MEMORY captures certain aspects of the relationship and abilities between Neighbor A and Neighbor B, such as Neighbor A's skills in construction and their friendship, it does not provide information directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on procrastination and the challenge of meeting a project deadline. The MEMORY's elements like building houses quickly or considering using skills for good are not directly tied to the conversation about procrastination, and the sentences are not closely connected to show the development of these specific past interactions to help with generating the next response. The connection between MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is somewhat weak, thus making it difficult for a language model to use this MEMORY effectively for the current context."
