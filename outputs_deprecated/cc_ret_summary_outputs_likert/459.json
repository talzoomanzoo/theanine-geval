Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together. Neighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left? Neighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him. Neighbors B: That's not true, Neighbor A. You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are. Neighbors A: I just feel so lost right now. I don't know how to move on from this.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A appreciates the emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during their time of grief.\n2. Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.\n3. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n4. Neighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there.\n5. Neighbor A finds solace in nature and believes that it helps in coping with their emotions.\n6. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have a close friendship and have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it lacks direct relevance to the immediate situation discussed in the context. The MEMORY indicates that Neighbor A values emotional support from Neighbor B, which can be relevant as Neighbor B is providing support in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It also highlights their close friendship and shared experiences, which might inform the nature of support Neighbor B can provide. However, the MEMORY contains several elements that are not directly related to the context of a breakup, such as the loss of a grandmother and recently moving to a new neighborhood, thus diluting its overall relevance. While the MEMORY is naturally phrased, it does not fully capture the past interactions that are most pertinent to the current situation of relationship heartbreak and guidance on moving forward."
