    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water? Neighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n2. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n3. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n4. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n5. Neighbor A's mom scolds them for ripping off the tag from their new shirt.\n6. Neighbors A and B have not seen each other in a while and are catching up.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for understanding the dynamics between Neighbors A and B. Sentences 1, 3, 4, and 6 suggest a friendly or familiar relationship between the neighbors which can provide context to the playful yet seemingly frustrated dialogue. These sentences show past interactions that highlight the camaraderie between them. Sentence 2 complements this by indicating that Neighbor B is generally supportive, which might add an emotional layer to the current exchange. However, sentence 5 about Neighbor A's mom scolding them seems unrelated to the context and does not provide any relevant connection to their dialogue about the cold water incident. Although the MEMORY includes some relevant interactions, the connections between these past interactions and the current event aren't fully fleshed out, making it moderately helpful in predicting the next response."
