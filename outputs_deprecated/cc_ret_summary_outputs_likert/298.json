Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message. Co-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident. Co-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows. Co-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive. Co-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right. Co-workers B: Speaking of convincing people, have you ever been in a physical altercation before? Co-workers A: Yes, unfortunately. But that doesn't mean I'm a danger to people. I just don't back down from a fight when I'm standing up for what's right. Co-workers B: That's understandable. Speaking of standing up for what's right, do you remember when you asked Karen for money and she was hesitant at first? Co-workers A: Yeah, I remember. But she eventually gave me the cash, and I was able to take care of what I needed to. Co-workers B: That's good. And speaking of taking care of things, your carpentry skills are amazing. I loved the house you built for me last year. Co-workers A: Thanks! I really love building houses. It's a great feeling to take a blueprint and turn it into someone's dream home.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A is a skilled builder who recently completed building a house for Co-worker B.\n2. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs.\n3. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument.\n4. Co-worker A has experience dealing with challenging clients and emphasizes the importance of communication and setting expectations.\n5. Co-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\n6. Co-worker A has presented evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful and relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures key aspects of Co-worker A's abilities and past experiences that are discussed in the conversation, such as their public speaking skills, ability to stand up for their beliefs, and carpentry skills. The memories of Co-worker A presenting evidence and standing up in court relate directly to the conversation about debate skills. The memory about Co-worker A building a house for Co-worker B ties into the part of the conversation where Co-worker B praises Co-worker A's carpentry skills.\n\nHowever, it includes a point about Co-worker A dealing with challenging clients, which is not directly relevant to the current dialogue context. Additionally, while the sentences in MEMORY are naturally structured, they could be more connected in terms of demonstrating the continuity of interaction between the two speakers.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is closely aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and provides helpful cues for a language model to generate responses, but slight improvements in phrasing and connection could enhance its usefulness."
