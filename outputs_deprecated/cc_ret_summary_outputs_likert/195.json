Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel really fulfilled as a leader and guide. Helping others gives me a sense of purpose. Co-workers B: I can see that. You always seem to know just what to do to make people feel better. Co-workers A: Yeah, I've had a lot of practice over the years. It's just something that comes naturally to me. Co-workers B: Do you remember that time when you were led to a safe place by the commander? You must have felt pretty grateful for his guidance then.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A had a positive experience with a commander who helped them feel safe.\n2. Co-worker B values finding fulfillment in work, pursuing hobbies, making a difference in the world, and building relationships with others.\n3. Co-worker B emphasizes the importance of acknowledging privileges and using them to make the world a better place.\n4. Co-worker B offers encouragement and believes things will work out in the end.\n5. Co-worker A believes that making money can lead to fulfillment and provide the freedom to pursue hobbies and interests.\n6. Co-worker A believes that everyone has the ability to create opportunities and make their own luck through hard work and seizing opportunities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, that was a really impactful experience for me. It showed me the importance of feeling safe and supported in order to truly thrive in any situation. The commander's guidance made a big difference in how I viewed leadership and support.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about the past interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, such as #1, which directly aligns with the specific event mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This memory about the commander's help complements the current conversation. However, the other pieces of MEMORY, such as #2 to #6, are not directly connected to the current dialogue context. They provide some context about the characters' beliefs and values, which may offer a broader understanding of their personalities, but are not directly relevant to generating a response based on the existing conversation about leadership and guidance. The MEMORY structure is somewhat useful but could improve in integrating more relevant connections to the dialogue context to score higher."
