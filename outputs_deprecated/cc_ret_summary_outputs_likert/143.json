    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water? Neighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for. Neighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n2. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n3. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n4. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n5. Neighbors A and B have not seen each other in a while and are catching up.\n6. Neighbor A's mom scolds them for ripping off the tag from their new shirt.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I know you were just having fun, but I really don't like being pushed into cold water. Let's find some other ways to joke around that we both enjoy.",
    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, especially points 1, 2, and 3, which indicate a supportive and considerate relationship between the neighbors. Point 3 adds context on the familiarity and shared history between Neighbor A and Neighbor B, which might be useful for generating more personalized dialogue. However, points 4 and 5 are not directly related to the current conversation about the prank involving cold water, though they do hint at past discussions. Point 6 seems unrelated to the neighbors' interactions entirely. The MEMORY could be more effectively structured to highlight connections to the current dialogue, which hinders its overall helpfulness score."
