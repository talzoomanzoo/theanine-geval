Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on. Child: What is it, Parent?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Child is caring and offers help to the Parent.\n2. The Parent is working and feels tired after a long day.\n3. The parent and child have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores.\n4. The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings.\n5. The Child offers to bring water or make soup for the Parent while they are resting.\n6. The Child supports the idea of the Parent adopting more children and hopes for a happy home for them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": " It's a big project that requires a lot of time and effort. I want to make sure I can balance it with everything else going on at home.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains sentences that provide some helpful contextual information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it also includes information that is not directly relevant. \n\n- Sentences 1 and 5 indicate that the Child is caring and supportive, which is relevant because it suggests the Child may offer help or express interest in the Parent’s new project.\n- Sentence 2 provides context about the Parent's work and tiredness, which could be related since the Parent mentions a new project, possibly indicating more work.\n- Sentence 3 is not directly tied to the new project but shows open communication, which might imply that the conversation will be supportive and informative.\n- Sentence 4 provides insight into the Parent's desires, which might not be directly relevant to the discussion about the new project but adds to the understanding of the Parent’s character.\n- Sentence 6, regarding adopting more children, seems unrelated to the current dialogue about a project.\n\nOverall, while there are elements of the memory that set the tone for a positive and open conversation, not all the details are directly beneficial for generating a response about the specific project. Sentences are mostly well-connected, but there is some irrelevant information."
