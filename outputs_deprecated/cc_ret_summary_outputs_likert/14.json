    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends. Mentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections. Mentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here. Mentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n2. Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process.\n3. The Mentee has been offered a job and has decided to take the job in the city.\n4. The Mentee weighed the pros and cons of each option before deciding on the job in the city.\n5. Mentor emphasizes the importance of self-care for dealing with challenges.\n6. The Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains pieces of information that could be helpful in generating a next response, but lacks strong direct connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, sentences 1 and 5 align partially with the current context as they pertain to general emotional support and reassurance, suggesting that the Mentor has been a supportive figure in Mentee's life. However, the context revolves around loneliness and adapting to a new city, while MEMORY includes details focused on Mentee's job decisions and stress related to the college application process (sentences 2, 3, 4), which are not directly related to the current dialogue. Sentence 6 implies a trusting relationship between the Mentee and Mentor, which can help the language model to infer a tone, but the rest of the details aren't particularly helpful for generating a response focused on the emotional aspect of adapting to a new environment, which is the core of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it contained information specifically about previous discussions around loneliness, socializing, or living in a new city."
