Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Thank you for finding my glasses for me, Mentor. I always seem to misplace them. Mentor: Not a problem, Mentee. I'm glad I could help. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentee credits Mentor for their help in achieving sobriety and expresses gratitude for the support.\n2. Mentor acknowledges Mentee's achievements and provides ongoing support and guidance.\n3. Mentor is willing to share their knowledge with Mentee and help them achieve their goals.\n4. Mentor is proud of Mentee for making positive changes and taking control of their life.\n5. The Mentor is supportive of the Mentee's approach and encourages them to continue.\n6. Mentor has been supportive of Mentee's journey to sobriety.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about the relationship between the Mentor and Mentee, primarily focusing on mentor's support in the mentee's journey to sobriety and self-improvement. These details could be somewhat helpful to a language model when generating a next response if the dialogue context touches upon broader themes of support or personal improvement. However, the specific context given is about a simple, everyday situation concerning misplacing glasses, and the MEMORY does not directly relate to this context. While the MEMORY describes the nature of the Mentor- Mentee relationship effectively, it does not strongly provide information relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about glasses. The sentences are connected and natural, which helps in understanding the interactions and dynamic between the two speakers, but lacks direct pertinence to the specific context at hand."
