    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on. Child: What is it, Parent? Parent: I created a website where I post advertisements, and people can pay to see them. Child: Oh, that's interesting. How does it work? Parent: Well, I create the ads myself, and then I post them on my website. People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them. Child: Do you think people will pay to see your ads? Parent: I don't know yet, but I hope so. I've put a lot of effort into creating some eye-catching ads. Child: That sounds cool, but why do you want to make money from ads?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Child supports the idea of the Parent adopting more children and hopes for a happy home for them.\n2. The Child is caring and offers help to the Parent.\n3. The parent and child have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores.\n4. The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings.\n5. The Parent is working and feels tired after a long day.\n6. The Parent expresses a desire to adopt more children in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that is not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the Parent's new project concerning advertisements on a website. The MEMORY focuses on general traits and interactions like open communication, the Parent's desire to be a better role model, and thoughts on adoption, which do not provide clear contextual cues for generating the next response related to the current topic of conversation. While some aspects like open communication might imply a supportive relationship, they do not directly aid in advancing the dialogue on the specific topic of the website project or ads. The connection between sentences in MEMORY and their relevance to DIALOGUE CONTEXT is limited, hence the score of 2."
