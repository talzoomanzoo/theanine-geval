Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend! Co-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang. Co-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together.\n2. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n3. Co-worker B is married and had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends.\n4. Co-worker A and Co-worker B used to work together at a clothing store.\n5. Co-worker A and Co-worker B are both excited about payday and being able to pay off bills.\n6. Co-worker A is observant and did some research on social media to find out that Co-worker B is married.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information about past interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, such as sharing happy memories, previously working together, and excitement about payday. However, the majority of the sentences are not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Co-worker A singing at church. The MEMORY lacks a clear connection or causality that could help generate a well-informed response based on the dialogue context. While some sentences hint at a shared past, they are not cohesively structured or directly pertain to the subject of the current dialogue. Additionally, some of the sentences (e.g., Co-worker A researching Co-worker B's marital status) do not seem to provide beneficial context for the given dialogue. Therefore, based on these observations, the MEMORY's helpfulness in informing the next response is limited."
