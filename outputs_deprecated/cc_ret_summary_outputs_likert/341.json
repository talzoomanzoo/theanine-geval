Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm really excited about finding a buyer for my product. I think it has a lot of potential. Neighbors B: That's great to hear, what kind of product is it? Neighbors A: It's a new type of workout equipment that's designed to be more efficient than traditional equipment. I've been working on it for months now and I really think it's going to take off. Neighbors B: Wow, that sounds interesting. Have you started looking for potential buyers? Neighbors A: Yes, I've been reaching out to various gyms and fitness centers to see if they'd be interested in carrying the product. I've even gotten some positive feedback from a few places. Neighbors B: That's awesome! I'm sure with your determination, you'll find the perfect buyer soon.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's efforts to change and become a better version of themselves.\n2. Neighbors B expresses a desire for Neighbors A to succeed and emphasizes the importance of treating others with respect and putting in effort at work.\n3. Neighbors A is trying to improve their behavior at work and be a better colleague.\n4. Neighbors A and Neighbors B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as they enjoy having coffee and chatting together.\n5. Neighbors A acknowledges the need to work harder, be nicer to colleagues, and improve their behavior.\n6. Neighbors B appreciated Neighbors A's support during this difficult situation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided is loosely related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, with some sentences showing a supportive relationship between Neighbors A and B. However, the MEMORY lacks specific information about the product discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as details about the workout equipment or the process of finding buyers. Most of the MEMORY focuses on Neighbors A's personal development and relationship with Neighbors B, which does not directly aid in generating a response related to the product discussion. While the supportive nature is somewhat relevant, the key contextual details needed for the conversation are missing, limiting its helpfulness for generating the next response based on the specific context."
