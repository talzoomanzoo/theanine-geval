    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to share something with you. I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend. Classmates B: That's really kind of you. What did you do to help? Classmates A: She was moving and needed some extra hands to pack up her things and load them onto a truck. So I spent most of the day helping her out. Classmates B: Wow, that's really generous of you. I'm sure your neighbor really appreciated it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B has been supportive and helpful to Classmates A.\n2. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support.\n3. Classmates A appreciates the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n4. Classmates B handled a previous mix-up with the class schedule well, showing responsibility and reliability.\n5. Classmates A and B started as acquaintances and have developed a strong friendship.\n6. Classmates A and B are making plans to spend time together outside of school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks! I just believe in helping out whenever I can. It feels good to make a difference in someone's day.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about the relationship between Classmates A and B, such as their supportive and friendly nature (sentences 1, 2, 3, 5) which can help in understanding the interaction dynamics in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 4, about a mix-up with the class schedule, is not directly related to the current dialogue but adds to B's character as reliable and responsible. Sentence 6 about making plans also indicates a positive relationship but is not directly related to the current context. While the MEMORY contains useful context about the ongoing supportive friendship, it lacks more direct references to specific past interactions that would be helpful for generating the next response in the specific scenario of helping a neighbor. The sentences are mostly relevant but somewhat generic in terms of direct connection to the given Dialogue Context."
