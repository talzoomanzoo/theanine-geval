Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nAthlete: Ted Athlete unrolls the map. He looks at it for a few moments before tracing his finger along one of the highways. \"This is our route,\" he says finally, feeling in control.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Athlete is focused on helping the team succeed and has shown leadership qualities during warm-ups and stretches.\n2. The Coach is giving advice to the Athlete regarding their performance and focus.\n3. The Athlete decides to tough it out and stay focused on the game.\n4. The Athlete is focused on improving their performance and energy levels.\n5. The Coach encourages the Athlete to keep up the good work and acknowledges their achievements.\n6. The Athlete has been taking on more responsibilities and has gained respect from other players.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information about the Athlete's leadership and focus, which could be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Ted Athlete is taking control and deciding the route. The mention of leadership qualities (sentence 1) and the Athlete taking on more responsibilities (sentence 6) are pertinent to the context of routing decisions, which can imply a level of responsibility and leadership. However, several sentences in MEMORY are quite general and don't provide clear links or causality to the current context where the Athlete is determining a route (e.g., sentences 2, 3, 5). These sentences are also more focused on performance in a game setting rather than decision-making or map-reading contexts. Despite this, they are naturally phrased and suggest a broader context of the Athlete's qualities and interactions with the Coach, which can be helpful in generating an appropriate response, but not as directly connected as one might expect for a higher score."
