Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, have you ever tried to imagine what it would be like to think like someone else?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor became a mentor to help others going through similar situations.\n2. Mentee agrees to try the advice and express gratitude towards Mentor.\n3. Mentee has been thinking about helping others who may be in abusive cults.\n4. Mentee agrees to teach in a way that allows people to make their own decisions about their beliefs.\n5. Mentee wants to make a positive impact in people's lives and is grateful for Mentor's support.\n6. Mentor encourages Mentee to approach teaching religion with an open mind and heart.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, it's important to try to see things from different perspectives to truly understand others. It can be a powerful tool in teaching and helping others make their own choices.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY offers some useful insights into the relationship and interactions between the Mentor and Mentee. Points 1, 5, and 6 provide important context for the dialogue, as they show that both parties are interested in helping others and being supportive of each other. Memory point 3 is relevant as it hints that the Mentee is empathetic and concerned about others, possibly aligning with the conversation starter about thinking like someone else. \n\nHowever, not all points are directly relevant to the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT (e.g., points 2 and 4 could be irrelevant or marginally relevant to the cause of thinking like someone else). The sentences describe past interactions and intentions fairly well, but they aren't fully tied into the exploration of imagining other people's thought processes suggested by the context. \n\nOverall, the information is useful but only partially relevant to the immediate dialogue; therefore, the MEMORY earns a mid-range score."
