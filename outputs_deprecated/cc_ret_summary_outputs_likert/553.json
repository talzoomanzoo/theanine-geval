Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret? Neighbors B: Of course, what's up? Neighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door. Neighbors B: Oh, why are you hiding from her? Neighbors A: She wants me to go to a family dinner tonight, but I'm too tired and just want to relax at home. Neighbors B: Maybe you should talk to her about it and let her know how you feel. Neighbors A: I know, but I don't want to disappoint her. Neighbors B: It's important to take care of your own needs and speak up for yourself. Plus, maybe you can compromise and go to the dinner for a little while and then come back home to relax. Neighbors A: That's a good idea, thanks for the advice. Neighbors B: No problem. Speaking of compromise, remember that dinner we went to a few days ago? Neighbors A: Yes, it was so much fun!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor B offers support and suggests planning a dinner to celebrate Neighbor A's new adventures in learning.\n2. Neighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation.\n3. Neighbors A enjoys trying new things, like new recipes.\n4. Neighbors B is excited and supportive of Neighbors A's new ability.\n5. Neighbors A made a roasted vegetable and quinoa dish that Neighbors B enjoyed.\n6. Neighbors B is open to trying new recipes and is excited to receive the chickpea curry recipe from Neighbors A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

I'd love to try out another one of your delicious recipes like that roasted vegetable and quinoa dish you made. And I can't wait to try out that chickpea curry recipe you mentioned!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY does not provide much information that is directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around Neighbor A hiding from their mom to avoid going to a family dinner, while the MEMORY focuses more on food-related interactions and recipe exchanges between Neighbors A and B. There is a slight connection with the mention of dinner in both the context and MEMORY, but it does not enhance the understanding of the current conversation. The MEMORY lacks causality and development directly related to the context of skipping a family dinner, hiding, and discussing needs with Neighbor B, making it less useful for generating a response. However, the memories are naturally phrased and structured, which somewhat aids in understanding the relationship dynamics between the neighbors, thus avoiding the lowest score."
