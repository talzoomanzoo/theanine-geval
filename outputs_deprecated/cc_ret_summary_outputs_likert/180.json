Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today. Wife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful.\n2. The husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that make him happy outside of work and family life.\n3. The husband enjoys being outside and loves the weather after being stuck indoors at work.\n4. The husband feels happy and content being outside in the beautiful weather.\n5. The wife is glad to see the husband finding a sense of purpose and being happy.\n6. The husband values spending time with his friend, feeling happy and content with their company.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information that could be helpful for understanding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the importance of small gestures in the couple's relationship and the husband's enjoyment of activities outside of work. However, many of the sentences in MEMORY are not directly relevant to the specific dialogue provided. For instance, the husband's contentment with the weather or spending time with a friend does not have a clear connection to the dialogue about hanging lights and candles. While the sentences are naturally structured, they do not provide substantial contextual cues that would directly aid in generating a subsequent response to the dialogue."
