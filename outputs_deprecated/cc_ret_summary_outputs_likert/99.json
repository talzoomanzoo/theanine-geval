Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager! Co-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role. Co-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge. Co-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail. Co-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products. Co-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader? Co-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago. Co-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality. Co-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes. But it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Remember when I was really stressed about you not liking me? Co-workers B: Yeah, I remember. But we worked through it, didn't we?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader.\n2. Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n3. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n4. Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\n5. Co-worker B acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress.\n6. Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information for the language model to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. Memory Sentence 1 reflects Co-worker B's encouragement and perception of Co-worker A's leadership qualities, aligning with the dialogue context where Co-worker B expresses confidence in Co-worker A's abilities.\n2. Memory Sentence 2 is relevant as it mentions Co-worker A's fantasies about being a great leader, which connects to the dialogue where past fantasies and current opportunities are discussed.\n3. Memory Sentence 3 gives insight into Co-worker A's growth and confidence, which ties into their new promotion and readiness to take on challenges.\n4. Memory Sentence 4 repeats the idea from Sentence 2, showing consistency in Co-worker A's long-held aspirations.\n5. Memory Sentence 5 shows Co-worker B's support for Co-worker A, reflecting the supportive interaction in DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n6. Memory Sentence 6 is connected, as it relates to Co-worker A considering new responsibilities, aligning with their reflection on leadership.\n\nWhile there is some redundancy between some memory sentences (e.g., 2 and 4), overall, the MEMORY provides a coherent backdrop of past interactions, growth, and aspirations that enrich the context of current achievements and future responsibilities discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences are naturally connected, aiding a language model in understanding the development of conversations between the co-workers."
