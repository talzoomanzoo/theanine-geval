Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n2. Co-worker B is married and had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends.\n3. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together.\n4. Co-worker A is observant and did some research on social media to find out that Co-worker B is married.\n5. Co-worker A and Co-worker B used to work together at a clothing store.\n6. Co-worker A has a talent for solving puzzles and mysteries.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's amazing! I bet you sounded fantastic. How did it feel to sing in front of everyone?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information regarding past interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, but not much of it is directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT provided, where Co-worker A mentions singing a solo at church. Points 1, 4, and 5 give some context about their workplace relationship and Co-worker B's marital status, but these details don't significantly impact the context of Co-worker A's singing experience. Point 3, which mentions shared happy memories, could vaguely relate to the shared experience context, but is not mentioned in detail. The rest, such as Co-worker A's talent for solving puzzles, is irrelevant to the singing context. Overall, the MEMORY provides little helpful information for generating a relevant response to Co-worker A's statement about singing at church."
