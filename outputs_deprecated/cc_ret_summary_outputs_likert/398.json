    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing! Neighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go? Neighbors A: I visited Brazil and Peru. The culture and food were incredible. Neighbors B: That sounds awesome. I've always wanted to go to Peru to see Machu Picchu. Neighbors A: Yes, Machu Picchu is amazing. The view from the top is breathtaking. Neighbors B: Have you thought about where you want to go next? Neighbors A: Yeah, I'm thinking about visiting Australia and Antarctica next. I want to see the Great Barrier Reef and the penguins. Neighbors B: Wow, that's quite a contrast. From the hot desert to the cold ice. It must be interesting to experience such different environments.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's organization skills and wishes to improve their own organization.\n2. Neighbors A and B believe in doing nice things for others to bring the community together.\n3. Neighbors A and B both took a cooking class together last year.\n4. Both Neighbors A and B believe in the importance of learning and self-improvement.\n5. Neighbor B suggests finding other ways to relieve frustration and looking out for Neighbor A's well-being.\n6. Neighbor A is feeling frustrated and is considering going to a bar to find someone for a casual encounter.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, I love exploring different environments and experiencing new things. It's always good to push ourselves out of our comfort zones and learn about different cultures and landscapes.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about the relationship between Neighbors A and B, such as their shared belief in learning and self-improvement, and their previous activities together. However, these do not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT which is centered around Neighbors A's travel experiences and future plans. The memory about organization skills and the suggestion to relieve frustration or seek a casual encounter may hint at past interactions but are not helpful for generating a next response based on the current conversation. The lack of direct connection or relevance to the present travel-focused dialogue limits the helpfulness of the MEMORY."
