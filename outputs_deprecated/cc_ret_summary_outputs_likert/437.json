Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria. Co-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking? Co-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you? Co-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you. Co-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B reminds Co-worker A of their progress and potential for success.\n2. Co-worker B has moved on from their arrest and appreciates Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior.\n3. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n4. Co-workers A and B have worked together on a big story in the past.\n5. Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A.\n6. Co-worker B points out that Co-worker A doesn't always consider how their actions can affect others.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that can help the language model generate a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, points 1, 3, and 6 highlight aspects of the relationship between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, such as encouragement, reassurance, and a perspective on Co-worker A's behavior. These elements can contribute to understanding the context and dynamic between the two speakers. In addition, point 2 provides background about Co-worker B's past (arrest), which might be relevant to the discussion of irresponsibility mentioned in the context.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY also contains information that is not directly pertinent to the specific context or is somewhat vague, such as point 4 regarding working on a big story, which lacks specifics. Overall, while the MEMORY provides some context, it lacks cohesive development and causality that directly ties into the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, resulting in a moderate score. \n\nThe sentences are generally well-phrased, but the helpfulness could be improved with clearer connections between MEMORY and DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
