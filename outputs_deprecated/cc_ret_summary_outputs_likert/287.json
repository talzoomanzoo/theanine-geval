Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away. Co-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that. Co-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way. Co-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you. Co-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it. Co-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on. Co-workers A: I know you're right, Co-workers B. I just don't know how to get over this feeling. Co-workers B: Maybe try talking to someone about it. A therapist or a trusted friend. They can help you work through these emotions in a healthy way.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n3. Co-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity.\n4. Co-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\n5. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\n6. Co-worker A is trying to stay positive and focus on their recovery, despite it being a daunting task.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you for always being there for me, Co-worker B. Your support means a lot during this difficult time. I'll consider seeking help to work through these overwhelming emotions.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that can aid in generating an appropriate response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, sentences 1 and 2 relate directly to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT because they mention the incident with the pencil, providing evidence of past interactions that can offer context to Co-worker A's character and behavior. However, sentences 3 to 6 introduce unrelated information that does not provide further meaningful insight into their current conversation, as they do not tie back to the topic of Co-worker A's feelings towards the bride or the analogy with the pencil. Overall, while there is some helpful context provided, there is also inclusion of information that doesn't appear to be relevant or cohesively lead to generating a response, warranting a middle score."
