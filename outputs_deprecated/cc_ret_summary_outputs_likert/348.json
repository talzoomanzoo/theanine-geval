Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me. Co-workers B: That's amazing to hear. Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job. Co-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A is grateful for life experiences and is open to new possibilities in the future.\n2. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.\n3. Co-worker A felt remorse for what they did and appreciated Co-worker B's understanding.\n4. Co-worker B emphasized the importance of learning from mistakes and working together as a team.\n5. Co-worker A has grown as a person and as an artist, learning about empathy and compassion.\n6. Co-worker A and Co-worker B are excited about working on future projects together and even starting their own production company someday.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad to hear that. It's great to see how your positive attitude and hard work have paid off.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT, though it lacks a strong direct connection to the specific conversation about having a supportive boss. Here are the observations:\n\n1. Sentence 2 mentions their collaboration, which could hint at a supportive work environment, aligning somewhat with Co-worker A's feelings of security and motivation due to a supportive boss.\n2. Sentence 4 on learning from mistakes and teamwork, and Sentence 6 on future collaboration, suggest a positive and supportive professional relationship, which indirectly relates to the benefits of having a supportive boss.\n3. However, several sentences (e.g., Sentence 1 about life experiences, Sentence 3 about remorse, Sentence 5 about personal growth) do not directly connect to the context of appreciating a boss's support.\n\nOverall, while thereâ€™s some relevance through shared experiences and teamwork interactions, the memories aren't specifically focused on the supportive boss aspect and therefore partially meet the criterion."
