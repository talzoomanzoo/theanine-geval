Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Thank you for finding my glasses for me, Mentor. I always seem to misplace them.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentee credits Mentor for their help in achieving sobriety and expresses gratitude for the support.\n2. Mentor acknowledges Mentee's achievements and provides ongoing support and guidance.\n3. Mentee admires Mentor's success and wants to learn from them.\n4. Mentor is proud of Mentee for making positive changes and taking control of their life.\n5. Mentor has been supportive of Mentee's journey to sobriety.\n6. Mentor is willing to share their knowledge with Mentee and help them achieve their goals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "No problem at all, Mentee. I'm always here to help you out. It's great to see you making progress in all aspects of your life, including keeping track of your glasses. Let me know if you need help with anything else.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes a relationship of support and guidance between the Mentor and Mentee, indicating that the Mentor is someone the Mentee relies on for help, which aligns with the Mentee thanking the Mentor for finding their glasses. However, the MEMORY primarily focuses on the Mentee's journey to sobriety and achievement, which is not directly related to the immediate context of the Mentee misplacing their glasses. The MEMORY sentences are well-structured and demonstrate development in the Mentor-Mentee relationship, but they do not contribute significantly to generating a response about the current context of misplacing glasses. A higher score would require more directly relevant information to the specific interaction in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
