Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly. Neighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit? Neighbors A: It was Chicago. I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations. Neighbors B: I bet it was a nice change of scenery from our neighborhood. Neighbors A: Definitely. But you know, it's interesting how much our neighborhood has grown on me over the years. I remember when I first moved here, I was so unsure about it. Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember. But you stayed because you wanted to be here. Neighbors A: That's right. And since then, I've made so many great memories here. It's become my home. Neighbors B: And you're still spending time with God every day, right? Neighbors A: Yes, I am. It brings me so much peace and happiness. Neighbors B: That's really admirable. And speaking of power, I remember you telling me about that time when you could make me do anything you wanted. Neighbors A: Oh, gosh. That was so long ago. I can't even believe I had that kind of power over you. Neighbors B: I'm just glad we've both grown since then, and we can have a friendship that's based on mutual respect.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A enjoys living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbor A has been living in the same place for a long time and enjoys the neighborhood and people there.\n3. Neighbors B has been living in the neighborhood for some time and is supportive of Neighbors A.\n4. Neighbors A values the relationship with Neighbors B and considers them like family.\n5. Neighbors B acknowledges Neighbors A's friendly and outgoing nature.\n6. Neighbors A is excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, our friendship means the world to me. It's amazing how much we've both grown and evolved over the years. I'm so grateful to have you in my life as a friend and neighbor.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Points 1 and 4 relate to Neighbors A's feelings about living in the neighborhood and their relationship with Neighbors B, which aligns with Neighbors A's reflection on how the neighborhood has grown on them and their relationship with Neighbors B. This provides context for their positive ties with Neighbors B, supporting Neighbors A's sentiment of having made great memories.\n\nHowever, much of the MEMORY is not directly linked to the specific events or growth mentioned in the context, such as the discussion about Chicago or past experiences of trust and influence. Sentences 2, 3, 5, and 6, while describing neighborhood life and character traits, do not clearly connect to or develop the dialogue's focus beyond what is already inferred.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY captures the essence of the neighborhood camaraderie and connection but lacks specific context cues that would enhance understanding of significant past shared experiences or detailed personal interactions noted in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
