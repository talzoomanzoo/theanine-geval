Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life. Child: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you. Parent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The child is supportive and caring towards the parent.\n2. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n3. Both the parent and child express love and support for each other.\n4. The child is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes.\n5. The child offers help and reassurance to the parent.\n6. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I agree, it's so comforting to know that you're always there to listen to me. Your support means everything to me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: MEMORY contains multiple sentences that provide useful context related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it easier for a language model to generate appropriate responses. Sentences like \"The child is supportive and caring towards the parent,\" \"Both the parent and child express love and support for each other,\" and \"The child offers help and reassurance to the parent\" align with the supportive and caring dynamic present in the dialogue context and provide helpful context about the relationship dynamic. Moreover, these sentences are structured clearly and are naturally connected, reflecting the development and positivity of past interactions, which helps in maintaining narrative continuity and identifying critical interaction patterns. However, not every sentence directly ties into the current topic of conversation about listening, hence preventing a perfect score."
