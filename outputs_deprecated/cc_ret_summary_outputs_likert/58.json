Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today. Classmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about? Classmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held. Classmates B: Wow, that does sound interesting. Did you take any notes? Classmates A: Yes, I took lots of notes. I'm excited to study this topic more on my own time. Classmates B: That's awesome. It's great to see your enthusiasm for learning. Classmates A: Thanks. I've always been passionate about learning new things. Remember when we talked about how determined I was to get into college? Classmates B: Yeah, I remember. You were always studying and taking extra classes. Classmates A: And now, after all that hard work, I am actually in college. It just goes to show that with dedication, you can achieve your goals. Classmates B: That's so inspiring. It also reminds me of when you wore your pajamas to school. You were always doing something different and unique. Classmates A: Haha, yeah, I remember that. But hey, being a little weird sometimes adds some fun and excitement to life. Speaking of exciting things, I met the girl of my dreams a couple of years ago at a party. Classmates B: Aww, that's fantastic. How has everything been going with her?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A met the girl of their dreams at a party and have been texting her nonstop.\n2. Classmates A feels like everything is falling into place and is excited to see where the new relationship goes.\n3. Classmates B recalls a funny moment from high school involving Classmates A wearing pajamas to school.\n4. Classmates B is supportive of Classmates A's new relationship and believes they found someone who makes them happy.\n5. Classmates A is determined to make the relationship work, similar to their determination to get into college.\n6. Classmates A is dedicated to studying hard and taking extra classes to get into a good college.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's been going really well. I'm excited to see where this new relationship goes. She makes me really happy, and I'm determined to make it work. Just like how I was determined to get into college.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided is closely related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and offers relevant information that can aid in generating a proper next response. The MEMORY contains several important pieces of information: Classmates A meeting the girl of their dreams at a party and being in continuous communication, the support from Classmates B towards Classmates A's relationship, references to Classmates A's determination and enthusiasm in both relationships and academics. This establishes a coherent development and connection between these aspects of Classmates A's life. However, the information is slightly repetitive, and a more integrated connection between the different points could improve it further, hence not the highest score. Nonetheless, it does clearly outline significant past interactions referenced in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
