Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel really fulfilled as a leader and guide. Helping others gives me a sense of purpose. Co-workers B: I can see that. You always seem to know just what to do to make people feel better. Co-workers A: Yeah, I've had a lot of practice over the years. It's just something that comes naturally to me. Co-workers B: Do you remember that time when you were led to a safe place by the commander? You must have felt pretty grateful for his guidance then. Co-workers A: Absolutely. It was a really tough time and I was so relieved to have someone show me the way. I try to pay it forward by being that kind of leader for others. Co-workers B: That's a great attitude to have. Speaking of leadership, do you think you would ever want to take on a higher position in the company? Co-workers A: I'm always open to new opportunities, but I don't want to do it just for the sake of having more power. If I could make a bigger difference in that role, then I would consider it. Co-workers B: I have no doubt that you would do an amazing job. Your skills as a leader and guide are top-notch.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A had a positive experience with a commander who helped them feel safe.\n2. Co-worker B values finding fulfillment in work, pursuing hobbies, making a difference in the world, and building relationships with others.\n3. Co-worker B emphasizes the importance of acknowledging privileges and using them to make the world a better place.\n4. Co-worker A believes that making money can lead to fulfillment and provide the freedom to pursue hobbies and interests.\n5. Co-worker A believes that everyone has the ability to create opportunities and make their own luck through hard work and seizing opportunities.\n6. Co-worker B offers encouragement and believes things will work out in the end.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you for your confidence in me. I appreciate your support and encouragement. It means a lot coming from someone I respect like you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information that is related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it lacks coherence and doesn't provide a clear, connected narrative of the past interactions between the two co-workers. While Memory 1 is relevant, as it echoes Co-worker A's experience mentioned in the context, other memories such as 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 do not directly connect with the dialogue context about leadership and career development. The sentences are standalone facts about the co-workers that do not aid in generating a specific next response for the given dialogue, as they lack natural structure and connectivity to the context. They also do not directly demonstrate the development or causality of the interactions in question."
