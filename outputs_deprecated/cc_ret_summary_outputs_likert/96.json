Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager!

Co-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products. Co-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader? Co-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader.\n2. Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\n3. Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n4. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n5.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory entries capture the encouragement and support Co-worker B provides to Co-worker A, which aligns with their supportive interaction in the current dialogue. The references to Co-worker A's past fantasies of becoming a leader and Co-worker B's acknowledgment of A's growth are naturally connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Co-worker A shares news about their promotion. These points highlight the development of Co-worker A's career and desires, which is relevant to the current conversation. However, some sentences could benefit from clearer phrasing regarding their connection to the present dialogue, such as the specific instances of past encouragement or growth. Overall, the memory captures the essence of the relationship and development, making it helpful for understanding the context and generating a response."
