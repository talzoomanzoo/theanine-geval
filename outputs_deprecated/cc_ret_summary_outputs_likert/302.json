Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to share something with you. I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend. Classmates B: That's really kind of you. What did you do to help? Classmates A: She was moving and needed some extra hands to pack up her things and load them onto a truck. So I spent most of the day helping her out.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B has been supportive and helpful to Classmates A.\n2. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support.\n3. Classmates B handled a previous mix-up with the class schedule well, showing responsibility and reliability.\n4. Classmates A appreciates the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n5. Classmates A and B are making plans to spend time together outside of school.\n6. Classmates A and B started as acquaintances and have developed a strong friendship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's so thoughtful of you to lend a hand like that. Your kindness never fails to impress me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides general background information on the relationship between Classmates A and B, which is helpful in understanding the context of their interaction. It establishes that Classmates A and B have a supportive and strong friendship, which could be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Classmates B expresses appreciation for Classmates A's kind actions. However, the MEMORY lacks specific details about previous interactions that directly relate to the current context of helping a neighbor. While the sentences are naturally structured and show the development of their friendship, they don't provide direct cues or connections to the specific event discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, the helpfulness is moderate as it gives background context but not specific contextual connections to the present conversation."
