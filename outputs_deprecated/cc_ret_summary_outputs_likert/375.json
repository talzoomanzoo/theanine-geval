Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B are students in the same class.\n2. Classmates A was worried about a situation but it turned out to be not a big deal.\n3. Classmates A offered help and support to Classmates B.\n4. Classmates A invited Classmates B to join the study group together for extra support and studying.\n5. Classmates A and B are close and have a level of trust between them.\n6. Classmates A discovered a secret that Classmates B has been keeping.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that can assist in generating a proper response for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes the relationship between Classmates A and B as being close, with a level of trust (sentence 5), which is relevant given that Classmates A wants to discuss something. The MEMORY also highlights past interactions where Classmates A offered support and invited Classmates B to a study group (sentences 3 and 4), suggesting that Classmates A is caring and supportive. This context helps the language model to anticipate that Classmates A might approach the conversation in a supportive manner. Additionally, the revelation of a secret (sentence 6) hints at potential tension or deeper issues that could be relevant to the current conversation, adding depth to the interactions. The MEMORY is well-structured and the sentences are connected in a way that provides useful contextual cues, making it easier for the model to generate an appropriate response. However, not all sentences are directly relevant to the current context, so a score of 5 is not justified."
