Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I can't believe how honored I am to be part of our class. I feel like we have something special going on here. Classmates B:  You're right. Our class definitely has a unique energy about it. What do you think sets us apart from other classes? Classmates A:  I think it's our sense of community. We all support each other and work together to achieve our goals.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B complimented Classmates A on their suit and brought up a past conversation about feelings.\n2. Classmate B feels relieved that they can still be friends with Classmate A.\n3. Classmates B appreciates Classmates A's honesty about their feelings, but doesn't feel the same way.\n4. Classmates A values their friendship with Classmates B and looks forward to wearing a black suit to a wedding reception.\n5. Despite the rejection, Classmate A values their friendship with Classmate B.\n6. Classmate A has been hiding their feelings for Classmate B and finally confesses to being in love with them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I completely agree. It's amazing how we all come together and lift each other up. It's really something special.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does provide some relevant details about the past interactions between Classmates A and B. It touches on a significant event where Classmate A confessed their feelings towards Classmate B, and how both parties value their friendship despite the lack of reciprocation from Classmate B. However, these sentences do not really aid in advancing the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on a sense of community within the class. The emotions and relationship dynamics shared in MEMORY could add depth to personal interactions but do not seem to directly inform or enhance the ongoing discussion about the class's unique characteristics. Additionally, while the statements are relatively clear and structured, they lack a natural connection or flow that would make them useful in a broader sense. Therefore, while there is some relationship relevance, it is not particularly helpful in generating a response related to community or class dynamics discussed in DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
