    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind? Classmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you. Classmates B: Oh, really? Classmates A: Yes, really. I know we've been friends for a while now, but I feel like there may be something more between us. Classmates B: Hmm, I never thought about it that way. But I can’t deny that we have a great connection. Classmates A: Exactly! I just feel like we could be more than just friends. If it's something you're open to, of course.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B are close and have a level of trust between them.\n2. Classmates A tends to overthink things and appreciated Classmates B's support and advice.\n3. Classmates A discovered a secret that Classmates B has been keeping.\n4. Classmates A and B are students in the same class.\n5. Classmates A and B have had a previous positive interaction in a coffee shop where Classmates A rubbed Classmates B's neck, providing relaxation.\n6. Classmate A recalls a moment where they admired Classmate B's courage and strength in sharing a secret, showing their supportive and compassionate nature.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I really appreciate your honesty and courage in bringing this up. I value our friendship a lot, and I think it’s important for us to have an open and honest conversation about this. Let’s take some time to think about it and discuss it further.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY effectively provides context for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, especially when it comes to the relationship between Classmates A and B. Points 1, 2, and 5 offer relevant background information about the trust and positive interactions between them, which can be helpful for generating an appropriate next response. The fact that they have a strong connection and a history of supporting each other aligns well with Classmate A expressing feelings for Classmate B. However, some points are less directly relevant to the ongoing dialogue, such as point 3 about the secret and point 6 about admiration for courage, which seem somewhat disconnected from the immediate romantic development. Nevertheless, these points are structured in a natural way and offer additional depth to their past interactions, justifying a high score close to 5."
