Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today. Wife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that. Husband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful.\n2. The husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that make him happy outside of work and family life.\n3. The wife is glad to see the husband finding a sense of purpose and being happy.\n4. The husband enjoys being outside and loves the weather after being stuck indoors at work.\n5. The husband feels happy and content being outside in the beautiful weather.\n6. The husband values spending time with his friend, feeling happy and content with their company.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you, it really does make a difference. I appreciate all the effort you put into making our home a cozy retreat.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that is somewhat related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but lacks clear connection or causality relevant to the current interaction between the husband and wife. Sentences 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 all focus on the husband's feelings and activities, which do not directly pertain to the present topic of making the apartment feel cozy and welcoming by adding lights and candles. Sentence 1 is the most relevant as it ties into the context of small actions having meaningful outcomes, which aligns with the couple's appreciation of lights and candles. However, the overall MEMORY lacks coherence and does not effectively demonstrate the development of past interactions in a way that would be useful for generating a next response."
