Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water? Neighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for. Neighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit. Neighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water. Neighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it. Neighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again. Neighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower? Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work. Neighbors A: It was. But it was also a good workout. Neighbors B: I prefer to work out indoors where there's air conditioning. Neighbors A: Ha, I remember when I took off my jacket and put my feet up in your armchair. It was so warm that day. Neighbors B: Yeah, that was a hot day. I'm glad you felt comfortable in my home though.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n2. Both Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\n3. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n4. Neighbors B agrees that mowing the lawn is a lot of work but acknowledges the exercise it provides.\n5. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n6. Neighbors A mentioned mowing the lawn with an old push mower, indicating they are responsible for the yard work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nMEMORY provides some helpful information for the language model to generate a relevant response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures key aspects of the interaction between Neighbors A and B, such as their familiarity with one another (point 3) and reminiscing about past experiences (points 2 and 6). The MEMORY mentions the difficulty of mowing the lawn and that it is recognized as a form of exercise (point 4), which is relevant to the dialogue. However, there are some details (like the suggestion to have extra water on hand in point 5) that are not directly tied to the given dialogue context and offer new information not present in the context. Overall, while MEMORY is connected and relevant, it could be more precise and wholly aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT to offer clearer development cues and a higher score."
