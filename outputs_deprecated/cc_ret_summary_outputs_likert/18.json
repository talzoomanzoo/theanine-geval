Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends. Mentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections. Mentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here. Mentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people. Mentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering. Mentor: And remember, it's also important to keep in touch with your old friends. You can schedule video calls or even plan a visit back home. Mentee: That's true, I'll make sure to keep in touch. Thanks for the advice, Mentor. Mentor: Anytime, Mentee. Is there anything else you want to talk about or any updates you'd like to share?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n2. Mentee agreed to go back to the store to make things right and expressed gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n3. The Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process.\n4. The Mentor is supportive and praises the Mentee for their mature decision-making process.\n5. Mentor advises Mentee to break down studying into manageable chunks, schedule study sessions and breaks, and use resources like practice exams and review books.\n6. Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Actually, I have an update. I followed your advice and joined a club on campus, and I've already met some really nice people. Thank you so much for encouraging me to step out of my comfort zone.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not have considerable relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Although it provides some generic details about the interaction between Mentor and Mentee, such as providing advice and emotional support or guidance in general, these details do not directly relate to the specific situation being discussed in the dialogue context, which is Mentee feeling lonely and looking for ways to make connections in a new city. Most sentences in MEMORY pertain to different scenarios, such as studying or gratitude for past advice, which do not develop the current context of loneliness and making new friends. Therefore, this MEMORY offers limited helpfulness for generating a response appropriate to the dialogue context."
