Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria. Co-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking? Co-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you? Co-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you. Co-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago? Co-workers B: Yeah, I remember that conversation. What about it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B reminds Co-worker A of their progress and potential for success.\n2. Co-workers A and B have worked together on a big story in the past.\n3. Co-worker B has moved on from their arrest and appreciates Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior.\n4. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n5. Co-worker B points out that Co-worker A doesn't always consider how their actions can affect others.\n6. Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I just wanted to say that I really appreciate your honesty and support back then. It really made me reflect on my actions and I've been working on improving myself since then. Thanks for being patient with me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some relevant information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 5 and possibly 1 provide context about past conversations related to Co-worker A's potential irresponsibility, as referenced in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Co-worker A mentions a past discussion about being irresponsible. Sentence 3 also suggests a development or outcome relating to Co-worker B's past, which could be relevant if discussed further. However, other statements such as sentences 2 and 6, although indicative of a supportive relationship, do not directly contribute to the immediate dialogue context. Overall, the MEMORY provides some relevant historical context but lacks stronger direct connections to the current discussion occurring in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences are naturally phrased but only provide partial context for the conversation at hand."
