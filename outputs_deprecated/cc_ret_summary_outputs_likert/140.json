Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that. Neighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset? Neighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore. Neighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it? Neighbors A: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end job. Neighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you considered looking for a new job? Neighbors A: I have, but with the current job market, it's really tough. Plus, I don't have a lot of experience in other fields. Neighbors B: Well, I'll keep an ear out for any job openings that might be a good fit for you. In the meantime, maybe try finding ways to de-stress after work? I find that exercise helps me when I'm feeling frustrated. Neighbors A: That's a good idea. Maybe I'll go for a run later. Thanks for being a supportive neighbor.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\n2. Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received.\n3. Neighbors B recalls when Neighbors A helped with their lawn, showing mutual support between them.\n4. Neighbors A and B are helpful towards each other.\n5. Neighbors A and B live in the same neighborhood and help each other with tasks.\n6. Neighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship as neighbors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY captures the supportive and understanding relationship between Neighbors A and B, as described in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Most of the sentences provide helpful background information that aligns with the supportive interaction seen in the dialogue. Sentences 1, 4, and 6 describe the general supportive relationship, which is directly relevant to the conversation. Sentence 5 gives context about their living situation, which supports the understanding of their neighborly relationship. However, sentences 2 and 3, while supportive and relevant in nature, are not directly helpful in generating a next response for the given dialogue since they introduce additional scenarios not mentioned in the context. The MEMORY is generally well-structured with a natural flow, but the references to specific past events (like helping with the lawn) could be more directly tied to the current context to be even more helpful. Overall, MEMORY is quite useful, achieving a high score for its portrayal of the supportive relationship between the neighbors."
