Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today. Classmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about? Classmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held. Classmates B: Wow, that does sound interesting. Did you take any notes?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B noticed Classmates A's improvement and acknowledged their hard work.\n2. Classmate B is working on finishing a history project.\n3. Classmate B is interested in attending a new technology conference next month.\n4. Classmates A's grades are looking good according to their teacher.\n5. Classmates B recalls a funny moment from high school involving Classmates A wearing pajamas to school.\n6. Classmates A had a moment of frustration in the past but has learned to channel that energy into studies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I took tons of notes! I think it'll be really helpful for our history project too.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers some background information about Classmates A and B but does not directly link or provide relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the talk on the history of the pyramids in Egypt. \n\n1. Sentence 1 suggests a positive relationship between Classmates A and B, indicating that Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's hard work, though it doesn't relate to the current discussion about the pyramid talk.\n2. Sentence 2 mentions that Classmate B is working on a history project, which could potentially relate to the conversation topic of the pyramids. However, it lacks specificity or connection to the actual conversation about the talk.\n3. Sentences 3, 4, and 5 are unrelated to the pyramid or history topic, thus not providing relevant context for generating the next response.\n4. Sentence 6 mentions Classmates A learning to channel frustration into studies, but this background lacks connection to the current context.\n\nOverall, while some memory sentences are naturally phrased, many do not provide direct relevance or assist in generating a suitable follow-up to the given context about the pyramid talk. Thus, only a minimal score is appropriate."
