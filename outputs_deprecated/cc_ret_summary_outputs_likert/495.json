Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today? Classmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own. Classmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others. Classmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone. Classmates A: You're not a burden, don't worry. And I'm always here to help you out. Classmates B: I appreciate that, but I don't want to always rely on others. I want to be more independent. Classmates A: I get it. Maybe there are some small things you can do on your own to start feeling more independent? Classmates B: Like what? Classmates A: Well, maybe you can start by making a list of things you'd like to do on your own and we can work on achieving those goals together. Classmates B: That sounds like a good idea. Thanks for understanding, Classmates A. Classmates A: Of course, I'm always here to support you. Hey, speaking of goals, remember when we talked about your guitar playing a few months ago? How's that going? Classmates B: It's going really well, thanks for asking! I've been practicing every day and I feel like I'm getting better. Classmates A: That's awesome! Have you thought about joining a band or playing gigs around town?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B finds it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after a conversation they had about following dreams.\n2. Classmates A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as evidenced by their conversation about their respective experiences.\n3. Classmates A plays the guitar, takes lessons, and plays in a band.\n4. Classmates A and B enjoy jamming together and plan to collaborate on music in the future.\n5. Classmates B is interested in learning to play an instrument.\n6. Classmates A finds pursuing music rewarding and is passionate about it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information that can be related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly the music aspect. Sentence 6 (\"Classmates A finds pursuing music rewarding and is passionate about it\") and Sentence 3 (\"Classmates A plays the guitar, takes lessons, and plays in a band\") are relevant since Classmates A has asked about Classmates B's guitar practice and potential for gigs or bands. Additionally, Sentence 4 (\"Classmates A and B enjoy jamming together and plan to collaborate on music in the future\") adds context to their ongoing music-related discussions and potential future interactions. \n\nHowever, some sentences, such as Sentence 5 (\"Classmates B is interested in learning to play an instrument\") and Sentence 1 (\"Classmates B finds it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after a conversation they had about following dreams\"), are not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Also, other sentences, like Sentence 2 (\"Classmates A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as evidenced by their conversation about their respective experiences\"), provide generic information about their friendship, which is already evident.\n\nWhile there are helpful elements in the MEMORY, the overall connectivity and development in relation to the current context could be improved for a higher relevance and helpfulness score."
