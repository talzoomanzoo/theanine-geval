Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water? Neighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for. Neighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit. Neighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water. Neighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it. Neighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again. Neighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower? Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work. Neighbors A: It was. But it was also a good workout. Neighbors B: I prefer to work out indoors where there's air conditioning. Neighbors A: Ha, I remember when I took off my jacket and put my feet up in your armchair. It was so warm that day. Neighbors B: Yeah, that was a hot day. I'm glad you felt comfortable in my home though. Neighbors A: You know, I really enjoy spending time with you. I want to get to know you even better. Neighbors B: I feel the same way. We should plan something fun to do together. Neighbors A: Absolutely. Hey, do you remember when I ripped off the tag from my shirt?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n2. Both Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\n3. Neighbors A and B are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together.\n4. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n5. Neighbor A enjoys spending time in Neighbor B's cozy home and wants to hang out more often.\n6. Neighbors A and B plan to work on mowing the lawn together next time to make it easier and possibly discover more things in common.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Haha, yes I remember that! You were so proud of yourself for being able to do that. You're a rebel at heart.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the fact that Neighbors A and B reminisce about past events, both enjoy spending time together, and have conversations about temperature and comfort. However, the MEMORY also includes some information that is not directly connected to the current context or inaccurately describes the interactions, like planning to work on mowing the lawn together, which is not mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the structure of the MEMORY is generally coherent, it lacks explicit causality or clear identification of crucial details needed for generating the next response beyond what is already given in the dialogue. Therefore, it receives a mid-tier score for partially capturing and presenting useful information in a structured manner."
