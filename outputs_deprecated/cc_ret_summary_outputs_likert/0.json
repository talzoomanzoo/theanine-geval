Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The child is supportive and caring towards the parent.\n2. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n3. The parent values independence and self-sufficiency.\n4. Both the parent and child express love and support for each other.\n5. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n6. The child is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information about the relationship between the parent and child, such as mutual support, shared values, and emotional connections. Sentences like \"The child is supportive and caring towards the parent\" and \"The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations\" provide context for the parentâ€™s perspective on being a good listener, which could be connected to the skill they value. However, the connections between these memory points and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT could be more explicitly developed. While the memories demonstrate a supportive and caring relationship that is relevant, they do not directly tie into the specific context of being a good listener. Additionally, the memory points are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear narrative structure, which makes it harder for a model to identify important cues related to the dialogue. Thus, a score of 3 reflects moderate helpfulness, with room for improvement in providing more directly connected and narratively cohesive information."
