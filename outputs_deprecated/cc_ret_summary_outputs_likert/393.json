    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing! Neighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go? Neighbors A: I visited Brazil and Peru. The culture and food were incredible.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and B both took a cooking class together last year.\n2. Neighbors A and B believe in doing nice things for others to bring the community together.\n3. Both Neighbors A and B believe in the importance of learning and self-improvement.\n4. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's organization skills and wishes to improve their own organization.\n5. Neighbors B remembers the incident.\n6. Neighbors A saw George at the store and exchanged waves.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like an incredible experience! Did you take any cooking classes while you were there? I remember how much you enjoyed the one we did together last year.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY does not provide relevant or helpful information for the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context is about Neighbors A's recent trip to South America and their experience visiting Brazil and Peru. However, the MEMORY includes unrelated details about cooking classes, community values, personal admiration, a vague mention of an incident, and a brief encounter with someone named George. These details do not contribute to developing a response related to Neighbors A's travel experience or the specific exchange between the neighbors. Therefore, the MEMORY fails to offer any beneficial contextual cues for generating the next response."
