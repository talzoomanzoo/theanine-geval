    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends. Mentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections. Mentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n2. Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process.\n3. The Mentee has been offered a job and has decided to take the job in the city.\n4. The Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process.\n5. The Mentor is supportive and praises the Mentee for their mature decision-making process.\n6. Mentor emphasizes the importance of self-care for dealing with challenges.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's completely normal to feel that way, Mentee. Remember, it takes time to build new relationships. Just be yourself and don't be afraid to put yourself out there. You'll find your place soon enough. And in the meantime, don't forget to take care of yourself and practice self-care.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains some helpful information that could assist the language model in generating a suitable response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It suggests that the Mentor has previously reassured the Mentee about feeling out of place (Sentence 1) and emphasized the importance of self-care in dealing with challenges (Sentence 6), which is somewhat relevant to the current conversation. However, many of the memory sentences are not directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the Mentee's job decision (Sentence 3) and feelings about college applications (Sentence 2). These sentences add some context about the relationship dynamics, which could be useful, but they are not directly relevant to the Mentee's feelings of loneliness in the current context. Therefore, while MEMORY provides some useful cues, much of it does not offer immediate or directly applicable information to enhance the ongoing dialogue."
