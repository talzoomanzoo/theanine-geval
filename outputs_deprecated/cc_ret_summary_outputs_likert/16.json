Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends. Mentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections. Mentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here. Mentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people. Mentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering. Mentor: And remember, it's also important to keep in touch with your old friends. You can schedule video calls or even plan a visit back home.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n2. Mentee agreed to go back to the store to make things right and expressed gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n3. Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process.\n4. The Mentee has been offered a job and has decided to take the job in the city.\n5. Mentor advises Mentee to break down studying into manageable chunks, schedule study sessions and breaks, and use resources like practice exams and review books.\n6. Mentor emphasizes the importance of self-care for dealing with challenges.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some past interactions between the Mentor and Mentee that might provide a small amount of helpful context for generating a response. For instance, sentence 1 could relate to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT where the Mentor reassures the Mentee similarly about making new connections. However, most of the sentences in the MEMORY are irrelevant to the current conversation about loneliness in a new city and making new friends (e.g., sentences related to the store, college applications, job offer, and studying). Additionally, the sentences are loosely connected and do not clearly demonstrate the development, causality, or relevancy to the current dialogue. Therefore, the overall helpfulness for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is limited."
