Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that. Neighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset? Neighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore. Neighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it? Neighbors A: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end job. Neighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you considered looking for a new job?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\n2. Neighbors A and B are helpful towards each other.\n3. Neighbors A and B live in the same neighborhood and help each other with tasks.\n4. Neighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship as neighbors.\n5. Neighbors B recalls when Neighbors A helped with their lawn, showing mutual support between them.\n6. Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I have thought about it, but I'm not sure where to start. I appreciate you listening and offering your support.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY captures the supportive and understanding nature of Neighbors B towards Neighbors A, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Neighbors B shows empathy and offers advice. It contains relevant information about their relationship dynamics, such as being supportive, understanding, and helping each other with tasks, which helps in understanding the context of their current interaction. However, several points in the MEMORY are quite general and lack specific details related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Neighbors A's frustration with work or Neighbors B's suggestion to look for a new job. While the MEMORY provides some context about their relationship, it does not offer detailed insights into their current problem, limiting its overall helpfulness in generating a next response. Thus, a score of 3 reflects that MEMORY is moderately helpful but could benefit from more specific information directly tied to the current situation."
