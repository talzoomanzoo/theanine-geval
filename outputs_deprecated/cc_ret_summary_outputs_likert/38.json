    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly. Neighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit? Neighbors A: It was Chicago. I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations. Neighbors B: I bet it was a nice change of scenery from our neighborhood. Neighbors A: Definitely. But you know, it's interesting how much our neighborhood has grown on me over the years. I remember when I first moved here, I was so unsure about it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A enjoys living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbors A is excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends.\n3. Neighbor A has been living in the same place for a long time and enjoys the neighborhood and people there.\n4. Neighbors A just moved to a new neighborhood and is getting to know the area.\n5. Neighbors B acknowledges Neighbors A's friendly and outgoing nature.\n6. Neighbors B has been living in the neighborhood for some time and is supportive of Neighbors A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I totally get that. Our neighborhood really has a way of growing on you. It's great to see how much you've come to appreciate it over time.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly Neighbors A's feelings towards living in the neighborhood (points 1 and 3) which align with Neighbors A's reflection on how the neighborhood has grown on them over the years. However, several other points in the MEMORY (e.g., points 2 and 4) appear contradictory or less relevant to the current context, which limits the overall helpfulness. The MEMORY also includes consistent descriptions of the relationship between Neighbors A and Neighbors B and their interactions (points 5 and 6), which provide a limited context for their conversation. Overall, while the MEMORY provides some useful information, it lacks clear and coherent development of past interactions directly connected to the immediate dialogue."
