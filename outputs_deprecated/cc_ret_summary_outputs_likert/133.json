Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that. Neighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\n2. Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received.\n3. Neighbors B recalls when Neighbors A helped with their lawn, showing mutual support between them.\n4. Neighbors A is detail-oriented and strives for perfection.\n5. Neighbors A and B are helpful towards each other.\n6. Neighbors B values reciprocity and acknowledges the mutual help between them as neighbors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe MEMORY contains information that is relevant and helpful for generating a next response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides insight into the supportive and understanding nature of Neighbors B (sentence 1), which aligns with Neighbors B's response in the dialogue. Additionally, it adds context to their relationship by mentioning past instances of mutual support (sentence 3), which may be beneficial for the model to generate a response that acknowledges this aspect. Sentences about values such as appreciation, gratitude, and reciprocity (sentences 2, 5, 6) can be relevant for steering the conversation positively or reflecting on the dynamics of their relationship.\n\nOverall, MEMORY contains a mix of directly relevant and less relevant but naturally connected information, making it fairly helpful for the task of generating a response in line with the ongoing conversation. However, a more explicit link between the specific upset incident and past interactions could enhance relevance further, thus not reaching the maximum score."
