Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager! Co-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role. Co-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge. Co-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail. Co-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products. Co-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader.\n2. Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\n3. Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader.\n4. Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n5. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n6. Co-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided contains information that is quite relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The dialogue between Co-workers A and B revolves around Co-worker A’s promotion and leadership qualities, which aligns well with some of the details in MEMORY. Specific points in MEMORY, such as Co-worker B's encouragement towards leadership and acknowledgment of Co-worker A's aspirations (sentences 1, 2, and 4), correlate directly with Co-worker A's recent promotion, providing meaningful background to their promotion. Additionally, point 5 about Co-worker A’s growth and increased confidence also supports the conversation about the new responsibilities undertaken. The MEMORY effectively represents the development of past interactions and aspirations between these co-workers with naturally connected sentences. However, some entries, like number 6, while relevant, could be phrased more coherently with the context given. Overall, the MEMORY is quite useful but there is minor room for improvement in linking it even more seamlessly with the context of promotion and current excitement."
