Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on. Child: What is it, Parent? Parent: I created a website where I post advertisements, and people can pay to see them. Child: Oh, that's interesting. How does it work? Parent: Well, I create the ads myself, and then I post them on my website. People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them. Child: Do you think people will pay to see your ads? Parent: I don't know yet, but I hope so. I've put a lot of effort into creating some eye-catching ads. Child: That sounds cool, but why do you want to make money from ads? Parent: Well, I want to have some extra income coming in. Plus, I enjoy being creative and making things, so this is a great way for me to combine those passions. Child: I see. Well, I hope it works out for you, Parent. Parent: Thanks, Child. And who knows, maybe someday you can help me create some ads for the website. Child: Sure, that sounds like fun! Speaking of creativity, remember that time we made those homemade decorations together? Parent: Yes, I do remember that. That was a fun afternoon. Child: It was! Maybe we can do that again someday.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The parent and child have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores.\n2. The Child supports the idea of the Parent adopting more children and hopes for a happy home for them.\n3. The Child is caring and offers help to the Parent.\n4. The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings.\n5. The Parent is working and feels tired after a long day.\n6. The child expresses gratitude for being adopted by the parent and believes other children will be lucky to have them as a parent.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I would love that, Child. Your creativity always inspires me, and I appreciate your willingness to help me with my projects. Let's plan another craft day soon.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided includes information on the relationship dynamics between Parent and Child, such as the child's supportive nature, past conversations about adoption, and the parent's intentions to be a good role model. However, it lacks direct relevance to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on the parent's new website project and their discussion on creativity and making advertisements. While some aspects of the MEMORY may reflect the characters' personalities and relationship, the lack of clear linkage or causality to the dialogue about the website project limits its helpfulness in generating an appropriate next response in the context of the ongoing conversation. Additionally, the sentences in the MEMORY are not naturally connected to each other or the dialogue, making it challenging for a language model to use them effectively."
