Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The student mentioned feeling stressed lately, which may have led to the outburst.\n2. The teacher praised the student for their bravery and quick action in the emergency situation.\n3. The student felt rewarded by the experience and emphasized the importance of being aware of surroundings and acting quickly in emergencies.\n4. The student apologized to the teacher for yelling at them and scaring them in the hallway.\n5. The student once saved a kid from drowning and had a moment of yelling at the teacher in the past.\n6. The student apologizes to the teacher for yelling in the hallway, acknowledging it was out of character and seeking to move past it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provided does not relate directly to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about the student's reaction to hot sauce causing a burning sensation in their mouth. The MEMORY focuses on past interactions involving stress, emergencies, apologies, and yelling, which are unrelated to the current topic of a physical reaction to food. There is no indication of causality or relevance between these memories and the dialogue context, making the MEMORY minimally helpful for generating a relevant response. The sentences in the MEMORY do not provide specific contextual cues needed to understand or build upon the student's statement about hot sauce."
