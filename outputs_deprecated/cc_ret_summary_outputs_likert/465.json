Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess. Classmates B: Wait, what? You cheated on your taxes? That's not okay.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate B reassures Classmate A that they are all in it together and offers help if needed.\n2. Classmate A appreciates the support and understanding from Classmate B.\n3. Classmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed.\n4. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to keep pushing themselves and not let doubts hold them back.\n5. Classmate B brought goods to Classmate A's house and is supportive of their basketball dream.\n6. Classmate A has tried practicing in front of others but still feels nervous.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does not adequately provide helpful information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the MEMORY includes elements of support, encouragement, and goal-setting between Classmate A and Classmate B, it lacks specific relevance to the current context where Classmate A is dealing with the issue of being caught cheating on taxes. The MEMORY primarily focuses on general support related to ambitions and personal development, particularly around basketball, which is not directly useful for addressing the immediate situation discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. There is a limited connection or causality between the events mentioned in the MEMORY and the tax issue, making it less effective in guiding potential responses related to the present conversation."
