Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn. Teacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation? Student: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle. Teacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time? Student: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then. Teacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going? Student: It's going pretty well. I started with French, but now I'm considering taking up Spanish and German too. I want to become more well-rounded. Teacher: That's a great goal. Have you thought about any specific ways you could use your language skills?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The student is studying French at college and plans on learning Spanish and German as well.\n2. The teacher speaks Spanish and French fluently.\n3. The student believes in the importance of continuous learning and growth.\n4. The teacher and student have a positive and understanding relationship.\n5. The teacher advises the student on effective communication and problem-solving, emphasizing the importance of talking calmly and finding solutions together.\n6. The teacher expressed understanding and encouraged the student to seek help when needed.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I was thinking about possibly traveling to different countries where those languages are spoken and immersing myself in the culture. It would be a great way to practice and learn more.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provided includes several useful pieces of information that align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, memory points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are directly relevant to the context. Point 1 reiterates the student's language study plans, which directly link to the conversation about language learning. Point 2 provides additional context about the teacher's linguistic abilities which could inform future dialogue on language learning advice. Point 3 reflects the student's motivation, which could be useful in gauging the student's attitude towards challenges, like learning languages or building spice tolerance. Point 4 offers insight into the overall relationship dynamic between the teacher and student, which can guide the tone of future dialogue. \n\nHowever, points 5 and 6, while naturally phrased, are less directly connected to the specific dialogue context provided (talking about spicy food and language study). They provide general characteristics of the teacher-student relationship but don't directly aid in continuing this specific conversation flow. These points are phrased such that the language model can ignore them easily if they donâ€™t fit into the ongoing dialogue scenario. Overall, the MEMORY serves as helpful context for generating relevant and coherent responses."
