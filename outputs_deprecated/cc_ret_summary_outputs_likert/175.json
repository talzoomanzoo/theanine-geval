Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend! Co-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang. Co-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while. Co-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing? Co-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites. Co-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice. Co-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it. Co-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent. Co-workers A: Thanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it. Co-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have a hobby like that. Reminds me of when you uncovered that mystery a while back. You always seem to surprise us with your skills. Co-workers A: Haha, yeah. I do like a good challenge. Speaking of surprises, remember when I found out you were married? That was a shocker. Co-workers B: Oh gosh, yes. I forget sometimes that not everyone knows. But yeah, I've been married for a few years now. Co-workers A: Crazy how time flies. Like when we found out Ms. Singh was leaving our school. I still can't believe that was two years ago. Co-workers B: I know, right? She was such a great teacher. Speaking of which, have you heard anything about her lately? Co-workers A: Not really. I think she moved to another state, but I'm not sure where.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n2. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together.\n3. Co-worker A is observant and did some research on social media to find out that Co-worker B is married.\n4. Co-worker B is married and had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends.\n5. Co-worker A has a talent for solving puzzles and mysteries.\n6. Co-worker A is described as having \"Sherlock Holmes-like skills\" and enjoys solving mysteries.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, I heard she's teaching at a school in Texas now. It's great to see her continue to inspire students in a new place.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures the surprise Co-worker B felt when Co-worker A found out about their marriage, which is directly mentioned in the conversation. The MEMORY also touches on Co-worker A's interest in solving mysteries, which Co-worker B alludes to when they mention Co-worker A's past achievements in solving a mystery. However, other details like Co-worker B's weekend activities (hiking and dining) and Co-worker A's research on social media are not mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, hence less relevant. The memory sentences are generally well-structured, but not all are directly useful or showing clear development related to the current dialogue context, which is why the score is moderate."
