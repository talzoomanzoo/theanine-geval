Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Child is caring and offers help to the Parent.\n2. The Parent is working and feels tired after a long day.\n3. The parent and child have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores.\n4. The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings.\n5. The Child supports the idea of the Parent adopting more children and hopes for a happy home for them.\n6. The Child offers to bring water or make soup for the Parent while they are resting.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains helpful information that could assist the language model in generating a relevant response. Sentences 1 and 6 show the Child's caring nature and potential willingness to assist the Parent, aligning well with the dialogue context where the Parent shares about a new project. Sentence 2 indicates the Parent's feeling of tiredness, which might influence the Child's response, possibly expressing concern or offering assistance. \n\nSentence 3 adds depth to the relationship between the Parent and Child, highlighting their open communication about diverse topics, which might guide the tone and content of the Child's reply. Sentence 4 reveals the Parent's aspiration to be a better role model, providing context for mutual support that could shape dialogue interactions. Sentence 5, although indirectly related, hints at long-term family goals which might frame shared conversations.\n\nWhile MEMORY generally captures past interactions and could inform subsequent dialogue, the connections between sentences and their relevance to the current context are not particularly strong; hence, it does not fully score a high rating. It's informative, but the continuity in terms of causality and relevancy specifically concerning the new project is not strongly present."
