Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss! Co-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes. Co-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan. Co-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway. Co-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way. Co-workers B: And sometimes it is, but we all have different ideas and perspectives to bring to the table. Co-workers A: Okay, I see your point. I'll try to be more open-minded in the future. Co-workers B: That's all we can ask for. Remember that we're a team and we all have something valuable to contribute. Co-workers A: You're right. I'm glad we can have these conversations and work towards being better together. Co-workers B: Me too. Speaking of working together, do you remember when you gave me back my watch a few months ago? That meant a lot to me. Co-workers A: Of course I remember! I'm happy we're friends again. Co-workers B: Me too. And do you still have that baby doll and rattle you bought a couple of years ago?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.\n2. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B enjoy taking moments to connect with each other and find these moments make work more enjoyable.\n3. Co-worker A returned a watch to Co-worker B, making them happy again.\n4. Co-worker A and Co-worker B had a disagreement but resolved it, becoming friends again.\n5. Co-worker A has a history of helping out Co-worker B and values their friendship.\n6. Co-worker A returned Co-worker B's watch a few years ago, leading to the rekindling of their friendship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I still have them! I'm glad those small gestures meant something to you. It's nice to look back on those memories.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided is highly aligned and relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures the significant interactions and relationship dynamics between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, offering helpful context and continuity. The memory sections such as 3 (\"Co-worker A returned a watch to Co-worker B, making happy again\") and 6 (\"Co-worker A returned Co-worker B's watch a few years ago, leading to the rekindling of their friendship\") directly reference Co-worker B's mention of the watch in the dialogue. Sub-memory 4 provides context to their past disagreement and resolution that mirrors the sentiment in the conversation where they discuss the importance of different perspectives and working as a team. Each point in the memory is well-structured, indicating past interactions, development of friendship, and moments of understanding between the characters that a language model can effectively utilize to generate meaningful continuations of the conversation."
