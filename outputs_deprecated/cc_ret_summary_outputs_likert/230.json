Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I can't believe how honored I am to be part of our class. I feel like we have something special going on here. Classmates B:  You're right. Our class definitely has a unique energy about it. What do you think sets us apart from other classes? Classmates A:  I think it's our sense of community. We all support each other and work together to achieve our goals. Classmates B:  That's definitely a big factor. And I also think our class has a lot of diversity, which brings new perspectives and ideas to the table. Classmates A:  Yes, absolutely. I love hearing everyone's different viewpoints and experiences. It really helps us all grow and learn.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B complimented Classmates A on their suit and brought up a past conversation about feelings.\n2. Classmates B appreciates Classmates A's honesty about their feelings, but doesn't feel the same way.\n3. Classmate B feels relieved that they can still be friends with Classmate A.\n4. Classmates A values their friendship with Classmates B and looks forward to wearing a black suit to a wedding reception.\n5. Despite the rejection, Classmate A values their friendship with Classmate B.\n6. Classmate A has been hiding their feelings for Classmate B and finally confesses to being in love with them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I completely agree. It's so refreshing to be surrounded by such a dynamic group of individuals. I'm grateful to have you as a friend in this class.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains details about past interactions between Classmates A and B, specifically related to emotional exchanges and feelings, which do not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The current dialogue context is focused on the energy, sense of community, and diversity within their class, rather than personal feelings or a potential romantic interest. While the MEMORY provides a narrative of a meaningful interaction in terms of emotional honesty, it lacks relevance to the primary discussion of class dynamics and unity happening in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORIES about feelings, honesty, and friendship could in theory add a rich personal layer to a conversation, but they don't add immediate value or direction to the conversation about class characteristics. Therefore, while the MEMORY is structured naturally and tells a connected story, it doesn't offer helpful information for progressing the given dialogue in a relevant manner."
