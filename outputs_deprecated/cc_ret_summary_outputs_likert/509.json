Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. Neighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. Neighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off. Neighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks? Neighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly.\n2. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n3. Neighbor B reminds Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them.\n4. Neighbor A started construction on the house last week and plans to finish it in record time.\n5. Neighbor A has skills in manipulation and getting what they want.\n6. Neighbors A helped Neighbors B build a new house with amazing features.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Maybe try setting a timer for each task to keep yourself on track. You have the skills to get things done efficiently, just like when you helped me build that amazing house.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information about Neighbor A's skills and past interactions with Neighbor B, which could potentially be helpful in terms of understanding Neighbor A's ability to complete tasks quickly, as seen in points 1, 3, 4, and 6. However, the MEMORY largely focuses on construction-related achievements and manipulative skills, which do not directly address the issue of procrastination mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The connections between these memories and the current conversation about procrastination are not strongly relevant or clear, making it moderately helpful at best. The MEMORY does not offer significant insights into Neighbor A's challenges in maintaining focus or strategies to overcome procrastination. Overall, while some sentences hint at Neighbor A's capabilities, there is insufficient direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT to merit a higher score."
