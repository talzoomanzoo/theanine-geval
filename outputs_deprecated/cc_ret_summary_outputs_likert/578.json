    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become? Neighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out? Neighbors A: Yes, I go to the gym every day and lift weights. It's been really helping me build muscle.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors B offers help and support to Neighbors A in the situation.\n2. Neighbors B appreciates Neighbors A's handy skills.\n3. Neighbor A noticed some wood near their backyard and asked Neighbor B if they had seen it too.\n4. Neighbor A values their friendship with Neighbor B and wants to ensure it remains strong.\n5. Neighbors A and B discuss the possibility of someone in the neighborhood using the wood for a project.\n6. Neighbors A and B are observing wood that appears to be freshly cut from a tree.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! Your hard work is definitely paying off. If you ever need a spotter or someone to work out with, just let me know.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY does not provide direct information that would be helpful in generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Most of the MEMORY is focused on a separate scenario involving the two neighbors and some wood, rather than the conversation about physical strength and working out. The connection between the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is minimal at best, indicating past interactions between the neighbors but not in the area relevant to the context given. Sentences are somewhat structured, which could help identify certain past interactions, but they lack clear relevance to the current topic of conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY does hint at a friendly relationship between the two neighbors which could indirectly inform tone or response style slightly, hence the score of 2 rather than a 1."
