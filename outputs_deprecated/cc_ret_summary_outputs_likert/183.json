Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today. Wife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that. Husband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you. Wife: You always go above and beyond, dear. Husband: It's the little things that count, right?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful.\n2. The husband appreciates the little things in life, such as making it to the bus on time.\n3. The husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that make him happy outside of work and family life.\n4. The wife is glad to see the husband finding a sense of purpose and being happy.\n5. Husband values the supportive community of believers at church and appreciates having his wife by his side.\n6. The husband values spending time with his friend, feeling happy and content with their company.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly the sentiment that \"it's the little things that count,\" which directly ties to the dialogue between the husband and wife. However, other parts of the  MEMORY, such as references to the husband's appreciation for catching the bus on time or his supportive church community, are not directly relevant to the current dialogue context focused on creating a warm and cozy home environment. These points could still provide a broader understanding of the husband's values and interactions but are not immediately helpful for generating the next response based on the given dialogue. The sentences in the MEMORY are naturally phrased, but there could be more clear connections or developments regarding the couple's interactions about the home setting to merit a higher score."
