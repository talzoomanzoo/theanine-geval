Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing! Neighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and B both took a cooking class together last year.\n2. Neighbors A and B believe in doing nice things for others to bring the community together.\n3. Neighbors A saw George at the store and exchanged waves.\n4. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's organization skills and wishes to improve their own organization.\n5. Neighbors B remembers the incident.\n6. Both Neighbors A and B believe in the importance of learning and self-improvement.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some information about Neighbors A and B, but it does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Neighbors A's recent trip to South America or encourage a conversation in that direction. The memories are a collection of facts about the neighbors' past interactions, interests, and perceptions of each other but lack relevance to the current discussion.\n\nSpecifically:\n- Sentence 1, about a cooking class, does not connect to the travel conversation.\n- Sentence 2, about bringing the community together, and Sentence 6, about self-improvement, could be seen as indirectly relevant if applied to travel experiences, but they are not clearly connected to the trip conversation.\n- Sentences 3, 4, and 5 do not add any relevant context or causality to the dialogue about traveling.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY is composed of naturally structured sentences giving a glimpse into the neighbors' lives, it does not offer helpful cues or development relevant to generating a response related to the conversation at hand. A score of 2 reflects its limited utility in shaping the dialogue based on the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
