Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today. Classmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about? Classmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held. Classmates B: Wow, that does sound interesting. Did you take any notes? Classmates A: Yes, I took lots of notes. I'm excited to study this topic more on my own time. Classmates B: That's awesome. It's great to see your enthusiasm for learning. Classmates A: Thanks. I've always been passionate about learning new things. Remember when we talked about how determined I was to get into college? Classmates B: Yeah, I remember. You were always studying and taking extra classes.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A is dedicated to studying hard and taking extra classes to get into a good college.\n2. Classmates B noticed Classmates A's improvement and acknowledged their hard work.\n3. Classmates A had a moment of frustration in the past but has learned to channel that energy into studies.\n4. Classmates A struggled with motivation but found a way to stay focused by thinking about the payoff of their hard work.\n5. Classmates A is willing to work hard to achieve their dreams.\n6. Classmates A's grades are looking good according to their teacher.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information regarding Classmates A's determination and dedication to their studies, which is relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about their enthusiasm for learning. The MEMORY contains sentences (e.g., 1 and 4) that align with Classmates A's past interactions and their emphasis on studying hard to achieve their dreams, which can aid Unknown in generating a coherent next response. However, the MEMORY could be improved by including more specific details or direct references to shared past events between Classmates A and B, increasing the interconnectedness and clarity of past interactions. The additional information on Classmates A's struggle and progress (e.g., 2, 3, and 6) adds context but is not directly linked to the current dialogue context, limiting its immediate utility for generating a response."
