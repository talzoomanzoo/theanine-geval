Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something. Classmates B: Sure, what's on your mind? Classmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you. Classmates B: Oh, really? Classmates A: Yes, really. I know we've been friends for a while now, but I feel like there may be something more between us.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B are close and have a level of trust between them.\n2. Classmates A tends to overthink things and appreciated Classmates B's support and advice.\n3. Classmates A discovered a secret that Classmates B has been keeping.\n4. Classmates A and B are students in the same class.\n5. Classmates A and B have had a previous positive interaction in a coffee shop where Classmates A rubbed Classmates B's neck, providing relaxation.\n6. Classmates A had doubts about trusting Classmates B due to rumors about their reliability.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful insights for the language model to generate a proper response in the ongoing dialogue. It highlights key aspects of the relationship between Classmates A and B that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically:\n\n1. The MEMORY includes information about Classmates A and B being close and having a level of trust (Memory item 1), which aligns with Classmates A expressing deeper feelings in the dialogue context.\n\n2. Classmates A's tendency to overthink (Memory item 2) connects to their prolonged contemplation over their feelings, as mentioned in the dialogue context.\n\n3. The past positive interaction in a coffee shop where Classmates A comforted Classmates B (Memory item 5) adds context to the relationship's depth and possibly shared intimacy, supporting the notion of 'something more' mentioned by Classmates A.\n\nHowever, a couple of items (Memory items 3 and 6) are not intrinsically connected to the main dialogue context and may detract slightly from its helpfulness, indicating some areas of ambiguity or contrasting previous experiences that were not addressed in the current dialogue.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is largely structured in a way that supports the language model in understanding the past interactions and relationship dynamics between Classmates A and B, thus receiving a high score."
