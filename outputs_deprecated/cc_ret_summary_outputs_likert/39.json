    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly. Neighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit? Neighbors A: It was Chicago. I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations. Neighbors B: I bet it was a nice change of scenery from our neighborhood. Neighbors A: Definitely. But you know, it's interesting how much our neighborhood has grown on me over the years. I remember when I first moved here, I was so unsure about it. Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember. But you stayed because you wanted to be here.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A enjoys living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbor A has been living in the same place for a long time and enjoys the neighborhood and people there.\n3. Neighbors A is excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends.\n4. Neighbors B has been living in the neighborhood for some time and is supportive of Neighbors A.\n5. Neighbors A just moved to a new neighborhood and is getting to know the area.\n6. Neighbor B has moved around a lot over the years but is considering settling down in the current neighborhood.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's true. I'm really glad I decided to stay. It's amazing how much this neighborhood has become like home to me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY includes some information about the experience and thoughts of both Neighbors A and B regarding their neighborhood. Most sentences seem to provide general background details about Neighbors A liking the neighborhood, having good friends, and feeling comfortable, which slightly connects to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Neighbor A reflects on how the neighborhood has grown on them. However, there are inconsistencies and irrelevant parts in the MEMORY that reduce its helpfulness score. For example, sentence 5 contradicts the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as Neighbor A is not depicted as someone who just moved in. Moreover, the details about Neighbor B moving around a lot (sentence 6) doesn't provide helpful context in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT at hand. Although there is some relevant information, the lack of contextual clarity and contradiction muddles its usefulness for generating a coherent and contextually appropriate response next."
