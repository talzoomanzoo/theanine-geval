Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both neighbors emphasize the importance of taking care of each other as neighbors.\n2. Neighbors A offers to help Neighbors B with getting into a workout routine.\n3. Neighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B.\n4. Neighbors B offers to be more supportive and check in on Neighbors A more often.\n5. Neighbors A believes in setting goals, developing a positive attitude, and taking action for personal development and career advancement.\n6. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's career advancement and expresses interest in borrowing the personal development book.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a great idea! It's always good to have clear boundaries. Thank you for being proactive about it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided offers some insights into the relationship between Neighbors A and B, detailing a supportive and collaborative dynamic. However, these details do not directly connect to or enhance the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which involves marking a boundary line on a shared property wall. The information about taking care of each other, helping with workouts, or sharing books, while they suggest a friendly relationship, do not assist in generating a relevant response to the specific boundary line discussion. Essentially, most sentences in MEMORY do not seem to offer helpful information for a language model to generate a relevant response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
