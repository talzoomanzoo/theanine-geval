Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become? Neighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out? Neighbors A: Yes, I go to the gym every day and lift weights. It's been really helping me build muscle. Neighbors B: That's great to hear! It reminds me of the time when you apologized to me for the way you treated me. Neighbors A: Yes, I realized that I needed to take responsibility for my actions and I didn't want to make the same mistake again.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A apologized to Neighbors B for their behavior and admitted to being wrong.\n2. Neighbors B reminds Neighbors A about taking responsibility for their mistakes in the past and learning from them.\n3. Neighbor A apologized to Neighbor B for their behavior and expressed a desire to make amends.\n4. Neighbor B accepted Neighbor A's apology and mentioned that it was hurtful to be treated that way.\n5. Neighbors B offers help and support to Neighbors A in the situation.\n6. Neighbors A and B were able to resolve their issues and maintain a friendly relationship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate your willingness to learn from your mistakes and make amends. It really means a lot to me. If you ever need any help or support in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several relevant details about the past interactions between Neighbors A and B, specifically focusing on the apology and reconciliation process. Sentences 1, 2, 3, and 4 are particularly relevant because they directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where the topic of the previous apology was brought up. These sentences are clearly structured to demonstrate the causality and development of their relationship, such as how Neighbors A apologized and Neighbors B's response. Sentence 6 helps establish the outcome of their interactions, showing that they resolved their issues and maintained a friendly relationship, which provides context for their current conversation. Sentence 5 is not directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but is still naturally phrased and contributes to understanding their supportive relationship. Overall, the MEMORY supplies useful information with clear connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, supporting the generation of a cohesive next response."
