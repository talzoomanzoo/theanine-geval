    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now! Neighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen? Neighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest. Neighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations! What are you going to do with all that money? Neighbors A: Well, first I'm going to pay off my mortgage and all my debts. After that, I think I'll take a nice long vacation and maybe donate some to charity. Neighbors B: That's very generous of you. Have you thought about investing any of it? Neighbors A: Yes, actually. I've been doing some research and I think I want to invest in some stocks and maybe even start my own business. Neighbors B: That sounds like a great idea. You have the opportunity to do so much with your newfound wealth. Neighbors A: Definitely. It's funny how things can change so quickly. Just a few years ago, I was stuck in a job I hated and now I have all this freedom. Neighbors B: Speaking of jobs, have you thought about what you want to do now? You don't really have to work if you don't want to.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A made a big career change recently and is much happier now.\n2. Neighbors A took the leap to make a change and is glad they did.\n3. Neighbors A is feeling stagnant in their current job and is looking for more growth and challenge.\n4. Neighbors B has been supportive of Neighbors A's job search, offering to connect them with people in different industries.\n5. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's decision and admires the courage it took.\n6. Neighbors A and B had a conversation a couple of years ago about needing a change.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've actually been thinking about that a lot. I've always loved helping people and making a difference, so I'm considering starting a non-profit organization to focus on causes that are important to me. It's something I've always dreamed of doing, and now I have the means to make it a reality.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly the elements about Neighbors A considering changes in their career and having support from Neighbors B. For instance, sentence 6 refers to a conversation a couple of years ago about needing a change, which ties into Neighbors A's recent windfall and the discussion of newfound freedom and job decisions. However, the MEMORY does not specifically mention the inheritance or the financial aspect of the conversation, which is central to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY hints at past discussions about career changes (e.g., sentence 1 and sentence 2) but doesn't fully explain the recent development of inheritance and financial freedom directly. Therefore, while some connections can be inferred, the information does not provide as clear or as relevant a context as it could."
