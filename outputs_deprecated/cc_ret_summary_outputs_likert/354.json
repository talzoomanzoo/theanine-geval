Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me. Co-workers B: That's amazing to hear. Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job. Co-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work. Co-workers B: It's great to have that kind of positive reinforcement. Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated? Co-workers A: Oh yeah, I remember. I was so angry after blowing up that rabbit with the dynamite. But talking it out with you really helped me work through my emotions. Co-workers B: That's right. It's important to have someone to talk to when you're feeling overwhelmed or upset. Co-workers A: And speaking of talking it out, do you remember when I was a kid and I ran to our parents screaming because of that spider? Co-workers B: Ha, yes I do! It's funny to think about now, but phobias are no laughing matter. Co-workers A: Absolutely. And on a lighter note, I made a pair of wire earrings the other day. It was so much fun to create something beautiful with my own hands.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A has overcome fears and anxieties to create beautiful earrings.\n2. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.\n3. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to try relaxation techniques or find a hobby to de-stress and overcome fears.\n4. Co-worker B acknowledges that some people have fears and suggests finding healthy ways to deal with frustrations.\n5. Co-worker A and Co-worker B met on a movie set and are now good friends.\n6. Co-worker A is creative and talented in making jewelry.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fantastic! I'm so proud of you for pushing past your fears and creating something so beautiful. Your talent really shines through in your jewelry making.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains several relevant connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The information within MEMORY regarding Co-worker A overcoming fears and anxieties (Point 1) coheres well with the dialogue's theme of emotional support and shared experiences overcoming challenges. Also, MEMORY points about their collaboration bringing out the best in each other (Point 2) and Co-worker B acknowledging and suggesting finding healthy ways to deal with fears (Point 4) align with the topics discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Furthermore, the note that Co-worker A is creative and talented in making jewelry (Point 6) establishes a connection to A's recent mention of creating wire earrings. The MEMORY phrases are well-structured and convey clear meanings of past interactions and potential support strategies that might be useful in generating a proper response to the ongoing dialogue context. However, some points like meeting on a movie set (Point 5) are not directly related to the immediate topics within the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and add limited value, preventing a perfect score."
