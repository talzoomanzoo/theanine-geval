    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, check out this spot I found to camp out for the night. It's perfect! Classmates B: Wow, this view is amazing! Classmates A: I know, right? And it's completely level and free of any debris. We won't have to worry about rolling off our sleeping pads or anything like that. Classmates B: It definitely looks like a great spot to spend the night. How did you manage to find it? Classmates A: Just a stroke of luck, I guess. I was exploring the area and stumbled upon it. It's always good to be a little adventurous and explore new places, you never know what you might find. Classmates B: That's true. You always seem to find the best spots. Like that time we went camping near the lake and had the whole place to ourselves.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate A expresses a desire to find alternative ways to have fun and make a positive impact in the community.\n2. Classmates B finds Classmates A's involvement in the community admirable and important.\n3. Classmates A is proactive and curious, taking the initiative to research topics of interest.\n4. Classmates B remembers Classmates A's previous involvement in community improvement projects and acknowledges their passion for making a difference.\n5. Classmate A and Classmate B are classmates who attended a party together.\n6. Classmate B agrees to keep the party a secret in exchange for Classmate A doing their homework for a week.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, that was such a memorable trip. I'm glad we got to experience that together. It's moments like that where I feel truly connected to nature and appreciate the beauty around us.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some background information about Classmates A and B, highlighting traits such as Classmate A's desire to explore and make a community impact, paralleling their adventurous nature in exploring camping spots as seen in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, most information in MEMORY is not directly relevant or beneficial to generating a next response based on the camping scenario described in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While traits like being proactive and curious can slightly relate to finding a great camping spot, the information about attending a party and homework exchange is not relevant to the present dialogue context and appears disconnected. Consequently, the majority of the MEMORY does not significantly contribute to continuing the camping conversation adequately."
