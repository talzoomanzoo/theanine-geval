Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager! Co-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role. Co-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader.\n2. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n3. Co-worker B acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress.\n4. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader.\n5. Co-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication.\n6. Co-worker A is feeling stressed about their relationship with Co-worker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's completely normal to feel that way, but I have full confidence in your abilities. You've come a long way and I know you'll do great as a product manager. If you ever need help or support, I'm here for you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe memory provides a fair amount of helpful information regarding Co-worker A's ambition and readiness to take on a leadership role, which aligns with their promotion to product manager mentioned in the dialogue context. This connection is reflected in several sentences, such as 1, 2, 4, and 5. Sentence 3 indicates Co-worker B's supportive role, which is relevant as it matches the congratulatory response in the dialogue. However, sentence 6, about Co-worker A feeling stressed about their relationship, seems disconnected from the ongoing professional context. Overall, while the relevant sentences are helpful and naturally structured, the presence of less relevant information like sentence 6 without explicit contextual linkage reduces the overall helpfulness of the memory."
