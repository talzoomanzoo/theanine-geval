Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend! Co-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang. Co-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while. Co-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing? Co-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites. Co-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice. Co-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it. Co-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent. Co-workers A: Thanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it. Co-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have a hobby like that. Reminds me of when you uncovered that mystery a while back. You always seem to surprise us with your skills. Co-workers A: Haha, yeah. I do like a good challenge. Speaking of surprises, remember when I found out you were married? That was a shocker. Co-workers B: Oh gosh, yes. I forget sometimes that not everyone knows. But yeah, I've been married for a few years now. Co-workers A: Crazy how time flies. Like when we found out Ms. Singh was leaving our school. I still can't believe that was two years ago. Co-workers B: I know, right? She was such a great teacher. Speaking of which, have you heard anything about her lately? Co-workers A: Not really. I think she moved to another state, but I'm not sure where. Co-workers B: Ah, okay. Well, hopefully she's doing well wherever she is. But hey, getting back to your solo, I think you should definitely do it again sometime. Co-workers A: Really? You think so? Co-workers B: Absolutely. You've got a gift, and it would be a shame not to use it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together.\n2. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n3. Co-worker A has a talent for solving puzzles and mysteries.\n4. Co-worker A is described as having \"Sherlock Holmes-like skills\" and enjoys solving mysteries.\n5. Co-worker B is married and had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends.\n6. Co-worker A suggests celebrating their detective work with drinks after work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided contains some elements that are helpful for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. There are relevant pieces of information, such as Co-worker A's talent for solving mysteries and puzzles, and Co-worker B's marital status, which are consistent with the context where Co-worker B recalls when A discovered B was married. Additionally, the MEMORY captures the general positive interactions and shared experiences, which mirror their friendly exchange in the context. However, some details, such as Co-worker B's weekend activities (hiking and dinner with friends) and the suggestion for drinks to celebrate detective work, are not directly relevant to the given context, leading to a lower score. Overall, the MEMORY gives a sense of their past interactions, but not all sentences are connected to or enhance the dialogue context."
