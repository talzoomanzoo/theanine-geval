Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Unknown, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together. Neighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left? Neighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbor A appreciates the emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during their time of grief.\n2. Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.\n3. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n4. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have a close friendship and have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n5. Neighbor A's old apartment building was not the best place to live in.\n6. Neighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not entirely focused on the immediate context. The MEMORY includes aspects of Neighbor A's emotional state and the supportive role of Neighbor B (points 1 and 3), which align with the current conversation about emotional distress and seeking support. These points demonstrate the connection and support between the two characters, which could inform and shape Neighbor B's responses.\n\nHowever, some points in the MEMORY, such as the details about the loss of the grandmother, shared memories in the park, and moving to a new neighborhood (points 2, 4, and 6), while informative about past interactions, do not directly enhance or clarify the immediate context of the conversation about Neighbor A's romantic issues. Although these points are naturally phrased and provide some background, their relevance to the current situation is limited.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY contains helpful elements, but it is not fully optimized for the specific context of Neighbor A's relationship troubles. The causality, connection, and relevancy are somewhat demonstrated, warranting a score of 3."
