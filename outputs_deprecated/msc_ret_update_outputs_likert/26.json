Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting! Speaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow? Speaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from. Speaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same. Speaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n2. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n4. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n5. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n6. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's totally understandable. It's always good to be cautious and informed about what we're consuming. Plant-based options are a great alternative, and it's always fun to try new things. Maybe one day you can try my chili dog casserole too, it's a unique dish that might surprise you!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that could be useful for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, point 5, which indicates that Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology, and point 6, showing that Speaker B works at a research lab, providing useful context for Speaker Bâ€™s interest in lab work and the cloning project mentioned in the dialogue. These points are related to Speaker B's academic and professional interests, which align with the discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about working in a lab and the cloning of a cow.\n\nHowever, the rest of the MEMORY does not directly relate to the ongoing conversation. For example, point 1 discusses Speaker A's plan to visit a diner and try hamburgers made by Speaker B, which is not directly relevant. Point 2 refers to a chili dog casserole Speaker B invented, and point 4 mentions what Speaker B had for dinner, neither of which are pertinent to the topics discussed in the CONTEXT. \n\nOverall, while there are some helpful elements, the MEMORY could be more focused and cohesive in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
