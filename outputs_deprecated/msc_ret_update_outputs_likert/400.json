Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes.  Speaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me. Speaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house.  Speaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it.  Speaker A: That is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks? Speaker B: The only trick I was able to teach him, that I deeply regret, was how locks worked. I thought it was cool at first, you know, to see a raccoon unlock a door. And now, I regret it so much. I've had to change the layout of my apartment and put deadbolts on my doors so that Bandicoot can't get out. And, he is sneaky about it. One time, he unlocked the pantry and was eating some cookies! It's like having a toddler that never grows up. Speaker A: That is bad I guess.  Do you keep all of your chemicals, poisons, and medications up and locked?  I would hate to think what might happen if Bandicoot got into any of that.  Hey, when you drive do you lock him up in a cage or let him wander around in the car?  That could be dangerous for you driving and he freaks out. Speaker B: All the chemicals and poisons are in a gated lock in the basement. The lock requires a specific key, which I have hidden in my drawers. For medication, I have a small box that I also keep locked up, but it's a combination lock, so Bandicoot isn't able to get into it. For driving, I bought a harness that keeps him strapped in the back seat, he can move a bit, but mostly sturdy. I put blankets down and his favorite toys so that he stays calm. Sometimes, I'll pass small snacks to keep him occupied. I also take the side streets to work so that it's not too much for him. What about you? When you foster dogs, do you put them in a cage when you drive? Speaker A: I do keep the dogs secured. You never knwo how they are going to react.  Most of them I only have for a few days, so I really do not get a chance to see how they will act in all situations.   Speaker B: Oh, does that make you want to adopt a dog? I know you said it makes you sad to see them come and go, so why not adopt one? Speaker A: It easer to foster them right now.  If I go out of town for a few days and I had my own dog, I might not be able to take it with me.  So the foster stuff is best.  I can take in a dog for only the time I can spend a lot of time with it.  I think this is best for the dog.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n2. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n3. Speaker B has a dog named Bandicoot and is willing to bring him over for extra company.\n4. Speaker A fosters dogs and is used to them coming and going.\n5. Speaker A fosters dogs till they find a forever home.\n6. Bandicoot was a rescue and has been at the Raccoon Cafe since he was a baby.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That makes sense. Fostering definitely allows you to provide temporary care and attention to dogs in need without the long-term commitment. It's wonderful that you're able to help them during the time you can dedicate to each one. Keep up the great work!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains pieces of information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks full coherence and accuracy in terms of focusing on the specific details from the conversation. Here is the analysis:\n\n1. Some aspects of the MEMORY are relevant, such as Speaker B's involvement with raccoons and Speaker A's fostering of dogs. Specifically, MEMORY point 1 mentions Speaker B's interest in training a raccoon, which aligns with the dialogue about teaching Bandicoot tricks.\n\n2. MEMORY point 2 provides Speaker B's belief that raccoons can be good pets, which reflects part of the conversation about Bandicoot's behavior and living circumstances.\n\n3. MEMORY points 4 and 5 capture Speaker A's fostering of dogs, including the aspect of seeing them come and go, which relates to the conversation about transportation and fostering.\n\n4. However, there are some inaccuracies: MEMORY point 3 incorrectly states that Bandicoot is a dog, whereas he is a raccoon. Additionally, MEMORY point 6 inaccurately portrays the context of Bandicoot's rescue and current habitat, as the dialogue mentions that Speaker B got Bandicoot through animal control and that Bandicoot is currently living with Speaker B.\n\n5. While these points provide some helpful insights into past interactions, not all align closely with the context or are useful for the language model’s generation of a proper next response in this context. The inaccuracies in the memory points diminish its usefulness.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides some useful contextual grounding for a language model, but inaccuracies and some off-relevance points reduce its effectiveness."
