Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice.  Speaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with? Speaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think? Speaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n2. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n3. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n4. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n5. Speaker A has given a pressure cooker as a gift and uses it for recipes like lamb shanks.\n6. Speaker B's husband is a great cook and Speaker B is not skilled in cooking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, shrimp fried rice typically includes eggs, so it's a fantastic recipe to incorporate your homegrown eggs. It's a delicious and satisfying dish that's relatively easy to make in a pressure cooker. Let me know if you need any tips or guidance when you're ready to give it a try!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of helpful information that relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and can aid in generating a more informed response. The key points from the MEMORY, such as Speaker B's husband being an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food (point 1), and Speaker B's interest in learning to cook with a pressure cooker (point 2) are relevant to the dialogue as they align with the discussion on trying new recipes, particularly Asian ones. \n\nAdditionally, the MEMORY's mention of Speaker A being experienced with pressure cooking (points 3 and 4) offers background that supports their recommendation of recipes and pressure cooker use to Speaker B. The context of recommending the shrimp fried rice recipe seems consistent with Speaker B wanting to try something new that incorporates ingredients available to them, such as eggs from their own supply.\n\nThe MEMORY, however, does have some redundant information, like reaffirming that Speaker B's husband is a great cook (point 6), which is already captured in point 1. It could be better organized for clarity and concise relevance, but overall it is informative and structured well enough to be helpful. It's clear, coherent, and offers continuity to the interaction in the dialogue context."
