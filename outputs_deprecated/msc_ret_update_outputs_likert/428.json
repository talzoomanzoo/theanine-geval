Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha! Speaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes? Speaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe.  Speaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm?  Speaker B: I'll be living off campus, so absolutely. How about you? Are you staying in the dorms?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n3. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n4. Speaker B goes to Hawaii for scuba diving and is considering studying marine life or a different type of animal.\n5. Speaker B has an interest in diving and is planning to take neuroscience classes using the GI Bill.\n6. Speaker A is interested in scuba diving and neuroscience, with experience in a research lab.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I agree, snakes are truly fascinating creatures! And that's great that you'll be able to bring them with you. I'll actually be staying off campus as well, so no dorm life for me either. It's nice to have a bit more freedom and space.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, the details about Speaker B having two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel (line 1) are directly relevant, as the conversation begins with Speaker A asking about Speaker B's pet snakes. Additionally, MEMORY introduces additional background about Speaker B's interests (lines 4-5) which could be potentially interesting if the dialogue shifts towards Speaker B's hobbies and future plans. However, parts of the MEMORY, such as Speaker A's plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies (line 3) or both speakers' general interest in neuroscience and scuba diving (lines 5-6), are not directly connected to the immediate conversation context about Speaker B's snakes and housing plans for college. These latter details are not structured in a way that shows development or causality between past interactions specific to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore the MEMORY gets a middle score, reflecting its partial but not full relevance and helpfulness."
