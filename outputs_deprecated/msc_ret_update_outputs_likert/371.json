Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? Speaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month Speaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation? Speaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n2. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n3. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo.\n5. Speaker A enjoys seeing pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister.\n6. Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a fantastic trip! San Diego Zoo is amazing. You'll have a great time exploring all the different exhibits and animals there. Make sure to visit the pandas and penguins while you're there, they're always a delight to see!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that can aid in generating a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 2 is directly connected to the Context as it mentions Speaker B's consideration of adopting a kitten, which is a part of the ongoing conversation. Sentence 4 speaks about Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo, which correlates with their excitement about visiting the zoo in San Diego. However, other sentences, such as information about Speaker A's preferences for pandas, penguins, and cockatoos or their hobbies, don't directly contribute to the specific flow of the current dialogue. The sentences are naturally structured, helping to delineate the interests of both speakers, yet more direct relevance to the immediate topic could enhance the score."
