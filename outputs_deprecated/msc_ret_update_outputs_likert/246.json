Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me. Speaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway? Speaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible. Speaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most? Speaker A: I like to go hiking in the local trails here. I am familiar with them and there's so many routes that I can take. Sadly, the bugs are as bad here as they are anywhere else.....\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n2. Speaker B dislikes bugs and is not a fan of camping, hiking, or the outdoors.\n3. Speaker A is nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes.\n4. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy being outdoors, but Speaker B prefers the fresh air over being in the mud and rain.\n6. Speaker A leads hikes for the group they camp with, which are usually an hour or two long.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Maybe I'll consider joining you on one of your shorter hikes one day. It sounds like you make it a fun experience with all those snacks and drinks.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some potentially relevant information, but overall, it does not align well with the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT or does not fully support generating a relevant response. Several sentences in the memory seem either contradictory or not fully connected with the context. For instance, the MEMORY states \"Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it,\" which contradicts Speaker B's statement in the dialogue suggesting they are not a fan of the outdoors, hiking, or when bugs are out. Additionally, other points in the MEMORY like plans for the Appalachian Trail or details on camping trips are not mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making them less clearly relevant. The only aspect that aligns well is Speaker B's dislike for bugs and the outdoors, but this information is already evident in the dialogue. Thus, while the MEMORY contains some potentially useful information, it lacks cohesion and clear connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT to be of significant help."
