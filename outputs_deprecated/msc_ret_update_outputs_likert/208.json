Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships! Speaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n2. Speaker B is looking for internships in the sports medicine field and has asked professors for letters of recommendation.\n3. Speaker A suggests that surfing could be a way for Speaker B to make connections in the medical field.\n4. Speaker B is studying sports medicine and plays soccer, looking to join their college team in the future.\n5. Speaker B is interested in sports medicine and enjoys surfing.\n6. Speaker B's professors have been supportive in writing letters for an internship application.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm a nurse, so I have some connections in the medical field that might be helpful for you. Have you tried reaching out to any sports medicine clinics or local sports teams for internship opportunities? It could be a great way to combine your passion for sports and medicine!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for Speaker A to generate a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes Speaker B's interest in sports medicine, their ongoing search for internships, and interactions with professors for recommendations, aligning well with the context of discussing internships and work in the medical field. The details about Speaker B's involvement in sports medicine and related activities like soccer and surfing are relevant and could be referenced in the response. While some parts of the MEMORY (e.g., surfing suggestion) are less directly connected, the sentences are naturally phrased and help outline the development of prior interactions, making it easy for the language model to identify the relevant context."
