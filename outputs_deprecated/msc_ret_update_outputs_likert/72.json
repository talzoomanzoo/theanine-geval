Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music. Speaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band? Speaker B: I'm big fan of aerosmith. When do you learn music. Whom teach you? Speaker A: aerosmith are great, have you ever seen them live? I have been playing drums since i was a kid, my father taught me when I was young and from then on I just taught myself Speaker B: That's awesome! I have been trying to learn last one year. Still I didn't get right teacher. I'm jealous on you. I don't have like your dad. Speaker A: what instrument have you been trying to learn?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician.\n2. Speaker B is willing to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook.\n3. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend.\n4. Speaker A wants to see Sublime live one day but doesn't go to many concerts other than the ones their band plays in.\n5. Speaker A is part of a band that tours different countries for their music.\n6. Speaker B wishes they had time to go surfing and is considering getting lessons at a surf shop.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it could be improved for relevance and coherence. \n\n- Sentence 1 mentions that Speaker A is in a band and plays music, which aligns with the context where Speaker A discusses playing drums. This is relevant.\n- Sentence 3 emphasizes Speaker A's involvement in a band as a drummer, again aligning with the context. This can help in crafting a more informed response about Speaker A's music background.\n- Sentence 5 indicates that Speaker A's band tours internationally, which can be relevant if the conversation shifts to discussing performances or experiences abroad.\n- Other sentences, such as 2 and 6, are unrelated to the current conversation about music and could confuse the language model if not clearly identified as extraneous.\n\nWhile some sentences are useful in understanding the music-related background of Speaker A, others are unrelated and may not clearly support generating the next response based on the ongoing conversation. Sentences should be better connected to the context to achieve a higher helpfulness score."
