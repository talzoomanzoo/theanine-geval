Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods. Speaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about? Speaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America. Have you seen any of those movies? Speaker B: No I haven't seen any of those. What foods did you eat while watching the movie? Speaker A: Wow, there are so many of the movies out there. Don't go see Black Widow without watching Avengers first. I had an amazing steak and vegetables on the side that were delicious. What is you favorite food?  Speaker B: Oh ok I definitely will watch those first! I love both steak and vegetables! I am a real foodie and love just about everything that isn't too strange to try lol.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and their brother enjoy going to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner.\n2. Speaker A's brother enjoys Brazilian food, specifically steak.\n3. Speaker A enjoys salsa dancing and is planning to go out dancing.\n4. Speaker B expressed interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A.\n5. Speaker B works as a bartender and enjoys meeting different people.\n6. Speaker A is interested in Speaker B's job as a bartender.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's awesome! Brazilian steak is definitely a must-try if you love steak. Have you ever been to a Brazilian steakhouse before?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that could be beneficial for generating the next response. For instance, sentences 1 and 2 (about Speaker A and their brother enjoying Brazilian food, specifically steak) can provide contextual cues related to the conversation about the food they had while watching the Black Widow movie. This information ties in with Speaker A's mention of having Brazilian foods and enjoying an amazing steak. However, the rest of the MEMORY (e.g., salsa dancing, healing methods, and Speaker B's job) is not directly relevant to the immediate dialogue context about Marvel movies and food but is naturally phrased. The information is relatively well-organized, though there is not a significant further development or connection with the current dialogue focus. Hence, a score of 3 is appropriate as it offers moderate helpfulness for contextually engaging responses."
