Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n2. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n3. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n4. Speaker B does not do a lot of cooking or baking but is interested in learning.\n5. Speaker B regrets not having the opportunity to spend quality time with their grandparents, who were busy running a grocery store before they passed away.\n6. Speaker A is eating their favorite jello.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's wonderful that you're passing on your grandmother's jello recipe to your kids! Family traditions really do hold a special place in our hearts. Maybe you can try a sugar-free version of the jello recipe to cut back on the sugar intake.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information, but it also contains details that are not directly relevant to the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 2, and 3 offer helpful context about Speaker A's connection to jello, which could facilitate a dialogue about jello recipes and family traditions. Sentence 2 might provide an opportunity for Speaker A to engage with or offer a suggestion to Speaker B. Sentence 5 and 6, however, are not particularly relevant to the conversation about family traditions, thus not as beneficial for generating the next response. Overall, the MEMORY has a mix of relevant and irrelevant information, but it somewhat captures the essence required for a continued dialogue revolving around traditional recipes and family values related to jello."
