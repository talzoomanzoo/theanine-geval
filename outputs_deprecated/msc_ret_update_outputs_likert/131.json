Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't! Just karate!

    "raw_prediction": "Italian subs are always a good choice! I'm looking forward to trying it out with you after our karate session tomorrow.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some potentially helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks direct relevance to the ongoing conversation. The MEMORY mentions Speaker B's involvement in karate, which is connected to the dialogue where Speaker B offers to introduce Speaker A to their dojo. This could help contextualize Speaker B's expertise and enthusiasm for karate. Additionally, Speaker B's enjoyment of water activities could tie into the mention of lifeguarding.\n\nHowever, many details, such as Speaker B's background in football, considerations for IT school, and Speaker A's love for seafood, do not directly contribute to the conversation about martial arts classes, karate, or the planned visit to the dojo and subsequent lunch. The information is structured in a naturally coherent manner, providing some context about Speaker B's activities and interests, although it could be more directly aligned with the ongoing dialogue to score higher in helpfulness."
