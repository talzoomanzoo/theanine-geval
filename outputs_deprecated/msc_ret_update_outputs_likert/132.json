Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n2. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n3. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n4. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n5. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n6. Speaker A believes in the importance of giving back and helping youth access resources.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't spoken to my advisor yet, but teaching does seem like a great option for me. I enjoy sharing knowledge and helping others learn, so becoming a college professor in linguistics could be a rewarding path for me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It indicates Speaker B's consideration of further education and career options, which is relevant to the context of discussing career advice and teaching. The mention of Speaker B's interest in becoming a college professor in linguistics is directly relevant to the suggestion of teaching as a career path. Moreover, the MEMORY highlights Speaker B's current feeling of limited job opportunities, which aligns with the context of seeking career advice. Additionally, the shared values of Speaker A and B regarding education and continuous learning add depth to their interactions. While some details, like Speaker A's interest in teaching computer science and volunteering activities, are not directly related to the immediate context, they are phrased naturally and maintain a coherent narrative of past interactions. This allows a language model to easily distinguish between relevant and less relevant details while formulating a response."
