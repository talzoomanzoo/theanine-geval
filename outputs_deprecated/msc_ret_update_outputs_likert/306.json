Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n4. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n5. Speaker A plays the clarinet in a band concert and has a solar investment for their office building.\n6. Speaker B is also interested in space exploration and plant science, expressing concerns about the fuels used for space travel.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! I'd be happy to help. What kind of plants are you thinking of growing in your garden?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several details that are helpful for Speaker B to generate a relevant and informed response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Firstly, it highlights Speaker B's knowledge about plants and gardening, which is directly relevant to Speaker A's request for gardening suggestions. Additionally, Speaker A's struggle with gardening and interest in space plants can guide Speaker B to offer specific advice or suggestions that might intrigue Speaker A. Although the MEMORY contains some unrelated information—like Speaker A playing the clarinet and having a solar investment—it remains coherent and naturally phrased, allowing these parts to be easily identified as less beneficial for the current context. The inclusion of Speaker B's shared interest in space exploration might also provide an avenue for future dialogues or interest alignment. Overall, the MEMORY is structured well, connecting past interactions and relevant interests between the speakers."
