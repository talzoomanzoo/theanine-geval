Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing? Speaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from? Speaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there. Speaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat?  Speaker A: I've thought of a lot of  names, but in the end it will probably depend on the breed and the sex.   Speaker B: That's true. Is pilates hard? I've always wanted to try it but I don't know if it will be too difficult. Speaker A: No, I don't think it's hard.  I actually enjoy it.  It's more fun than work, at least to me. You should give it a try! Speaker B: Maybe I will. Do you think I can start at home by watching Youtube videos, or do I need to go to a Pilates class? Speaker A: You can probably start with Youtube just to see if you like it.  Much better to go to a class I think though.  Of course, I'm biased. I'm in love with my instructor! haha Speaker B: Lol, okay I will definitely try it at home first. If I can get the hang of it, I will sign up for a class. Hopefully I can get an instructor as good as yours lol! \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n2. Speaker A reads a novel a week, lives in the city, and goes to pilates class.\n3. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets.\n4. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy the company of their pets and think they are smart and playful.\n5. Speaker A is interested in getting a dog and likes Akitas.\n6. Speaker B thinks pit bulls are lovely and has one that is kind and sweet.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm sure you'll find a great instructor! And who knows, maybe your pit bull will be interested in joining your Pilates sessions too. They're such curious and loving dogs, just like your sweet one.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information that are relevant and helpful to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, the fact that Speaker A goes to pilates class is pertinent as it directly links to the ongoing conversation about pilates. Additionally, Speaker B's interest in pets and painting portraits is related to the conversation about portraits and pets in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY sentences are naturally structured and provide context that could help build the relationship between the speakers and enrich the dialogue. However, some MEMORY sentences, such as Speaker B's preference for Persian cats or Speaker A's interest in Akitas, are not directly referenced in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Nonetheless, they still offer a deeper understanding of the speakers' characters and interests, which could be beneficial for generating nuanced responses. Thus, the MEMORY is quite supportive in generating a proper next response, hence a score of 4."
