Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand. Speaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n2. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n3. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments.\n4. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n5. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n6. Speaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's wonderful that you have the opportunity to spend quality time with your grandkids. I've been thinking about it, and I think it could be a great idea to start a tradition like that. It would be a nice change of pace for my own family too.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several pieces of information that are helpful in understanding the relationship between Speaker A and Speaker B, particularly in the context of their potential annual fishing trip. Several sentences relate to Speaker B's family dynamics and interests, such as taking grandkids fishing, wanting to make it a tradition, and the kids' interests in technology over other activities. These details directly connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B asks about the annual fishing trip and how Speaker B spends time with their grandkids. Additionally, there is information about Speaker A that offers insight into their personal challenges with managing time due to work, which helps explain their perspective on communication preferences. The MEMORY is well-organized and the sentences about the fishing trip are particularly relevant, furthering the development of the dialogue. However, not every sentence in MEMORY is explicitly related to the current topic of discussion, such as Speaker A's work situation, so it does not warrant a perfect score."
