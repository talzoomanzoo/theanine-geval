Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends? Speaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do. Speaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n2. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n4. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n5. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet.\n6. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds amazing! Camping under the Alaskan night sky must be a breathtaking experience. We could even try to catch the northern lights if we're lucky. I'll have to look into the best spots for stargazing in Alaska.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that can help in generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, sentences 2 and 5 indicate that Speaker B is unsure about what activities to do in Alaska and has not planned much, which aligns with the context of them looking for ideas for their trip. This background can help tailor Speaker B's responses in the dialogue by reflecting their uncertainty and need for information.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY does not directly address the specific topic of 'dog sledding' or the daylight/darkness issue discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Furthermore, while it mentions hiking and skiing, these details are not explicitly connected to the current dialogue's focus on different activities and daylight conditions in Alaska. \n\nOverall, while the MEMORY is relevant in terms of planning an Alaskan trip, it falls short of being fully comprehensive or directly useful concerning the specific issues raised in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
