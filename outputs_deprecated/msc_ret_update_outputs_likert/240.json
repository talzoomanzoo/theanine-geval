Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B shared tips on repelling mosquitos using sprays with 20% DEET and other active ingredients.\n2. Speaker B gets scared by bugs and creepy crawlies in the outdoors.\n3. Speaker B dislikes bugs and is not a fan of camping, hiking, or the outdoors.\n4. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n5. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n6. Speaker A enjoys camping trips and looking for wild animals in the woods.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a smart move! Those bracelets can be really handy, especially if you're going to be out in the woods for a while. I'm glad to hear you're taking precautions to keep those bugs at bay.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information that can assist Speaker B in generating a relevant response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 1 is directly relevant as it discusses repelling mosquitoes, which connects with Speaker A's statement about using repellent. Sentence 2 and 3, indicating Speaker B’s dislike for bugs and the outdoors, can provide additional context for their reaction or advice. Sentence 4 and 6 highlight Speaker A’s interest in outdoor activities, further anchoring Speaker B’s potential acknowledgment or counterpoints based on this history. However, Sentence 5 seems slightly less relevant because it might contradict the general sentiment of Speaker B’s dislike of bugs. The memory is somewhat helpful, but the sentences could exhibit clearer causality and relevance to the specific details of the dialogue context for a higher score."
