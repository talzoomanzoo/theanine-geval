Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden. Speaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways? Speaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n4. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n5. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n6. Speaker B's parents still live in Sweden, and they find it expensive to travel there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great that your cousin is helping you plan the trip! When you're in Sweden, you definitely have to visit the Vasa Museum in Stockholm and take a stroll around Gamla Stan. And don't forget to try some traditional Swedish meatballs!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides multiple relevant pieces of information that would be helpful for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context of traveling to Sweden and Speaker A's cousin is directly addressed by memories 2 and 3, which provide background on Speaker A's situation and an intention to travel. Memory 4 gives insight into Speaker B's feelings about Sweden, which could be useful for generating a sensitive response. Memory 6 could explain financial considerations related to the trip, even if those are not directly related to the current context. However, memory 1 is slightly misleading because it suggests a joint trip, which is not mentioned in the context. Despite this, most of the information is naturally connected, demonstrating clear relevance and development related to the current conversation. This warrants a score of 4."
