    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting! Speaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow? Speaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n2. Speaker B is considering giving up their night job to focus on lab work and school.\n3. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n5. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n6. Speaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate your kind words! It's definitely a tough decision to balance everything. And you're right, with advancements in technology, it's getting harder to discern where our food comes from. Who knows, maybe one day we'll all be enjoying burgers from cloned cows without even realizing it!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information about Speaker B's involvement in lab work and school, which directly connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is helpful to know that Speaker B is considering giving up a night job to focus on lab work, as it indicates their commitment, which ties into their concern about balancing classes and lab work. Additionally, the mention of Speaker B's interest in molecular biology and neuroscience provides context for their interest in the cow cloning project. Furthermore, the MEMORY contains well-structured sentences that clearly demonstrate the development and background of Speaker A and Speaker B, making it easier for a language model to understand their past interactions and generate a coherent response. Overall, the MEMORY is relevant and provides useful context, but some sentences are less directly related to the dialogue, such as Speaker A's plans to try the hamburgers or their involvement in different fields, which is why it does not receive a perfect score."
