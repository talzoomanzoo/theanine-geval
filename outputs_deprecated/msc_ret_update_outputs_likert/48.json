Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. Speaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?   Speaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n2. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n3. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n4. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B could pay a fee to a ranch to take care of a horse.\n5. Speaker B lives in the city and is interested in having a horse in the future.\n6. Speaker B is concerned about the cost of owning horses, including medical fees and expenses like horse shoes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's interesting that you find therapy in riding horses. Horses can be incredibly therapeutic animals. Maybe exploring your love for horses and how it ties into your past could be a valuable avenue to explore in therapy.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B being a therapist, which directly aligns with the current conversation topic. However, the remaining points in the MEMORY, like Speaker A's knowledge of horses and Speaker B's interest in owning a horse, are not directly relevant to the current context of the dialogue. Additionally, there is little information about the past interactions between the speakers and how they've developed to this point. Although the MEMORY is well-structured and easy to read, most of the information doesn't directly support the generation of the next response in the current conversation with a clear understanding of the two speakers' past interactions. Therefore, the score is on the lower side since the MEMORY lacks significant helpfulness for the current dialogue context."
