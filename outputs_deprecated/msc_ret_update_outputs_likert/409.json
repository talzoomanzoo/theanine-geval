Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that? Speaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading? Speaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha. Speaker B: Well if it's any good I know you'll be watching the whole thing. Speaker A: you know it.  And I know that you would just fall asleep during it whether it's any good or not.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n2. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n3. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n4. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n5. Speaker A suggests taking naps during quiet times and mentions watching her grandkids.\n6. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A having grandchildren and sometimes watching them, which aligns with Speaker A's mention of not watching their grandchildren in the current context. This information could help Speaker B respond appropriately by acknowledging this shared scenario. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions Speaker B's fascination with animals, which could serve as a context for Speaker B's preference for animal books over crime dramas. However, most of the MEMORY content focuses on Speaker A's habits and their grandchildren's activities, which are not directly linked to the primary conversation about books and potential Netflix adaptations. The MEMORY could be more effective if it included a deeper connection or more details about Speaker B's preferences or previous conversations about books or Netflix to create a more complete and naturally flowing context for the language model."
