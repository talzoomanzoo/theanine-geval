Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone?  Speaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!). Speaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol Speaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you. Speaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up? Speaker B: Nope, I just cleared my schedule until the Alps marathon that you're training for. It's just you and me until you break that finish line. I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up. Speaker A: Wow 4 am.  Is it too late to change my mind?lol\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n2. Speaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\n3. Speaker A is training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover.\n4. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety.\n5. Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\n6. Speaker B is considering running a marathon and mentioned fishing and feeling depressed.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "No way, it's never too late! Remember, the early bird catches the worm, or in your case, catches that marathon finish line. You've got this!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that is beneficial for generating a next response. The context of the dialogue involves discussions around motivational speaking, training for an Alps marathon, and Speaker B's role as a motivational speaker. Several points from the MEMORY align with this context: \n\n- Sentence 1 mentions Speaker A inviting Speaker B to train for the Alps marathon, which is directly relevant to the context where Speaker B mentions clearing their schedule for the marathon.\n- Sentence 2 highlights Speaker B's profession as a motivational speaker, which ties directly into the dialogue's focus on motivation.\n- Sentence 3 describes Speaker A's marathon training, aligning with the discussion of marathons in the dialogue.\n- Sentence 5 reiterates Speaker B's role in motivating others, which is pertinent to the context where Speaker B talks about motivating Speaker A.\n\nThe MEMORY provides a structured background that allows the language model to craft appropriate responses congruent with Speaker B's motivational role and the marathon theme discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Despite some sentences being less directly related (e.g., Sentence 4's details about Speaker B's personal struggles or Sentence 6's mention of fishing and feeling depressed), the MEMORY as a whole is well-structured and helpful for understanding the interaction between the speakers."
