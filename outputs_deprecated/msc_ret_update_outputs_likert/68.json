Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music. Speaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician.\n2. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend.\n3. Speaker A is part of a band that tours different countries for their music.\n4. Speaker A wants to see Sublime live one day but doesn't go to many concerts other than the ones their band plays in.\n5. Speaker A is planning a concert in Denver and offers to get tickets for Speaker B.\n6. Speaker A enjoys eating fish, particularly salmon or tuna.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for the language model to generate a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Given that Speaker B enjoys rock music, MEMORY sentences about Speaker A being in a band and their involvement in music (like playing the drums, writing music, and touring) can facilitate a relevant continuation of the conversation about favorite rock bands or musical experiences. Sentence 4 particularly ties to the context, reflecting Speaker A's interest in concerts, which could align with Speaker B's interest in rock music. \n\nHowever, some sentences in the MEMORY (e.g., Speaker A enjoys eating fish) do not directly contribute to the immediate dialogue and could slightly disrupt the focus. For these reasons, while there are useful connections to be made, the MEMORY does not achieve the highest possible relevance or fluidity throughout, but it still aids in constructing a meaningful response by providing useful insights into Speaker A's musical background."
