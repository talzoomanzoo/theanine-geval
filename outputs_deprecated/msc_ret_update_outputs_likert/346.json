Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n2. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n3. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n4. Speaker A is eating their favorite jello.\n5. Speaker B also enjoys jello, with cherry being their favorite flavor as well.\n6. Speaker B does not do a lot of cooking or baking but is interested in learning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's wonderful! Passing down family recipes is such a special tradition. Have your kids been enjoying learning how to make the jello?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides highly relevant and helpful information for generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Speaker A also has a strong connection to jello through their grandmother, which directly relates to Speaker B passing down their grandmother's jello recipe. This sets a common ground for both speakers, highlighting mutual interests and the tradition of learning recipes from grandmothers. The MEMORY includes key details such as Speaker A enjoying cherry jello and considering offering their grandmother as a surrogate for learning jello recipes. These aspects enrich the dialogue by providing common experiences and the development of interactions around family traditions and favorite flavors, making the MEMORY very helpful and naturally connected to the context."
