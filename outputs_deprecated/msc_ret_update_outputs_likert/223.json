Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food? Speaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too? Speaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also? Speaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways? Speaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid.\n2. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature.\n3. Speaker B has two terrier dogs as pets.\n4. Speaker B has elderly terriers and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for music and plan to have a house concert with their pets.\n6. Speaker B asks Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad to hear you're able to spend more time with your dogs now! It can be tough balancing work and pet care, but I try to make sure they have plenty of toys and activities to keep them busy while I'm away. Plus, coming home to their happy faces makes it all worth it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful context for generating a response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Key points like Speaker A having a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid are directly relevant, as they explain the pets mentioned in the conversation. Additionally, mentioning that Speaker B has two terrier dogs as pets is also useful, as it aligns with Speaker B's own references to having dogs. However, there is some irrelevant information, such as both speakers planning to have a house concert with their pets, and details about Speaker B's intention to take a break from their part-time job. These sentences, while naturally expressed, do not directly contribute to the conversational flow about pets and managing them, but they do not detract from the overall coherence. Therefore, the MEMORY is mostly helpful and well-structured."
