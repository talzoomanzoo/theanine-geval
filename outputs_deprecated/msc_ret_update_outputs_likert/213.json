Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!

Speaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain? Speaker A: I think age has really been my knees downfall. I also used to hike a lot and I put a lot of pressure on my legs. That is great that you only have a year. Maybe when you graduate you can come hang out on the beach with me. I can't surf but I would love to watch you. Speaker B: That would be fun!  I like collecting shells too so we could do that as well.  I have a small collection of ones I have from around the world.  The farthest away was from Greece.  Have you traveled a lot?

Have you gotten to visit other European countries?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys hiking along the coast and collecting shells, mentioning that their knees can't handle much else.\n2.

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't been to Europe yet, but it's definitely on my bucket list! I'd love to explore different countries and experience their cultures. Maybe one day I'll be able to add some European shells to my collection!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some relevant and helpful information for generating a response in the continuation of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker B's interest in sports medicine and their search for internships, which aligns with the dialogue where Speaker B discusses the importance of internships. However, not all memory sentences are directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, and some details are either not mentioned or inaccurately represented. For example, the suggestion that surfing could be a way to make connections in the medical field is not linked to the context discussed. Meanwhile, the MEMORY sentence about Speaker A hiking focuses on shell collecting and their knee issues, but it slightly misaligns with the nuance in the actual conversation where Speaker A talks about their past profession and retirement. Therefore, while MEMORY contains some useful information, its alignment and representation of key details could be more precise and connected to the context, leading to a mid-range score."
