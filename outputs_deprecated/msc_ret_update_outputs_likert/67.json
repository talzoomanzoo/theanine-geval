Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician.\n2. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend.\n3. Speaker A is part of a band that tours different countries for their music.\n4. Speaker A wants to see Sublime live one day but doesn't go to many concerts other than the ones their band plays in.\n5. Speaker B listens to Sublime a lot while relaxing on the beach.\n6. Speaker A enjoys eating fish, particularly salmon or tuna.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's cool! Rock music is great for just listening and enjoying. Do you have a favorite rock band or artist?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of information about Speaker A that are relevant and helpful for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it conveys that Speaker A is a musician in a band who writes music and plays the drums. This information relates directly to the question Speaker A asks about musical instruments. Additionally, the MEMORY includes details about Speaker A's musical interests and activities, such as touring and attending concerts, which could inform future dialogue about music. While there are a couple of details, like Speaker A's food preferences and Speaker B's listening habits, that are less directly relevant to the context, the MEMORY overall consists of naturally structured and connected information regarding the speakers' past interactions, making it quite helpful."
