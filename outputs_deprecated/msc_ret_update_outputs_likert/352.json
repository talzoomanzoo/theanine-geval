Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar. Speaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general? Speaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts. Speaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts? Speaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.  Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately? Speaker A: Water skiing? Yes, last weekend. It was so much fun!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is excited to join Speaker A's family for a water skiing trip and wants to learn from Speaker A's kids.\n2. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n3. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n4. Speaker B does not do a lot of cooking or baking but is interested in learning.\n5. Speaker A has been water skiing for 15 years and has 3 kids who also water ski.\n6. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a blast! I can't wait to join you all on the water skiing trip. I'm sure your kids are amazing at it, and I'm excited to learn from them.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 5 are relevant as they mention Speaker B's interest in joining Speaker A's family for a water skiing trip, which aligns with the topic of skiing in the dialogue. Sentence 4 also connects to Speaker B's interest in learning to bake, which is relevant to the context where Speaker B discusses their baking experiences. However, the other sentences (2, 3, and 6) about jello and Speaker A's grandmother don't provide direct contributions to the ongoing conversation about skiing or Speaker Bâ€™s cooking struggles. Hence, while some contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are present, there is room for clearer connections and more relevant development of past interactions. This warrants a mid-range score."
