Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A. Speaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now? Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n2. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n3. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n4. Speaker B feels overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and is eager to finish school to escape it.\n5. Speaker A advises Speaker B to take breaks and prioritize their own happiness and well-being.\n6. Both speakers value good grades and believe it can lead to better job opportunities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provided gives context that is helpful for generating a relevant response. The dialogue context is about exams, exam performance, and future exams. The MEMORY contains information that relates to Speaker B's academic pressure (due to their mother's position in the school) and their efforts in sports medicine, which connects nicely with the exam theme of the dialogue. The dynamic between both speakers regarding academic performance is illustrated, providing context for Speaker B's encouragement to Speaker A regarding grades. Some sentences such as Speaker A finding gym the only subject they excel in, are indirectly related but reflect the stress and relief aspects mentioned in the dialogue context. Overall, the MEMORY provides rich contextual cues related to academic stress and exams, which are relevant to the dialogue context. Though not all sentences are directly related to the current dialogue, they are well-structured and provide background information that may help generate a natural response."
