    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it. Speaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n2. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\n3. Speaker B is a member of the boy scouts and works at a fast food place\n4. Speaker B plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge for college applications.\n5. Speaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat.\n6. Speaker A is involved in church activities and mentioned a church retreat\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "**Helpfulness Score: 3**\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers some useful contextual information that can aid in generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not optimally structured for maximum helpfulness. \n\n1. **Helpful Points:**\n   - Memory 1: Speaker B's involvement with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years aligns with the thematic discussion in the dialogue about Boy Scouts, survival skills, and encouraging Speaker A's kids to get involved. Knowing the duration and current rank of Speaker B in Boy Scouts establishes credibility and depth in the subject matter.\n   - Memory 4: Speaker B’s plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge can be relevant to the discussion of skills and experiences gained through Boy Scouts.\n   - Memory 6: Speaker A's involvement in church activities and a church retreat could serve as a segway to discuss community activities, which relate to the social skills mentioned in the dialogue.\n\n2. **Less Helpful or Irrelevant Points:**\n   - Memory 2, 3, and 5: While these pieces offer insights into Speaker B’s life, such as working at a fast food place and being busy with multiple commitments, they are less directly related to the immediate goal of discussing Boy Scouts. These could be phrased better to show connections with the skills learned in scouting or how these influence Speaker B's availability to engage in more scouting activities, thus aiding the continuation of a relevant dialogue.\n\nWhile the MEMORY doesn't fully capitalize on creating a highly relevant and naturally flowing supplement to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it does provide certain key insights connecting Speaker B's experiences to the main subject. Further structuring and emphasis on these connections could make this MEMORY more helpful."
