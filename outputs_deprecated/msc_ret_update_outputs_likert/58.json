Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. Speaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk? Speaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous. Speaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n2. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks.\n3. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n4. Speaker A asks about Speaker B's new artwork and acknowledges their need for inspiration.\n5. Speaker A is a fan of the Game of Thrones series and enjoys audiobooks.\n6. Speaker A also enjoyed reading 'Redwall' growing up and keeps an eye out for similar books.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I didn't bring a pet this time, but I can imagine how nice it must be to explore the trails with a furry companion. It's so refreshing to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of the city and just immerse yourself in nature. I find it really inspiring, just like you do with your artwork.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that can enhance the conversation regarding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains helpful details about Speaker B's love for nature and working with animals, which aligns with their enthusiasm for trails and the mention of taking pets on walks. Additionally, Speaker A's detail of walking instead of driving is somewhat relevant to the current dialogue about nature walks. However, most of the other information, such as reading preferences and specific book series, does not contribute directly to generating a relevant next response based on the current context. While the memory is well-structured and naturally phrased, the direct relevancy to the dialogue context is limited, hence the score of 3."
