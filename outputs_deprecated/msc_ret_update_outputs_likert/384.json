Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think? Speaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons Speaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use. Speaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful? Speaker A: Most of them were not.  It really depends on where on your body you get them.  Most of mine are on areas that didn't hurt.  The one on my foot and the one behind my ear did hurt a good bit.  Where were you thinking about getting it? Speaker B: I hadn't really thought about it! Maybe upper arm or upper back? But I'm no tattoo expert. And I'd have to get permission from my wife first, LOL\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n2. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n3. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B have a conversation about their personal interests and trips they have taken for work.\n5. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n6. Speaker B enjoys fishing and wishes their wife and sons could have joined them on the trip.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Upper arm or upper back would be great spots for a tattoo! It's always good to consider your spouse's opinion too. It's a big decision, but it sounds like you're on the right track.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, sentences 1, 2, and 5 are relevant as they relate to Speaker A's tattoos and their mom, which are topics discussed in the dialogue. Sentence 1 provides context about the tattoos that Speaker A already has, which is helpful for understanding their motivation for getting more tattoos. Sentence 2 expands on the tattoo dedicated to their father, which aligns with Speaker A's mention of matching tattoos for their parents. Sentence 5 adds context by mentioning Speaker A's connection to their mom through the coffee shop, which could be relevant if the dialogue explores familial themes further. The other sentences in MEMORY, such as Speaker A working at a coffee shop and Speaker B enjoying fishing, are not directly related to the current dialogue but are presented in a coherent manner. Therefore, while not all sentences contribute directly to this specific dialogue, the MEMORY as a whole is reasonably well-structured and provides a degree of helpful context."
