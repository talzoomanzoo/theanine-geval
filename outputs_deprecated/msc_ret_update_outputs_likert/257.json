Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you? Speaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses. Speaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set? Speaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up. Speaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe? Speaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood. Speaker A: Chemicals!  Do the actors hate working with it then?  I can imagine they are a pretty high maintenance bunch.  Do they worry about the blood messing with their looks?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n2. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.\n3. Speaker A prefers classic horror movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th over modern ones.\n4. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n5. Speaker B's dad works on smaller projects and has never been involved in a major Hollywood film.\n6. Speaker B has a government job that pays the bills but wishes they could work in interior design.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Most of the actors are pretty professional about it. They understand it's all part of the job. We make sure to use safe and easy-to-remove blood so they don't have to worry too much about their looks. It's all about creating the right atmosphere on set.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not entirely focused or directly helpful. Sentence 1 in MEMORY is relevant as it mentions Speaker B creating horror movies and provides backstory about collaboration with their dad, which ties into Speaker B's involvement in movie production as mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 2 and 3 mention Speaker A's passion for horror movies and their preference for classic horror films, which are slightly useful as they reflect on Speaker A's interests, though the current dialogue mainly revolves around Speaker B's experiences. Sentence 6 ties into Speaker B's job situation and interests, relating slightly to their creative pursuits outside a government job. Sentences 4 and 5 provide additional context but are not directly connected to the ongoing dialogue about horror movie production or the use and impact of fake blood on set. Overall, MEMORY could offer more focused details directly supporting DIALOGUE CONTEXT's direction, but it provides a moderate level of contextual relevance."
