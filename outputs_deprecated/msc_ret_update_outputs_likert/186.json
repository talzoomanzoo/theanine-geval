    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make? Speaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\n2. Speaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally.\n3. Speaker A enjoys cooking and finds it helpful for stress relief.\n4. Speaker A plays the drums and loves making food for others.\n5. Speaker A cooked steak, fried potatoes, and shrimp for dinner with their father.\n6. Speaker B's grandmother was the matriarch of the family, known for cooking large meals for family gatherings.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds fantastic! I'd love to try your spicy fried rice. The combination of spice and comfort food is always a winner. Cooking together sounds like a great idea.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains useful information that can help generate a response in the dialogue context. In particular, Sentence 1 is directly relevant as it connects Speaker B's enjoyment of cooking and their value of their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe, tying into the context of the garlic chicken dish being discussed. Sentence 6 provides contextual insight into Speaker B's family background, which could be useful for adding depth or personal touch to the dialogue. Sentences 2 and 3 about Speaker A's enjoyment of cooking, and stress relief might not be directly relevant to the current dialogue context, but they are phrased naturally enough to provide some personality insight, aiding in shaping a response. However, some sentences, like 4 and 5, appear less connected to the immediate context of the garlic chicken and spicy foods conversation. Overall, though, the helpful memory supports generating a natural and contextually relevant response in the dialogue."
