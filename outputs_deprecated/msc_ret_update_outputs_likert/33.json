Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n4. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n5. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n6. Speaker B's parents still live in Sweden, and they find it expensive to travel there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY is fairly helpful in providing context for Speaker B to generate a proper next response in the dialogue. It contains information on both Speaker A and Speaker B's past interactions and sentiments related to Sweden, which is directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe sentences are well-structured and connected, offering a sense of continuity. For instance, Sentence 1 sets up their plan to travel together, which is essential for the shared context. Sentences 2 and 5 highlight Speaker A's financial considerations and personal connections in Sweden, adding depth to the context. Sentences 3 and 4 convey Speaker B's emotional connection to Sweden and the challenges posed by expenses, which might guide their response. Sentence 6 further emphasizes Speaker B's perspective on the cost of travel, linking it to family experience.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides a comprehensive backdrop for the dialogue, allowing Speaker B to produce a response that acknowledges both logistical and emotional aspects of the trip. The only reason it doesn't score a perfect 5 is that some redundancy exists (e.g., high expenses mentioned multiple times), though it doesn't significantly detract from its effectiveness."
