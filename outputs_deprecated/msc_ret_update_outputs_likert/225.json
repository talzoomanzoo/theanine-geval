Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food? Speaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too? Speaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also? Speaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways? Speaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy? Speaker A: I think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals. Speaker B: Yea, that totally makes sense! I just wanted time off to spend with the dogs and look for a better job elsewhere, I'm hoping that I'll be able to get a job outside of a warehouse!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has elderly terriers and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one.\n2. Speaker A works at a zoo and is willing to help Speaker B get an entry-level position there.\n3. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature.\n4. Speaker B is looking for a new job and is excited about the opportunity at the zoo.\n5. Speaker A mentions that entry-level positions at the zoo involve cleaning enclosures and feeding less dangerous animals but offer decent pay, training, benefits, and assistance with schooling.\n6. Speaker A works at a zoo and has tried playing music for the white tigers and home concerts for their pets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Taking a break to spend time with your dogs sounds like a wonderful idea. And looking for a new job outside of a warehouse could be a great change for you. If you're interested, I could help you with the application process for an entry-level position at the zoo. It could be a refreshing change of scenery for you!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful in generating a proper response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, MEMORY points 1, 2, and 4 directly relate to Speaker B's job situation mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. They mention Speaker B's dogs and Speaker A's profession, which aligns with the context where Speaker A talks about their experience of working at the zoo and Speaker B's interaction with their dogs. However, MEMORY might be more thorough if it included details about Sid and Journey, given they are a part of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Furthermore, MEMORY points 3 and 6 provide less relevant information concerning the specific flow of the dialogue, as Speaker B does not explicitly admire Speaker A's dogs for their peaceful nature, nor is there any mention of home concerts or playing music for tigers in the CONTEXT. Overall, MEMORY includes a mix of relevant and less relevant points, and the causal connections between some details are not entirely clear, leading to a mid-range score."
