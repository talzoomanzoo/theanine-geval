Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n3. Speaker B prefers animals to humans but acknowledges the importance of curing diseases.\n4. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n5. Speaker A is scared of sharks but finds the idea of going into a steel cage with them interesting.\n6. Speaker B goes to Hawaii for scuba diving and is considering studying marine life or a different type of animal.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I can see how that would be a plus! It must be nice not having to worry too much about their care. Do you ever take them out to explore or do they prefer to stay in their terrarium?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a good amount of helpful information that can assist a language model, representing Speaker A, in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY includes several relevant details about Speaker B's pet snakes (such as their names being Hansel and Gretel), which directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B discusses the low maintenance of their snakes. Additionally, the MEMORY helps establish a profile for Speaker B, indicating they have interests in animals and marine life, which could be valuable in understanding Speaker B’s preferences and potential future conversations. Moreover, the MEMORY describes Speaker A’s involvement in a lab and their views on animals and humans, providing a backdrop for past interactions, which might steer future dialogue. However, some elements such as Speaker A’s fear of sharks, while interesting, are less directly connected to the current dialogue. The MEMORY is generally well-structured and captures a sense of the development and connection between previous interactions, which makes it useful for the task at hand. Therefore, it’s rated a 4."
