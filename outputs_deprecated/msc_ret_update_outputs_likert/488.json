Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n3. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n4. Speaker A plans to bring sandwiches and fruit for the hike, specifically asking about veggie sandwiches for Speaker B.\n5. Speaker A will use the money earned from the store to buy the hammock online.\n6. Speaker B is excited about the idea of swimming in the lake, mentioning they have swum in cold water before.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been working part-time at a local coffee shop. It's been pretty fun, and I get to meet a lot of interesting people. But your job sounds great, especially with the hiking trail nearby. You'll have to let me know how it goes once you start!",
    "prediction": "**Helpfulness Score: 3**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers some useful information, but not all points are directly connected to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT or particularly helpful in generating a relevant response from Speaker B. \n\n1. **Relevancy & Connection:** \n   - Sentence 1 is relevant as it connects to the topic of Speaker A applying for the job, providing additional context on the location.\n   - Sentence 2 is somewhat helpful, giving context about the work environment at the store, albeit indirectly.\n   - The rest of the MEMORY (Sentences 3-6) provides additional context about Speaker A's background and future plans, but these details are not directly relevant to the current conversation about the job offer.\n\n2. **Causality/Development:**\n   - The MEMORY does a fair job of painting a picture of Speaker A's situation and motivations (e.g., why they might want a job at that store), but these elements are mostly auxiliary to the ongoing conversation.\n\n3. **Naturalness & Clarity:**\n   - The sentences are generally clear and natural on their own but don't strongly interconnect with the present dialogue context to provide a helpful narrative flow or prompt further conversation.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides some context that could potentially steer conversation in a relevant direction but lacks strong, direct ties to help significantly with generating the next response about work. This results in a mid-range score of 3 for helpfulness."
