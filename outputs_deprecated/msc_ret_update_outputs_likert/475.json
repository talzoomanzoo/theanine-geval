Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n2. Speaker A is training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover.\n3. Speaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\n4. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety.\n5. Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\n6. Speaker B is considering running a marathon and mentioned fishing and feeling depressed.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "The speech went well, thank you! I'm glad to hear you're looking for motivation. I actually know a few great motivational speakers who could help. I can connect you with someone who specializes in fitness motivation. Just remember, the first step is always the hardest, but once you get started, you'll build momentum and achieve your goals.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains several sentences that are naturally structured and clearly demonstrate the development and context of past interactions between the speakers. \n\n1. Sentence 1 connects directly to the dialogue context by highlighting the relationship between Speaker A and B in the context of running and motivation, which aligns with Speaker A's query about the speech related to running motivation. \n2. Sentence 3 and 5 also directly relate to the context by clarifying Speaker B's professional role as a motivational speaker and their purpose, which could assist in motivating Speaker A's friend to run again.\n3. Sentence 6 shows Speaker B's interest in running a marathon, aligning with the running theme, although the mention of fishing and feeling depressed doesn't directly contribute to the dialogue context.\n4. Sentence 2 and 4 provide broader context on the speakers' past interactions and backgrounds, respectively, including Speaker A's marathon interests and Speaker B's personal motivation journey, which could be contextually relevant but not directly about running related motivation.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides a cohesive narrative of the past interactions aiding the understanding of the current dialogue context, hence a score of 4."
