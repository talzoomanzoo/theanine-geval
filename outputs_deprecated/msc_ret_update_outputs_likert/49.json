Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. Speaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?   Speaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone. Speaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n2. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n3. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n4. Speaker B lives in the city and is interested in having a horse in the future.\n5. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B could pay a fee to a ranch to take care of a horse.\n6. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's very kind of you to offer. I appreciate it. Maybe I should give it a try, especially since you seem so passionate about helping others.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information that is somewhat relevant and could be helpful for Speaker A to generate a suitable response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it establishes Speaker B as a therapist (Memory 2) and links Speaker A's knowledge primarily to horses (Memory 3), which aligns with the conversation about therapy and horses in the dialogue. The mention of Speaker B having been working in their own practice for six years (Memory 6) gives a sense of their experience level, which could be relevant to the conversation about therapy. \n\nHowever, other pieces of MEMORY are less directly related or helpful, such as Speaker B's interest in Freudian theories regarding horses (Memory 1) or the mention of 'fee to a ranch' (Memory 5). While this does add a layer to their characters, it doesn't directly help in generating a next response in the context of discussing therapy and personal experiences.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides some relevant context but lacks a fully coherent connection to DIALOGUE CONTEXT that would make it highly useful for generating the next response."
