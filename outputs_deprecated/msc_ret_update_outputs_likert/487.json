    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n3. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n4. Speaker A plans to bring sandwiches and fruit for the hike, specifically asking about veggie sandwiches for Speaker B.\n5. Speaker A will use the money earned from the store to buy the hammock online.\n6. Speaker B's neighbor, John, is getting divorced and selling top-of-the-line camping gear.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I applied for a cashier position. I'm excited to start working there and save up for that hammock I've been eyeing online. It's going to be a great summer job!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that can aid in generating a proper response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, Memory 1 directly relates to the fact that Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store, which is relevant to the conversation about Speaker A being contacted for a job at the grocery store they applied to. Memory 3 gives background on Speaker A's situation and characteristics, which can be useful for crafting a nuanced and empathetic response to the good news. Memory 5 indicates Speaker A's future plans with the job earnings, which can add depth to the conversation about the job position. \n\nHowever, some memory parts are less directly related, such as Memory 2, 4, and 6, although they are phrased in a way that clearly marks them as supplementary and not detracting from the conversation's focus. Overall, the MEMORY is mostly helpful, containing naturally structured sentences that inform the personal and situational context of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
