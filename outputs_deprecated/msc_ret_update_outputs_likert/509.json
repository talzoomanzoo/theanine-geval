Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well? Speaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\n2. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour.\n3. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next.\n4. Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away.\n5. Speaker B is good at ice skating and suggests going to an ice skating rink during winter break.\n6. Speaker B has two sons, one who loves Chinese food like Speaker A, and the other who prefers Italian food.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I wish I could visit them soon, but unfortunately, with work and other responsibilities, it's a bit challenging for me to travel all the way to Europe. I'll just have to enjoy their stories and photos from their adventures abroad for now.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful information which can aid in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, sentences 1 and 3 are relevant to the context, as they mention Speaker A's sons being in Europe, which aligns with the question asked by Speaker B about visiting them. Sentence 5 also complements the context since it mentions ice skating, which was discussed by the speakers. The interconnectedness and coherence of the information aids in understanding the situation, such as identifying relationships and preferences of the sons. Although not every sentence is directly relevant, the information is well-organized and naturally phrased, allowing the model to easily identify and ignore what is not needed. This meets the criteria of demonstrating the development of the interaction and is more structured than not."
