Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position.  Speaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it? Speaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days.  Speaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living. Speaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n3. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n4. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n5. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n6. Speaker A is a college student studying Humanities and wants to finish college before looking for a job.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Of course! We could always use an experienced goalkeeper like you on our team. Plus, playing again would be a great way to stay active and relive those college soccer days.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relatively helpful information for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory indicates that both Speaker A and Speaker B have interests related to soccer, which correlates well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they are discussing soccer positions, playing, and the possibility of joining games together. Specifically, MEMORIES 1, 2, 4, and 5 mention Speaker A's active participation in soccer, which can be related to their interest in being a voice in soccer video games and to Speaker B's potential desire to join Speaker A's games for exercise. \n\nMINOR GAPS: Memories 3 and 6 don't connect directly to the present dialogue context, making them slightly less helpful. Nonetheless, the overall structure and content of the memory tie well with the dialogue theme and could easily support a language model in generating contextually relevant responses."
