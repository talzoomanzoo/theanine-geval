    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that? Speaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading? Speaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n2. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n3. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n4. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n5. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n6. Speaker A enjoys watching Jeopardy with their grandchildren and cooking for them, with the busiest time being the weekend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's exciting! Maybe it'll be one of those Netflix shows you end up binging because it's rated over 3.5 stars. Who knows, it might even rival your Jeopardy nights with the grandkids!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that can be useful for a language model generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it confirms Speaker A's interest in Netflix (sentence 1), which is relevant to the discussion about the book potentially being adapted into a Netflix movie. Additionally, sentence 3 supports the initial context about watching grandkids. \n\nHowever, several details in the MEMORY, such as sentences 4, 5, and 6, do not directly contribute to the current conversation. They provide context about Speaker A's life, which is helpful in understanding their background, but does not have strong direct relevancy or causality ties with the ongoing discussion about books, movies, or specific interests in the dialogue.\n\nIn turn, while the MEMORY presents useful background information, the connection and relevancy to the specific details within the DIALOGUE CONTEXT are moderate, hence the score provided."
