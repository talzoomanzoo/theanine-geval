Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A. Speaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n2. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n3. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n4. Speaker A advises Speaker B to take breaks and prioritize their own happiness and well-being.\n5. Both speakers value good grades and believe it can lead to better job opportunities.\n6. Speaker B feels overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and is eager to finish school to escape it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful context for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives relevant background information about Speaker B's academic stress and familial pressure, which is relevant to the ongoing conversation about exams and academic performance in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY mentions that Speaker B is taking exams, studies sports medicine, and feels pressure to maintain good grades, which aligns with Speaker B's current situation in the conversation. \n\nAdditionally, the detail about Speaker A advising Speaker B to take breaks and prioritize well-being could offer a sense of continuity in Speaker A's supportive approach in the conversation. However, the MEMORY could benefit from further specificity regarding how these elements have fit into previous interactions between the speakers. Overall, the memory is detailed and relevant, although some parts are less directly connected to the immediate dialogue, making it a well-structured collection of background information."
