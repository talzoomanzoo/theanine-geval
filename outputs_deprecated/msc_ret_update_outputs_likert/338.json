Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation. Speaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon? Speaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch?  Speaker B: There is a horror genre movie that was released just this week which I'm going to watch tonight. It is called \"Girl Next.\"\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences.\n3. Speaker B enjoys watching suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy.\n4. Speaker A enjoyed the movie \"Coming to America\" and expressed interest in watching its sequel.\n5. Speaker A relies on Speaker B for movie suggestions, mentioning a preference for comedies.\n6. Speaker B recommended \"Coming 2 America\" and \"I-SPY\" starring Eddie Murphy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY in this case provides some helpful information for predicting the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it could be improved. Here's a breakdown of the helpfulness:\n\n1. The MEMORY correctly identifies that Speaker A is interested in watching movies and mentioned \"Pulp Fiction,\" which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A recently watched \"Pulp Fiction\" and liked it.\n2. The fact that Speaker B provides movie recommendations is explicitly supported by the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n3. MEMORY also highlights different genres that Speaker B enjoys, which could be helpful for generating future recommendations, even though it doesn't directly tie to the current context.\n4. The MEMORY mentions \"Coming to America,\" which has been brought up in the context, but incorrectly attributes the sequel as already watched when, in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it's stated as the next movie Speaker A wants to watch.\n5. There is a mention of a preference for comedies and relies on Speaker B for movie suggestions. This is partially represented in the context as Speaker A seems to follow Speaker B's suggestions.\n6. It inaccurately reports that Speaker A expressed interest in watching the sequel and incorrectly lists \"I-SPY,\" which is not mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nOverall, MEMORY contains both information that is directly related and some points that cover the broader preference scope. However, there are discrepancies that could confuse the language model, and some helpful contextual connections could be more explicit. This results in a moderate score of 3."
