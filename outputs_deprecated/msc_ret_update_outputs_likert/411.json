Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that? Speaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading? Speaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha. Speaker B: Well if it's any good I know you'll be watching the whole thing. Speaker A: you know it.  And I know that you would just fall asleep during it whether it's any good or not. Speaker B: Is there a lot of violence in your book? I couldn't stand to read it if there was.  Speaker A: There's a little bit.  Mostly just when describing how the crimes occurred though.  There are also some fight scenes between the cops and the criminals.  It's not too bad.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n2. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n3. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n4. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n5. Speaker A suggests taking naps during quiet times and mentions watching her grandkids.\n6. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information for generating a future response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not directly relevant to the specific conversation topic of the crime drama book. Here are the considerations:\n\n- Sentence 1: Although referencing Netflix aligns with Speaker A's consideration of subscribing to Netflix for a movie adaptation, it lacks specificity about crime dramas and the current context; this is marginally helpful.\n- Sentence 2 and 5: These sentences align with Speaker A's mention of watching grandchildren, providing background information but are not directly relevant to the current dialogue regarding the book.\n- Sentence 4: This sentence highlights Speaker B's interest in animals, relevant to Speaker B's expressed interest in animal books, affording minor context for the dialogue theme of differing book preferences.\n- Sentences 3 and 6: These sentences are somewhat relevant to Speaker A's past interactions with her grandchildren but add little to the ongoing focus on the book discussion.\n\nThe MEMORY lacks a direct link to the specific crime drama and more narrowly related book interests, limiting its utility in contributing to future dialogue. However, it does provide context for understanding the broader interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B. Hence, a score of 3 reflects moderate helpfulness."
