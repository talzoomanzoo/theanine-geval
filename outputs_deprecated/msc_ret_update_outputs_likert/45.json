Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n2. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n3. Speaker B is a professional in a practice, where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients.\n4. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n5. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n6. Speaker A is married and has been for four years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's really admirable. It must be fulfilling to make a positive impact on people's lives.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for Speaker A, specifically about Speaker B's profession and interests, which can aid in forming a more tailored and engaging response. Sentences 1 and 4 provide context about Speaker B's career, which is relevant to the dialogue context as Speaker B is explaining their motivation for becoming a therapist. Sentence 3 relates to the context of their professional boundaries, which might be useful for future dialogue. However, sentences 2, 5, and 6, while interesting, are not directly relevant to the immediate dialogue context. The MEMORY lacks explicit connections between sentences but provides a reasonable level of helpfulness in identifying useful cues related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, hence the score of 3."
