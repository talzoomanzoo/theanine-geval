Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. Speaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n2. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n3. Speaker A asks about Speaker B's new artwork and acknowledges their need for inspiration.\n4. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks.\n5. Speaker A recommends the new album by Highly Suspect to Speaker B.\n6. Speaker A is a fan of the Game of Thrones series and enjoys audiobooks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I went to a nearby park with a beautiful trail that passes by a river and through a small forest. It was so peaceful and refreshing.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information for generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly sentences 1 and 4. Sentence 1 indicates Speaker B's love of nature and living in the country, which aligns well with the context of a nature walk. Sentence 4 connects nature walks to Speaker B's artistic inspiration, which could be relevant to Speaker A's experience and conversation topics. However, the rest of the MEMORY, while naturally structured, doesn't offer much direct relevance to the current context of the nature walk discussion. Sentences 2, 3, 5, and 6 focus on unrelated aspects like commuting habits, new artwork, music recommendations, and entertainment preferences that are not directly useful for the ongoing dialogue. Overall, there is some helpful contextual information, but it's limited, and the connections are not fully developed for the dialogue at hand."
