Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n2. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n3. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n4. Speaker B is a professional in a practice, where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients.\n5. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n6. Speaker A is married and has been for four years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've always been fascinated by the human mind and behavior. I wanted to help people navigate through their struggles and find a way to lead happier, more fulfilling lives. It's a rewarding profession that allows me to make a positive impact on others.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for Speaker B to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, points 1 and 2 are directly helpful as they outline Speaker B's occupation as a therapist and provide background on their professional experience, which is relevant to the question asked by Speaker A in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nOther memories, such as points 3, 4, and 5, offer indirect context about Speaker B's interests and professional limitations, which could help guide the conversation. Memory point 3's mention of Freudian theories, while not directly connected to the question, could potentially be used to enrich a more extensive discussion about their professional journey and interests. Point 4, while defining professional boundaries, is not directly relevant to the question regarding Speaker B's decision to become a therapist.\n\nMemory points 5 and 6 pertain to Speaker A's background. While useful for understanding Speaker A's knowledge base and personal life, they do not directly assist Speaker B in answering the specific question asked by Speaker A regarding their choice of profession.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY contains some contextually relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks a strong, clear narrative or connection between Speaker B's past interactions and the current query. It partially fulfills the criteria but requires more focused information directly relevant to Speaker B's career decision-making process to offer a higher score."
