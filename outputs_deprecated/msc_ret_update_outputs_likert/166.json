Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me? Speaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights.\n2. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\n3. Speaker A has visited Alaska and describes it as beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage.\n4. Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n5. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B discussed airlines charging extra fees.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "The weather has been quite pleasant this week, not too cold. I hope you find affordable tickets soon. Let me know if you need any help with that!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a substantial amount of helpful information for understanding the relationship and planning between Speakers A and B, even if not all parts are directly related to the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 2, 4, and 5 directly support and expand upon the context of Speaker B waiting for ticket prices to visit Speaker A, highlighting the mutual intent and excitement for the visit, including planned activities. Sentence 3, although not directly linked to the current conversation, could help establish a broader context about travel costs, aligning with Speaker B's airfare concerns. Sentence 6 about airlines charging extra fees also complements the conversation about watching airfare. Overall, the connections among the sentences are clear, and they are crafted in a natural way that maintains continuity with the context, making it easy for a language model to discern useful information even when not all sentences are immediately relevant. However, the lack of specific reference to the weather inquiry stops it short of being a 5, as more direct linkage to all aspects of the current context would represent a top score."
