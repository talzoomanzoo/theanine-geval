Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends? Speaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do. Speaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars. Speaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there,  Speaker A: You'd have to get some serious blackout curtains for when it was daylight lol! You'll have to stock up on some warm essentials before heading out. You definitely don't want to get stuck in a bad situation in the cold, especially if you're alone. I bet they have great ice cream! You'll have to tell me about it when you get back! Speaker B: Yeah, I need to call my friend and find out what season they are in so I can pack accordingly. I will take pictures of the ice cream too so I can tell you about it. I wonder if there are a lot of bears there? I don't like bears either. Speaker A: I'm pretty sure they have grizzlies up there. You better pack something to fend them off too just in case. I bet your friend knows everything you'd need to keep them away.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n2. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\n3. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n5. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking.\n6. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'll definitely ask my friend about the bear situation. I'm not keen on any close encounters with them either. It's good to be prepared for anything, especially in the wilderness. I'll make sure to pack some bear spray or something to keep them at a safe distance. Thanks for the heads up about the grizzlies!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY does provide some helpful context for Speaker B's Alaska trip planning, such as Speaker B's uncertainty about activities in Alaska (point 2) and the general idea of an Alaskan vacation (point 6). However, the MEMORY lacks specific reference to dog sledding, daylight variability, grizzly bears, and ice cream, which were prominent in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While points 1, 3, 4, and 5 are related to outdoor activities and familiarity with Alaska, they don't directly support the topics discussed in the dialogue context. Overall, the MEMORY provides a general background of Alaska-related conversations, which is somewhat helpful but not directly aligning with the specific topics discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
