Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n2. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n3. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n4. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n5. Speaker B is a professional in a practice, where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients.\n6. Speaker A is married and has been for four years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I do still enjoy it, even after all these years. It can be challenging at times, but it's incredibly rewarding to see the progress and growth in my clients. Plus, it's a field where I can constantly learn and grow myself, which keeps it interesting.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information that provide helpful context for Speaker B's response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, points 1 and 4 are directly relevant, as they reinforce context about Speaker B being a therapist (aligning with the current topic of conversation about Speaker B's occupation). Point 4 also subtly conveys Speaker B's experience, which can add depth to the conversation about enjoying their job. Additionally, understanding Speaker B's interest in helping people (point 5, though not directly stated, might be inferred from their professionalism) helps reinforce why they might enjoy their work.\n\nHowever, other pieces of information, such as Speaker B's support for a football team (point 1) or interest in the psychological aspects of owning a horse (point 2), are not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Therapist B's job satisfaction, although they form a rounded character profile. Similarly, Speaker A's knowledge about horses and marital status (points 3 and 6) do not drastically benefit a reply about why Speaker B enjoys their work, as these arenâ€™t components of the current interaction's focus.\n\nWhile the memory pieces are logically structured and form a cohesive character sketch, only portions directly inform the conversation's flow and direction. Hence, it receives a mid-level score indicating partial relevance."
