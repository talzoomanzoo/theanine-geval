    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar. Speaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general? Speaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n2. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n3. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n4. Speaker A is eating their favorite jello.\n5. Speaker B does not do a lot of cooking or baking but is interested in learning.\n6. Speaker B also enjoys jello, with cherry being their favorite flavor as well.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I totally get that! It's surprising how much sugar goes into desserts. Maybe you can try experimenting with low-sugar or sugar-free recipes to satisfy your sweet tooth without the guilt. You could even try making a healthier version of jello using natural sweeteners or fruit juices.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. Some memories are relevant, like Speaker B's interest in learning to cook and bake (similar to what's mentioned in the context about teaching and watching baking videos). \n2. The shared interest and connection to jello (cherry favorite for both) in MEMORY points can relate to parts of the conversation about jello recipes.\n3. However, some items aren't directly helpful or add much to developing a dialogue response to the current context (e.g., Speaker A's specific connection to their grandmother is less useful here).\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides some potentially useful cues but lacks a very strong direct connection that makes its full content optimally supportive. More explicit connections or developments related to Speaker B's baking journey would enhance it."
