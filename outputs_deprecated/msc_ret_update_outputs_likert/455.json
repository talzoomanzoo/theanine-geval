Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad. Speaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has devices to keep bugs away and offers to share the product names with Speaker B.\n2. Speaker B regrets their green and purple color scheme and is willing to give away their purple furniture.\n3. Speaker A is looking to redecorate their house and likes purple furniture.\n4. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n5. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That color scheme sounds refreshing. I was also considering a neutral palette with pops of green or yellow. Your bug-repelling lamp sounds interesting, that would definitely come in handy during our barbecue night.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It offers insights into the past interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B, such as their discussions about home decor and furniture. This is directly relevant to the color scheme and furniture exchange mentioned in the context. Sentences like Speaker B's regret about their green and purple color scheme, and Speaker A's interest in purple furniture, contribute meaningfully to understanding their history and ongoing conversation. Additionally, mentions of bug prevention tie in with Speaker A's suggestion to bring a lamp that gets rid of bugs. While not every sentence in the MEMORY is directly relevant to the immediate context of the barbecue or guitar playing, they are presented in a natural and coherent manner, aiding the language model in generating an informed response. There could be slightly more explicit linkage between some MEMORY sentences and the current context for a perfect score, but overall, it provides a clear exposition of past interactions which can inform future responses."
