Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week? Speaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n2. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n3. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n4. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy playing video games in their free time.\n6. Speaker B likes to play golf when not playing video games.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I didn't get a chance to play Resident Evil this week, but I did dive back into Jurassic Park: World. It's always a fun time exploring the park and taking care of the dinosaurs.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several sentences that are directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it quite helpful. Sentence 1 is particularly pertinent since it highlights the plan to play games together and specifically mentions Resident Evil, which is the focus of the current dialogue. Sentence 2 offers additional context by noting Speaker B's enjoyment of video games and recent purchase of Resident Evil VIII, which lends depth to Speaker B's involvement with the game. Sentence 3, about Resident Evil being scary and providing tips, aligns well with the discussion of the game. Sentence 4, showing Speaker A's hesitancy to try Resident Evil, adds relevant context to their conversation. The other sentences, while not directly connected to the current dialogue, are presented in a natural manner that helps outline the previous interactions and shared interests between the speakers. This coherent and relevant presentation earns the MEMORY a score of 4 for its helpfulness."
