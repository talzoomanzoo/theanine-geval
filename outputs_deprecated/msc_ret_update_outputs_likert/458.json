Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad. Speaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs! Speaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours? Speaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock?  Speaker B: I guess I was going to get like an umbrella table and some chairs to go with it or maybe even a screened in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices.\n2. Speaker A is looking to redecorate their house and likes purple furniture.\n3. Speaker A recently bought new furniture for their house, including a couch, recliner, and patio furniture.\n4. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n5. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n6. Speaker B regrets their green and purple color scheme and is willing to give away their purple furniture.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "A screened-in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle sounds like a cozy and inviting setup for your patio! It would be a great addition to your green and purple color scheme dilemma. Ikea has some great options for outdoor furniture that could complement that look. Plus, it'll be perfect for our summer evenings with music, food, and good company.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about Speaker A and Speaker B's interest in furniture and home decor choices, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, much of the MEMORY is not directly aligned with the specific conversation flow in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, the MEMORY mentions Speaker A redecorating their house and buying new furniture, which has not been brought up in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, Speaker A is described as looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside, which may be implied by the context but is not explicitly discussed. The most relevant point in the MEMORY is Speaker B's regret over their green and purple color scheme, as this directly aligns with their current conversation regarding color choices. Overall, while the MEMORY provides some relevant elements, it contains many statements that do not naturally progress from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT or help in generating a coherent, contextually appropriate response, which limits its overall helpfulness."
