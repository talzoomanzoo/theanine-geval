    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that? Speaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n2. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n3. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n4. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n5. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n6. Speaker A was influenced by Alex Trebek and Ken Jennings to develop a love for books and reading.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains several sentences that provide partial context to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, only some of these are directly useful. For example, sentences 1 and 4 establish Speaker A's relationship with their grandchildren which somewhat ties to the context as it begins with Speaker A mentioning not watching the grandkids. Sentence 1 also mentions Speaker B's fascination with animals, which connects to their preference for animal books mentioned in the context. Sentence 2 adds some background to why Speaker A might seek rest (by reading a book), though it doesn't directly aid the immediate conversation about a crime drama book.\n\nHowever, sentences like 3 and 6 are mostly irrelevant to the current dialogue about book genres and preferences. While these sentences are complete and naturally structured, they don't lend any new information relevant to the specific exchange. Thus, the MEMORY demonstrates some useful connections but overall provides limited support to drive a helpful next response. The score reflects this partial relevance and coherency."
