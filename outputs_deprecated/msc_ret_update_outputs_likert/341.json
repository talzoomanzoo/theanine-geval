Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation. Speaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon? Speaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch?  Speaker B: There is a horror genre movie that was released just this week which I'm going to watch tonight. It is called \"Girl Next.\" Speaker A: Oh that sounds interesting, I will look into that and put it on my list. How has your job been going? Is there where you get all these great ideas for what to watch?   Speaker B: My Film Studies professor job has been going absolutely great lately. I love all my students, because they really get into the lectures and ask lots of questions. Yes, my job requires me to watch movies all the time, so that is how I find the best ones. Is your programmer job going all right lately? Speaker A: That sounds amazing. Super lucky to have students that really enjoy what they are learning about and I’m sure that’s down to the way you teach and what you teach them. I’m so glad it is all going well for you. Yeah it is going much better now, I’m really getting in the swing of things thank you for asking. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences.\n2. Speaker B used to teach Film Studies and carefully chooses what movies to watch.\n3. Speaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman.\n4. Speaker A relies on Speaker B for movie suggestions, mentioning a preference for comedies.\n5. Speaker B enjoys watching suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy.\n6. Speaker B has kids and enjoys watching movies with them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate your kind words. Teaching film studies is truly my passion, and I'm glad it shows in my students' enthusiasm. I'm thrilled to hear that things are going better at your programmer job. Finding your stride in a new role can take some time, but it sounds like you're getting there. If you ever need a break from coding, I have a great comedy recommendation for you!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information for a language model representing Speaker B to generate a proper next response. It clearly outlines Speaker B's expertise and interest in movies, including teaching Film Studies and recommending films like \"Pulp Fiction\" to Speaker A. Points 1 and 2 are directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and support the conversation about movie recommendations and Speaker B's job. Memory point 3 is partially relevant as it ties Speaker A's interest in movies with the conversation. Points 4, 5, and 6 add additional context about their movie preferences and Speaker B’s family, which although not directly related to the current conversation, could be useful in shaping future interactions. The memory is mostly coherent and naturally structured, but there's room for improvement by making the connection between all memory items and the dialogue context more evident and removing or rephrasing less related points such as point 6, which doesn't contribute much to the current dialogue context."
