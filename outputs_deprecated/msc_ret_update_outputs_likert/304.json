    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods. Speaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about? Speaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America. Have you seen any of those movies? Speaker B: No I haven't seen any of those. What foods did you eat while watching the movie? Speaker A: Wow, there are so many of the movies out there. Don't go see Black Widow without watching Avengers first. I had an amazing steak and vegetables on the side that were delicious. What is you favorite food?  Speaker B: Oh ok I definitely will watch those first! I love both steak and vegetables! I am a real foodie and love just about everything that isn't too strange to try lol. Speaker A: Oh wow! Do you like sushi? I love it but the sea urchin is a little crazy lol. Have you ever eaten sea urchin? Speaker B: I have never tried sea urchin or sushi but I do like crab legs and shrimp! Do you ever consider any foods to be good for healing? I find that you do healing very fascinating! Speaker A: Yes, in fact I consider almost all foods to either be healing, harmful or neutral. In my opinion people should choose foods based on how they want to feel. Sushi is fresh and healthy so I considerate it to be very healing. Speaker B: That is very wise thinking. Which vegetables do you feel are the best for healing? Are there any that should be avoided?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B expressed interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A.\n2. Speaker A's brother enjoys Brazilian food, specifically steak.\n3. Speaker A and their brother enjoy going to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner.\n4. Speaker A finds being on the water therapeutic and relaxing.\n5. Speaker A is a Reiki practitioner who also works with meditation.\n6. Speaker B works as a bartender and enjoys meeting different people.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I believe that vegetables like spinach, kale, broccoli, and carrots are fantastic for healing due to their high nutritional content. However, vegetables with high levels of pesticides or processed varieties might be best avoided for optimal healing benefits. What are your favorite vegetables to include in your meals?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some helpful and relevant information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, Memory 1 provides context on Speaker B's interest in healing methods, which aligns well with the dialogue's focus on foods for healing. Memory 5, mentioning Speaker A's connection to Reiki and meditation, could also contribute meaningfully to the dialogue about healing. However, the remaining memories (2, 3, 4, 6) do not significantly contribute to the specific conversation about foods, movies, or healing, which is the current focus of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While these memories are naturally phrased and well-structured, they are not particularly relevant for generating the next response in the given context. Thus, the MEMORY provides partial helpfulness in informing the model's response."
