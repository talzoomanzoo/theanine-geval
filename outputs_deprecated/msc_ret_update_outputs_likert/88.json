Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a painter and is working on a portrait for Speaker A.\n2. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets.\n3. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n4. Speaker A has a brother and might commission a family portrait from Speaker B.\n5. Speaker B has 5 dogs of different breeds and has rats as pets but didn't include them in the portrait.\n6. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy the company of their pets and think they are smart and playful.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a helpful background for understanding the relationships and interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B. Sentence 1 is explicitly relevant as it highlights that Speaker B is working on a portrait for Speaker A, tying directly to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where the portrait is mentioned. Sentences 2 and 6 provide helpful context about Speaker B's artistic preferences and mutual interest in pets, which could influence future dialogue about the portrait and pet-related discussions. Sentence 3, about the Persian cats and imagined interactions, might indirectly contribute to the context of the conversation about pets. Sentence 4 introduces the possibility of future commissions, showing the ongoing professional relationship between the two speakers. Sentence 5, though not directly relevant to the immediate context, reinforces Speaker B's connection with animals, which may influence their painting style or conversations about pets. Overall, the MEMORY provides useful contextual information, though not all sentences are directly applicable to the immediate dialogue, which prevents it from scoring a perfect 5."
