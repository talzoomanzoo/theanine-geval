Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know.  Speaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like. Speaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too. Speaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you? Speaker A: Just my doggy Drunky.  You never know,  I might meet a nice lady out there.  Speaker B: Totally.  There will be a bunch of women there and it'll be easy to strike up conversations.  Just be confident and I'm sure you could walk away with a bunch of numbers.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n4. Speaker A mentions Drunky, who is likely a pet.\n5. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.\n6. Speaker A is a guitar player and values jam time over social time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. In particular, memory points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are directly useful. They provide context around Speaker B's wife's pregnancy and their consideration for attending the festival, which is pertinent to the conversation about attending the bluegrass show. Additionally, MEMORY point 4 mentioning Drunky aligns well with Speaker A's plan to bring the dog along, and point 2 confirms both speakers' shared interest in bluegrass music, which is the subject of this interaction. MEMORY point 5, while indirectly related, offers insight into Speaker B's feelings about the situation, adding a layer of understanding to the interaction. MEMORY point 6, although it might not have direct relevance to the current context, contributes to the general understanding of Speaker A's character and interests. Overall, the MEMORY is structured in a way that it supports the generation of relevant and nuanced responses in the context of the bluegrass festival discussion."
