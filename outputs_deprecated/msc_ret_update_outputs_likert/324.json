Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n2. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue.\n3. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n4. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n5. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n6. Speaker B keeps a turquoise lotus origami on their desk from Japan.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's amazing! Congratulations on winning 3rd Place in the origami contest! It's a great achievement, and adding it to your CV/resume shows your dedication and talent in origami.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a coherent and contextually relevant response. It clearly shows past interactions and mutual interests between Speaker A and Speaker B regarding origami, which is central to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences convey that Speaker A enjoys origami and has attempted specific projects, while Speaker B is also interested in origami animals. This shared interest could feed into Speaker B's next response. Although not all sentences are directly related to the context of the origami contest achievement, they are naturally phrased and provide a cohesive background about Speaker A's passion for origami, which enhances Speaker B's ability to generate a relevant reply."
