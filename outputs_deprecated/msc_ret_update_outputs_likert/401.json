Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n2. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n3. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n4. Speaker A suggests taking naps during quiet times and mentions watching her grandkids.\n5. Speaker A is older and babysits their grandchildren about four days a week and most weekends.\n6. Speaker A enjoys watching Jeopardy with their grandchildren and cooking for them, with the busiest time being the weekend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a relaxing way to spend your day off from babysitting. What book did you pick up?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information for Speaker B to generate a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY effectively captures the relationship between Speaker A and their grandchildren, mentioning Speaker A's role in babysitting and typical activities they enjoy together. Most sentences highlight relevant aspects of Speaker A's routine and interests when interacting with their grandchildren, which is directly linked to Speaker A's statement about not watching them today and instead opting to read a book. The information is presented in a coherent manner, showing a clear understanding of past interactions, including how often Speaker A babysits and what activities are involved. This continuity and contextual development provide ample background for a language model to craft an appropriate response. However, the MEMORY could be slightly improved by offering more direct connections to the choice of reading a book specifically, prompting a slightly less than perfect score."
