Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping? Speaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures.\n2. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n3. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n4. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys.\n5. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n6. Speaker A is offering advice and seems to have experience with children.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "One of our favorite places to camp is by the lake up in the mountains. It's so peaceful and beautiful there. But sometimes I worry about leaving our kitten alone at home while we're away.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe memory provided has some useful information but lacks direct relevance to the current dialogue context. Sentences 1 and 2 establish that Speaker B is a parent who is involved in their daughter's activities, which could be helpful for maintaining an understanding of the relationship dynamics, especially in regard to family-oriented activities like camping. However, sentence 1 mentions a concern about leaving a kitten alone during camping, which does not directly aid in generating the next response about favorite camping locations. \n\nMemories related to the zoo (sentences 2, 3, 4, and 5) are not directly relevant to a conversation about camping but illustrate shared interests, which might be helpful for broader conversation development. Sentence 6 suggests that Speaker A has experience with children, providing more personal context but not specifically enriching the conversation about camping.\n\nOverall, while the memory provides some insights into the interests of both speakers and their family-related concerns, it is not tightly focused on the immediate topic of camping and favorite locations, hence the middling score."
