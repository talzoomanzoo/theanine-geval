Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career. Speaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday. Speaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. Speaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach? Speaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option. Speaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n3. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n4. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n5. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n6. Speaker B suggests trying the game Elder Scrolls, knowing Speaker A plays World of Warcraft.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information, such as the fact that Speaker B is studying linguistics and has an interest in teaching and academia, which is helpful in understanding Speaker B's context about considering teaching English or history. However, it lacks direct information about Speaker B's interest in teaching either English or history, despite these topics being mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, while some items in the MEMORY (like Speaker B volunteering at educational institutions) might relate to education, they are not directly connected to the specific career decision and teaching subjects discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Other pieces of information, such as Speaker B's recommendation to try the game Elder Scrolls, do not seem pertinent to the career discussion at hand. Overall, the MEMORY provides partial context but lacks clarity and direct relevance to the ongoing conversation."
