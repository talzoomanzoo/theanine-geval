    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping? Speaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp? Speaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer? Speaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures.\n2. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n3. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n4. Speaker B just moved to America and is unfamiliar with the places.\n5. Speaker A is offering advice and seems to have experience with children.\n6. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "We usually go for a camper trailer. It's more convenient with kids, especially when we bring our kitten along. It's nice to have a cozy space for everyone.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly regarding Speaker B's family camping adventures (sentence 1) and their interest in outdoor activities (sentence 2). This background complements the context of camping discussed in the conversation. Additionally, knowing that Speaker B recently moved to America and is unfamiliar with places (sentence 4) could explain potential preferences or inquiries about camping locations, aligning with the dialogue context. However, other details, such as Speaker A's frequent zoo visits and experience with children (sentences 3, 5, and 6), are not directly relevant to the ongoing dialogue about camping, even though they are naturally structured."
