Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand. Speaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  Speaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery Speaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library?  Speaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n2. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n3. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n4. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n5. Speaker A is a retired librarian who enjoys implementing creative activities in their library.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B agree on the importance of reading and the value of libraries, despite the rise of the internet.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's a shame to hear that your library is short-staffed. Libraries are such important places, and I hope the community realizes their value. Maybe you can find ways to bring in more volunteers or support from the community to help lighten the load.",
    "prediction": "1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\nHelpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It effectively captures Speaker B's interest in making the fishing trip an annual tradition, which was a topic in the dialogue. Additionally, Speaker B's enjoyment of spending time with their grandkids and taking them fishing is related to the conversation about family and leisure activities. The mention of Speaker A being busy with work aligns with the dialogue about managing work and personal life. However, the detail about Speaker A being a retired librarian implementing creative activities seems slightly inconsistent with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Speaker A mentions being busy and short-staffed at the library. Despite this, the MEMORY is fairly well-structured and provides helpful context for generating a future response, earning it a score of 4."
