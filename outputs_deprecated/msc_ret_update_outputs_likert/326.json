Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment.  Speaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n2. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n3. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n4. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n5. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue.\n6. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Definitely! Your success is inspiring. I think I might give it a try soon. Maybe I'll start with something simple like a paper crane. Thank you for offering to teach me!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful and relevant information that can help a language model generate an appropriate next response in the dialogue. Hereâ€™s why:\n\n1. Speaker A's interest and success in origami is highlighted (sentence 1), which relates well to the 3rd Place achievement mentioned in the context. This could guide Speaker B to offer encouragement about Speaker A's passion for origami.\n2. Speaker A's offer to teach Speaker B origami (sentence 4) is particularly pertinent, as it could be used by Speaker B to express enthusiasm or discuss plans for learning together, given the conversation's focus on origami.\n3. Speaker B's interest in making origami animals (sentence 6) ties directly to Speaker A's question about trying origami soon, providing a potential basis for Speaker B's response.\n\nHowever, some sentences, such as Speaker A's learning setting or specific volunteering activities, are less directly related to the immediate context but are still presented clearly and logically. Overall, MEMORY contains sentences that are naturally phrased and connected, providing useful information to generate dialog relevant to the current context. Thus, it deserves a score of 4."
