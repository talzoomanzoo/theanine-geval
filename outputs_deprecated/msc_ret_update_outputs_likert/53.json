Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. Speaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?   Speaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone. Speaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you? Speaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know. Speaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient!  Speaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends? Speaker B: No not at all but if you didn't feel comfortable talking to me I can recommend a couple of my colleagues who are just as brilliant\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n2. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n3. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n4. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n5. Speaker B is a professional in a practice, where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients.\n6. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B could pay a fee to a ranch to take care of a horse.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's really reassuring to know. Thank you for being so open to helping me. I'll definitely consider it, and maybe I'll take you up on that offer. It's good to have options.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant and helpful information about Speaker B being a therapist and having been in practice for about six years, which can offer some context when generating responses related to therapy. Additionally, Speaker B's professionalism and ethical considerations (not having relationships with clients) are crucial for the ongoing dialogue about potential therapy sessions, indicating they have boundaries which they adhere to when treating clients.\n\nHowever, several pieces of information, such as Speaker B's interest in football, do not directly contribute to the development of the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is centered around therapy and the potential for Speaker A to become a client. The mention of Speaker A's knowledge about horses and their suggestion for Speaker B to pay a ranch also do not add relevant context to the discussed topic. \n\nTherefore, while MEMORY contains relevant portions about Speaker B's professional background and considerations, additional irrelevant context dilutes its effectiveness, leading to a middle score of 3. Improvements could be made by ensuring that every sentence directly contributes to the main topic or at least provides helpful background for navigating the conversation pertaining to the potential therapist-client relationship."
