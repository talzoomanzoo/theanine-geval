Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work? Speaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol Speaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise?  Speaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows. Speaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n3. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking, mentioning setting up a hammock at their campsite.\n4. Speaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality.\n5. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n6. Speaker A plans to potentially visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That does sound peaceful and fulfilling. Being surrounded by nature all day must be so rejuvenating. And being introverted can definitely have its perks when you enjoy solitary activities like hiking. Who knows, maybe your next job could involve leading nature hikes or guiding camping trips!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several pieces of information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly regarding Speaker A's and Speaker B's interests in hiking and nature. This is helpful because it aligns with Speaker B's interest in working within the park system and Speaker A's expressed love for hiking. Additionally, MEMORY item 1 connects to the job at the grocery store mentioned in the context, suggesting a possible connection or motivation for working at that location. MEMORY item 2 also supports Speaker A's characterization as introverted, which aligns with the conversation. Most of the memory entries provide a cohesive understanding of the context and interaction between the two characters. However, some entries like item 4 and 6, while nicely phrased, are less directly tied to the progression of the immediate conversation about jobs and nature work aspirations, which is why the score is not a full 5. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured and offers contextual clues relevant to the dialogue, making it quite useful for generating an appropriate next response."
