Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. Speaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price? Speaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note.\n2. Speaker A enjoys the peace and quiet of country life, the fresh produce, and fresh air.\n3. Speaker B appreciates the convenience of city living but also values what the country has to offer.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n5. Speaker A used to live in a suburb of DC and misses the convenience of city life.\n6. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides limited helpful information for generating the next response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context involves a conversation about the purchase of a new iPhone, its high price, and its capabilities for listening to blues music and mixing music apps. The MEMORY does not contain any direct references to technology, music, or purchases, which are central to the conversation. \n\nMost of the sentences in MEMORY describe previous interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B, such as their contrasting preferences for city and country living and their participation in buying lotto tickets. While these memories indicate a general positive relationship (sentence 1) and some context about Speaker A's past environment (sentence 5), they do not provide meaningful insights or connections to the immediate conversation about the iPhone purchase and its use for music.\n\nTherefore, while sentence 1 is somewhat helpful to understand the friendly dynamic between the speakers, the other sentences do not contribute much to shaping a relevant and contextually appropriate response based on the current dialogue. The MEMORY's general nature and lack of connection to the current topic of discussion result in a lower score."
