Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha! Speaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n3. Speaker B prefers animals to humans but acknowledges the importance of curing diseases.\n4. Speaker A is scared of sharks but finds the idea of going into a steel cage with them interesting.\n5. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n6. Speaker B has experience scuba diving in Hawaii and found it to be amazing and beautiful.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I love how fascinating they are to observe. Their movements and behavior are so different from traditional pets like cats and dogs. It's like having a window into a completely different world right in my living room.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that can help Speaker B generate a proper response. Sentence 1 is directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as it confirms that Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel, which could aid in crafting a response about what Speaker B likes about them apart from being low maintenance. Sentence 2 and 3 give some background about Speaker B's general preferences and could be helpful if the conversation shifts towards discussing why Speaker B prefers snakes over other pets. Sentence 4, 5, and 6 appear less connected to the immediate context but are naturally phrased and don't impede understanding. However, they don't contribute significantly to forming a response to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, MEMORY has relevant elements, but there are also non-critical details that aren't directly linked to the current discussion."
