Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping? Speaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp? Speaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures.\n2. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n3. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n4. Speaker B is away from their child and glad that the pets are with them.\n5. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys.\n6. Speaker A is offering advice and seems to have experience with children.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I prefer tent camping for the authentic outdoor experience. It's great to disconnect from technology and enjoy nature. Do you have any favorite camping activities you like to do with your daughter?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant context that could be useful for generating a response in the ongoing dialogue. The Dialogue Context is focused on Speaker B's camping experiences and their daughter's opinions about the trip. MEMORY sentence 1 may connect to this by suggesting that Speaker B has concerns about leaving pets during such trips, though the daughter is the focus in the Context, not pets.\n\nSentence 2 indicates that Speaker B is a parent involved in activities surrounding their child's interests, which ties into the Dialogue Context where Speaker B mentions the daughter liked the camping trip. Sentence 4 may hint at past occasions where Speaker B was away from their child, which might align with the notion of camping trips.\n\nHowever, other MEMORY details, such as Speaker A's regular visits to the zoo (sentence 5) or offering advice (sentence 6), don't directly connect to the Dialogue Context about camping. While these details are naturally phrased and informative about each speaker's experiences, they lack direct connectivity to the ongoing dialogue.\n\nThus, the MEMORY contains useful parts but could further focus on relevant past interactions or details to enhance connectivity and relevance to the Dialogue Context."
