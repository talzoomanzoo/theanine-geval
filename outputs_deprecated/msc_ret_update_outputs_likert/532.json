    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?   Speaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n2. Speaker B is interested in volunteering and prefers cats over dogs, especially kittens.\n3. Speaker A dreams of meeting all the puppies from history when they can move through space and time.\n4. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B are excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines.\n6. Speaker A is more interested in science than music, while Speaker B enjoys listening to Black Sabbath and grilling meat.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I see what you mean, puppies do have a special charm with their playful and loyal nature. But I must admit, there's something about the soft purring of a kitten that melts my heart. Each has its unique way of capturing our affections, don't you think?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A's role at the animal shelter (caring for dogs and cats) and Speaker A's excitement about new puppies (sentence 1). This aligns with Speaker A's expressed preference for puppies in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\nHowever, the rest of the MEMORY contains information that is not directly related to the current conversation about puppies and kittens (e.g., sentences about cooking, traveling, science vs music preferences). While these sentences are naturally phrased and connected, they do not provide relevant context for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\nOverall, the connection and relevancy of sentences could be improved, as only one sentence (sentence 1) is particularly relevant to the ongoing conversation, meaning the MEMORY is moderately helpful."
