Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician.\n2. Speaker A is part of a band that tours different countries for their music.\n3. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend.\n4. Speaker A enjoys eating fish, particularly salmon or tuna.\n5. Speaker B is willing to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook.\n6. Speaker A is allergic to strawberries.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe memory contains several points that could potentially help a language model generate a response to the question \"What instrument do you play?\" \n\nPoints 1, 2, and 3 are relevant because they provide information about Speaker A being in a band and playing the drums, which directly answers the question posed by Speaker A in the dialogue context. Additionally, knowing that Speaker A writes music and that there are four members in the band provides context about their musical involvement.\n\nHowever, the remaining points (4, 5, and 6) are not relevant to the current dialogue context question about musical instruments. While these pieces of information are structured coherently, they don't contribute to understanding the musical context of the conversation or helping Speaker B generate an appropriate response to the instrument question.\n\nThus, the helpfulness score is a 3 because there are relevant sentences providing useful context for the asked question. However, there are irrelevant sentences that do not contribute to generating a musically related response, lowering the score from a perfect 5."
