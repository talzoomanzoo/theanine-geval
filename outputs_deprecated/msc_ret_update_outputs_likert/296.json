Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods. Speaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and their brother enjoy going to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner.\n2. Speaker A's brother enjoys Brazilian food, specifically steak.\n3. Speaker A enjoys salsa dancing and is planning to go out dancing.\n4. Speaker A is planning to take their clients salsa dancing for fun.\n5. Speaker B works as a bartender and enjoys meeting different people.\n6. Speaker B's family enjoys dancing on the boat at night under the stars.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's an action-packed movie about the Marvel character Black Widow. We loved the mix of adrenaline and great storytelling.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Points 1 and 2 mention Speaker A's and their brother's interest in Brazilian food, which is directly relevant to the conversation where Speaker A mentions enjoying Brazilian foods. However, the other points (3, 4, 5, and 6) are not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and primarily focus on dancing and Speaker B's job and family's interest, which do not have a direct causal or contextual connection to the movie or Brazilian food discussion. This makes MEMORY somewhat helpful but not fully optimized for assisting in generating a specific follow-up response connected to the dialogue. The sentences are naturally structured, providing additional context regarding speaker interactions, but only a part of the MEMORY is directly connected to the dialogue."
