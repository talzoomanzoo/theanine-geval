Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing? Speaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from? Speaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there. Speaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n2. Speaker A prefers adopting pets from shelters rather than from breeders.\n3. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets.\n4. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy the company of their pets and think they are smart and playful.\n5. Speaker B has 5 dogs of different breeds and has rats as pets but didn't include them in the portrait.\n6. Speaker B thinks pit bulls are lovely and has one that is kind and sweet.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I agree, cats are definitely more independent than dogs. I'm thinking of naming my new cat Luna. It's great to hear that your pets are doing well and that you enjoy painting them in your portraits. Your great dane and pet rat portrait sounds like it will be adorable!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains relevant and contextual information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, memory item 2 directly correlates to Speaker A's intention in the dialogue to adopt a new cat from a shelter. Memory item 5 relates to Speaker B's comment in the dialogue about having many pets and their associated struggles with saying no. Item 6, though not directly mentioned in the dialogue, matches the sentiment of the conversation regarding pets, fostering a sense of Speaker B's affection for animals. The remaining memory items provide detailed background information on both speakers' preferences and interests related to pets and art, aiding in creating a well-rounded personality for both speakers. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured and paraphrased in a way that connects to and enhances the dialogue context, making it more useful for generating a coherent and contextually appropriate next response. However, not all sentences directly impact generating the next response, which is why it does not achieve a perfect score of 5."
