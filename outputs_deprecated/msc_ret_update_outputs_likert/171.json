Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me? Speaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week? Speaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day Speaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through Speaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested. Speaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round. Speaker A: I would definitely recommend looking for a rental car to have on hand. There is a town within walking distance from me, but it can be dangerous to walk with the wolves and elk around, especially at night.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n2. Speaker A suggests going on hikes in Alaska to see wildlife and mentions glaciers as a potential attraction.\n3. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n4. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\n5. Speaker A has visited Alaska and describes it as beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage.\n6. Speaker A mentioned the wildlife, including elk and wolves.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "That makes sense. I'll look into renting a car then. I wouldn't want to run into any wolves or elk unexpectedly. It sounds like having a car will give us more flexibility to explore safely.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information for generating a proper response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory captures key details such as Speaker B planning to visit Speaker A, interest in concerts and outdoor activities, and Speaker A's recommendations for wildlife tours and folk concerts, which align with the conversation. The memory also accurately reflects Speaker A's excitement about the visit and concern about the local wildlife, relevant for creating a coherent and contextually appropriate response. However, there are a few inconsistencies, such as \"petting a wolf\" and details about Alaska that were not mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which slightly diminishes its helpfulness. Despite these minor discrepancies, the sentences are naturally structured and provide a clear picture of the interaction between the speakers."
