Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think? Speaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n2. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n3. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n4. Speaker B enjoys fishing and wishes their wife and sons could have joined them on the trip.\n5. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B have a conversation about their personal interests and trips they have taken for work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a beautiful idea! Your wife and sons would be touched by such a thoughtful gesture. It's amazing how tattoos can hold so much meaning and tell a story.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker A enjoys tattoos and already has a tattoo dedicated to their late father (memory 1), which directly relates to Speaker A's intention in the dialogue. Memories 2 and 3 are also beneficial as they further explain Speaker A's tattoo plans and context about their life (working at a coffee shop and saving up for a tattoo), providing additional depth to Speaker A's character. Memory 5 reveals a connection between Speaker A's work and their mom, which might be relevant or interesting to include, given the context of the tattoo being for their mom. However, memories 4 and 6 are unrelated to the current dialogue context, as they focus on Speaker B's interests and work-related trips, which do not add any immediate value to the conversation about tattoos. Nevertheless, overall, the MEMORY includes relevant and naturally structured information that helps understand Speaker A's motivations and aids in generating a context-appropriate response."
