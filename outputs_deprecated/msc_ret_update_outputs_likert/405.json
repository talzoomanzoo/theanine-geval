    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n2. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n3. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n4. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n5. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n6. Speaker A enjoys watching Jeopardy with their grandchildren and cooking for them, with the busiest time being the weekend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: While the MEMORY contains several pieces of information about Speaker A's relationship with their grandchildren, it lacks direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT concerning Speaker A's interest in crime dramas and their conversation with Speaker B about book preferences. The memory mentions watching grandchildren, Netflix preferences, and some interests of Speaker B, but these details do not contribute significantly to generating a suitable response for Speaker B in the current context of discussing book genres. The memory lacks connections or developments that align with the ongoing topic of fiction preferences, thus limiting its helpfulness to Speaker B's response generation."
