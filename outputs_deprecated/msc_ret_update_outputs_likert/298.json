Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods. Speaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about? Speaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America. Have you seen any of those movies? Speaker B: No I haven't seen any of those. What foods did you eat while watching the movie?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and their brother enjoy going to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner.\n2. Speaker A's brother enjoys Brazilian food, specifically steak.\n3. Speaker A enjoys salsa dancing and is planning to go out dancing.\n4. Speaker B works as a bartender and enjoys meeting different people.\n5. Speaker B expressed interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A.\n6. Speaker A is planning to take their clients salsa dancing for fun.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "We had delicious Brazilian steak and some traditional side dishes like feijoada and pão de queijo. It was a perfect dinner before hitting the dance floor for some salsa!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be useful in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, memories 1 and 2 about Speaker A and their brother enjoying Brazilian foods are directly relevant to Speaker B's questions about the foods they ate. However, other elements in the MEMORY, like Speaker A’s affection for salsa dancing and Speaker B's work as a bartender, are unrelated to the present dialogue about movies and dinner. The information is structured and naturally connected; however, the lack of specific connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT prevents it from being rated higher. Therefore, while useful, the MEMORY isn't fully aligned with the present conversational context, and thus earns a score of 3."
