Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. Speaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n2. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n3. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n4. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n5. Speaker B is a professional in a practice, where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients.\n6. Speaker A is married and has been for four years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "No, I've never been to therapy, but I can imagine how beneficial it could be. I usually find solace in spending time with my horses. They're great listeners, even if they can't talk back!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a proper response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly due to the following points:\n\n1. The first memory point mentions that Speaker B is a therapist, which aligns with the conversation topic of Speaker B discussing their experiences and passion for therapy. This connection is directly relevant to the dialogue context.\n\n2. Information that Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years offers additional context regarding their experience level, which is pertinent when discussing their career and satisfaction in it.\n\n3. The fact that Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology isn't immediately relevant to this part of the conversation but can be useful for future interactions involving psychological discussions.\n\n4. Other details, like Speaker B supporting the Chiefs and considering Freudian theories, are less relevant to the immediate context but add depth to Speaker B's character.\n\n5. Knowing Speaker A is married gives a bit of personal context that could be relevant in other, more personal conversations.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY contains relevant information naturally connected to past interactions, especially memory points 1 and 3, which are crucial for the ongoing discussion about being a therapist. Other points offer depth but are less immediately connected to the dialogue context. Therefore, it deserves a solid score of 4."
