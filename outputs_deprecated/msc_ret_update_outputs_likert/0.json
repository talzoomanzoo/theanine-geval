Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n2. Speaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\n3. Speaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\n4. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n5. Speaker B's new car is black, and it is their first new car after driving pre-owned cars before.\n6. Speaker A is older and mentions having blue hair already.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "No, I actually decided to drive instead of flying. I received a new car from my mom, so I'm excited to take it on a road trip during spring break.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some contextual information that could potentially aid the language model in generating a response. Here is a breakdown:\n\n1. The note that Speaker B is going on a trip is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about purchasing plane tickets. However, it does not specify if Speaker B is flying or driving for their trip, which might be helpful.\n2. The memory lacks connection between Speaker B's trip and whether or not they have indeed purchased plane tickets, which is central to the query in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n3. Details about Speaker B's car might indicate they plan to drive, but this inference is incomplete without a direct statement regarding the plane tickets.\n4. The memory contains some potentially useful information about Speaker A and B's preferences and past behaviors (e.g., contrasting spring break activities, car information) that could shape the interaction's tone, even if they are not directly about the query.\n5. Context about gas mileage and Speaker A's age and hair color do not directly address the question about plane tickets and are less relevant to the immediate context of the dialogue.\n\nOverall, while there are some tangentially relevant details, the MEMORY does not clearly connect with the question about plane tickets, making it less helpful for generating a direct response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
