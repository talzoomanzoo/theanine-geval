Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation. Speaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon? Speaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch?  Speaker B: There is a horror genre movie that was released just this week which I'm going to watch tonight. It is called \"Girl Next.\" Speaker A: Oh that sounds interesting, I will look into that and put it on my list. How has your job been going? Is there where you get all these great ideas for what to watch?   Speaker B: My Film Studies professor job has been going absolutely great lately. I love all my students, because they really get into the lectures and ask lots of questions. Yes, my job requires me to watch movies all the time, so that is how I find the best ones. Is your programmer job going all right lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences.\n2. Speaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman.\n3. Speaker B used to teach Film Studies and carefully chooses what movies to watch.\n4.

    "raw_prediction": "That's fantastic to hear about your Film Studies professor job! It must be so fulfilling to share your passion with eager students. My programmer job is going well, thank you for asking. It's always interesting to hear about your movie recommendations and how your job influences them.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clearly states that Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations (Memory 1), which aligns with Speaker B's recommendation of \"Pulp Fiction\" in the dialogue context. Moreover, it mentions that Speaker B used to teach Film Studies and watches movies regularly (Memory 3), which connects to Speaker B's explanation of getting movie ideas from their job. Memories 2, 4, and 5 give insights into both speakers' movie preferences, which is useful for understanding their discussions about movies. Memory 4 particularly ties into the genres of movies Speaker B might recommend, which could include the horror genre mentioned as \"Girl Next.\" However, Memory 6 about Speaker A enjoying \"Coming to America\" isn't directly linked to the ongoing dialogue, as it covers future watching plans not yet realized in the context. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured, providing a clear understanding of Speaker B's role as a movie recommender and context for their interactions."
