Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes? Speaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try? Speaker B: I mean I always recommend Karate since that's what I study! I can bring you by the dojo sometime if you want to see what it is like.  Speaker A: OMG!! That would be so awesome, Yes please.  When is a good time for you? Speaker B: Awesome! Tomorrow afternoon anytime between 3-6 would work for me!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate.\n2. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.\n3. Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both have interests in learning new languages.\n5. Speaker B enjoys water-related activities and movies like \"Jaws\".\n6. Speaker A is taking a French class and plans to learn French to dig for clams in Quebec.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information about Speaker B's background in karate and football, which can provide useful context to the Dialogue Context about Speaker B's knowledge and recommendations for martial arts. The information about Speaker B's involvement in karate (having a green belt and considering karate footwork) aligns with the topic of martial arts classes in the dialogue. Also, the mention of Speaker B's intention of going back to school and having IT interests might hint at Speaker B's diverse interests, which, while not directly related to the current dialogue, enriches the characterization.\n\nHowever, some sentences in the MEMORY such as Speaker A taking a French class or enjoying water-related activities are not directly relevant to the immediate context of discussing martial arts classes and arranging a visit to the dojo. These sentences do provide some context to Speaker A's and B's personalities but do not enhance the immediate conversation surrounding karate recommendations or schedule arrangements directly.\n\nOverall, while there are useful details, the MEMORY is not consistently aligned with the specific flow and focus of the given Dialogue Context, thus earning a middle-range score."
