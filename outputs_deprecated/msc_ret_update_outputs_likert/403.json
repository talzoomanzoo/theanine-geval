Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n2. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n3. Speaker A enjoys watching Jeopardy with their grandchildren and cooking for them, with the busiest time being the weekend.\n4. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n5. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n6. Speaker A suggests taking naps during quiet times and mentions watching her grandkids.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a thrilling read! It's great that you're enjoying it. Sometimes a good book can be the perfect escape, especially after spending time with the grandkids.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker A, particularly about their relationship with their grandchildren and how they spend time together. This helps to contextualize why Speaker A might have more free time to read, as mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, it doesn't provide much information that directly relates to the current conversation about the book they're reading or the excitement of the activity. Some sentences do connect to the current context, such as Speaker A enjoying activities without the grandchildren, but others (like preferences for Netflix shows) don't add much value to the conversation. Overall, the MEMORY provides a moderate level of helpfulness with some relevant context, but lacks specific ties to the current book discussion."
