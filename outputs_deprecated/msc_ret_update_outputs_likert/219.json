Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid.\n2. Speaker A's friend found two baby raccoons in her yard, one of which was given to Speaker A to keep as a pet.\n3. Speaker A is not interested in going on a cruise and would prefer camping as a vacation.\n4. Speaker A does not play music for the animals at the zoo to keep them calm.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for music and plan to have a house concert with their pets.\n6. Speaker B asks Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information, particularly the first sentence, which is directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as it establishes that Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey, which is relevant to the situation where Journey ate a piece of pizza. This memory about Journey being one of Speaker A's pets can assist the language model in forming a more informed response. \n\nHowever, the other sentences in the MEMORY are not very helpful for the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT provided. While some of them provide background information, such as about Speaker A's friend giving them a raccoon and additional preferences and interests of Speaker A, they do not directly aid in generating a response to the question Speaker B asked about how Speaker A prevents Journey from eating food. \n\nThough not all sentences are directly related to the current conversation, they are generally structured in a coherent manner, representing some past interactions and personal context that might be relevant in other conversations between the speakers. Nevertheless, due to limited direct relevance to the specific issue being discussed, the MEMORY earns a midway score."
