Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week? Speaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you? Speaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions? Speaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n3. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n4. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n5. Speaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy playing video games in their free time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I prefer more relaxed games like Jurassic Park: World. I like the adventure and exploration aspect of it. It's just more my speed compared to the intense horror of Resident Evil.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that can be helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically:\n\n- Point 1 about Resident Evil being scary is somewhat relevant, as it aligns with Speaker A's expressed feelings about not liking scary video games.\n- Point 3 touches on Speaker B's interest in similar games, which aligns with their dialogue about enjoying games like Resident Evil.\n- Points 4 and 5 provide insight into Speaker A's preferences for tamer, non-scary games, which ties into the current conversation about not knowing what to play next.\n- However, Point 2 about playing games together and Speaker A trying Resident Evil seems less relevant in this context as it doesn't directly relate to the conversation.\n- Overall, the MEMORY provides a general sense of both speakers' gaming preferences, which is useful, but it lacks depth in points directly related to the current dialogue exchange.\n\nThe MEMORY could be improved by having more details directly related to the current query of game suggestions, for instance, more specific information regarding non-scary games that Speaker B might know due to Speaker A's preferences."
