Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n2. Speaker B is interested in volunteering and prefers cats over dogs, especially kittens.\n3. Speaker A dreams of meeting all the puppies from history when they can move through space and time.\n4. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters.\n5. Speaker A is more interested in science than music, while Speaker B enjoys listening to Black Sabbath and grilling meat.\n6. Speaker A has experience working night shifts and sees it as a drawback.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I can't wait to come by and meet the new cat! I adore kittens, but I have to agree, puppies are just so irresistible with their playful energy.",
    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information that could be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly in understanding the speakers' interests and preferences regarding animals. The first memory point is relevant as it highlights Speaker Aâ€™s care for both dogs and cats at the shelter, aligning with the dialogue context where Speaker A talks about a new cat arriving at the shelter. However, other sentences about Speaker A's dreams, cooking preferences, and night shifts, as well as Speaker B's music preferences, are less relevant to this context. The sentences are naturally structured, but they do not clearly demonstrate the causal or developmental interactions between the speakers. Some information about volunteering and animal preferences could be useful for generating a response, but other details feel disconnected from the immediate context. Thus, the MEMORY is moderately helpful."
