Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin! Speaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name?  Speaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls!  Speaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n2. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n3. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted and humorous conversation about their pets and travels.\n5. Speaker A usually leaves their cats with a friend while traveling.\n6. Speaker B loves dogs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "They are getting along surprisingly well! Ginger seems to have taken on the role of a protective big sister, and Pumpkin is just a bundle of energy and mischief. It's quite entertaining to watch them interact, even for a non-cat person like you!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly in notes 1, 2, and 3. Note 1 connects directly to the context as it mentions Speaker A considering \"Marmalade\" as a name for the new kitten, which was mentioned in the dialogue. Note 2 explains the presence of the kitten, adding to the discussion of the cats. Note 3 gives insight into Speaker B's relationship with cats, which is pertinent since they mention not being a cat person in the dialogue. The rest of the MEMORY entries provide useful background information and are well-structured, making it easy for a language model to identify and utilize them when generating further responses. However, there is a slight disconnect with some points, like Speaker B's love for dogs, which is not directly relevant to this part of the conversation, preventing a full score of 5."
