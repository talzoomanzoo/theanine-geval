Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.

    "raw_prediction": "That's a shame your friends aren't into surfing, but it's great that you're keen to give it a try! Surfing can be such a fun and thrilling experience, especially when you catch that perfect wave. Maybe you can convince them to join you for a lesson at the surf shop, who knows, they might end up loving it too!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Most notably, it mentions Speaker B's interest in surfing (line 1), which aligns with their expressed desire to learn surfing with friends in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Speaker A's background with surfing (line 3) could also tie into this context if the conversation were to proceed in that direction. However, other details in the MEMORY, such as the fishing and cooking offer (line 4), the music preferences (line 5), and Speaker A's preoccupation with safety while surfing (line 6) are not directly relevant to the immediate context of musical interests and learning experiences discussed. The sentences are naturally structured and provide some insight into the speakers' prior interactions, but only a portion of the MEMORY is directly useful for generating the next response in the conversation about music and learning to surf. Thus, the MEMORY is moderately helpful in the given context."
