Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar. Speaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n2. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n3. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n4. Speaker A is eating their favorite jello.\n5. Speaker B also enjoys jello, with cherry being their favorite flavor as well.\n6. Speaker B does not do a lot of cooking or baking but is interested in learning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Desserts in general. I have a sweet tooth, and it's been hard to resist my favorite cherry jello lately. But I suppose a little indulgence every now and then won't hurt!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could aid in generating a response. For example, points 1 and 3 indicate that Speaker A has a strong connection to jello due to their grandmother, which mirrors Speaker B's situation of passing on a jello recipe. This could provide a basis for a shared experience or empathy in a future response. Point 5 shows a shared interest in cherry-flavored jello, something that could be brought up in a conversation about flavor preferences or family recipes.\n\nHowever, many of the MEMORY points are not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT or are not fully developed to establish a clear past interaction. Point 2 about Speaker A suggesting a surrogate grandmother doesn't directly connect with the current conversation, neither does point 4 where Speaker A is eating their favorite jello.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY includes some relevant pieces of information, it lacks strong connections or developments that would make it clear and directly beneficial for continuing the conversation, hence the score of 3."
