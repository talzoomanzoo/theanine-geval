Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments.\n2. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n3. Speaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\n4. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n5. Speaker A has children and grandchildren, with at least one child interested in learning the flute.\n6. Speaker A's other children are addicted to tablets and phones, unlike the youngest one who is interested in music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Oh, yes, I do use text messaging to keep in touch with my grandkids. It's a convenient way to stay connected with them, especially when they're so caught up with their phones and tablets all the time.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful context regarding Speaker B's relationship with their grandkids, which is directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT question about using technology like text messaging to interact with them. Sentences 1, 2, and 4 provide specific details about Speaker B's interactions with their grandkids, which could help Speaker B generate a response about the use of technology in communication. Sentence 3 establishes that Speaker B's grandkids are older, suggesting they likely use technology, which is useful for answering the question about text messaging. The MEMORY contains natural and logically connected sentences that give a sense of Speaker B's family context and interests, enabling a language model to easily differentiate relevant details. Overall, the MEMORY is coherent and provides beneficial information, although not all details are directly tied to the question of interactive technologies."
