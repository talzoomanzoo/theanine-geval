Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes? Speaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try? Speaker B: I mean I always recommend Karate since that's what I study! I can bring you by the dojo sometime if you want to see what it is like.  Speaker A: OMG!! That would be so awesome, Yes please.  When is a good time for you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate.\n2. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.\n3. Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both have interests in learning new languages.\n5. Speaker A is taking a French class and plans to learn French to dig for clams in Quebec.\n6. Speaker B enjoys water-related activities and movies like \"Jaws\".\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that could potentially inform a language model generating responses for Speaker B. Specifically, memories about Speaker B's background in football and karate, as mentioned in points 1 and 3, are somewhat helpful as they relate to the martial arts context of the conversation. However, much of the MEMORY, including Speaker B considering IT work, enjoying water-related activities and movies, and Speaker A's language learning, is not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Furthermore, while there are some connections between the memories and the conversation (e.g., football helping with karate footwork), the development of these connections is not sufficiently clear or detailed to provide strong causal or relational cues for the model's response generation. The MEMORY overall lacks comprehensive linkage between past interactions and the current context, limiting its helpfulness."
