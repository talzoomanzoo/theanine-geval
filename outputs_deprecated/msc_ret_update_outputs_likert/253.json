Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you? Speaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses. Speaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n2. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.\n3. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n4. Speaker B has a government job that pays the bills but wishes they could work in interior design.\n5. Speaker A prefers classic horror movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th over modern ones.\n6. Speaker A has recently received a call for a job interview and is excited about it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Oh, the stories from the set are endless! One time, my dad and I were brainstorming for a new movie idea, and we ended up scaring ourselves so much that we had to keep the lights on all night. It was both thrilling and hilarious at the same time.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains a mix of helpful and less helpful information in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 4 provide relevant background on Speaker B's involvement in horror movie production and their thoughts on interior design, directly aligning with the topics discussed by Speaker B in the dialogue context. Sentence 1 offers valuable context about Speaker B's creative process with their dad, which could help in generating a future response about fascinating stories from the set, as asked by Speaker A. Sentence 4 provides background on Speaker B's current situation and thoughts about a potential career in interior design. \n\nHowever, sentences 2, 3, 5, and 6 are less relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These sentences primarily focus on Speaker A's preferences and situations, which do not directly contribute to Speaker B's ability to generate a continuation in the dialogue about their horror movie-making experiences or determine if interior design is not a good fit, as mentioned in the context.\n\nOverall, MEMORY is somewhat helpful but does not fully satisfy all aspects of relevance and natural connection to the dialogue context, resulting in a mid-range score."
