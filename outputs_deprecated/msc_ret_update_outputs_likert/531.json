Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?  \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n2. Speaker B is interested in volunteering and prefers cats over dogs, especially kittens.\n3. Speaker A dreams of meeting all the puppies from history when they can move through space and time.\n4. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B are excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines.\n6. Speaker A is more interested in science than music, while Speaker B enjoys listening to Black Sabbath and grilling meat.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Puppies just have this playful energy and innocence that I find absolutely irresistible. They bring so much joy and excitement to the shelter! But don't get me wrong, kittens are adorable too. Each animal has its own unique charm.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information regarding Speaker A and their interest in puppies, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they express preference for puppies over cats. Specifically, memory point 1 offers useful context about Speaker A's role in the animal shelter and their fondness for puppies, which helps explain why they might think puppies are cuter than kittens. Additionally, memory point 2 provides insight into Speaker B's preference, indicating why they might question the difference between kittens and puppies.\n\nHowever, the other memory points (3, 4, 5, 6) are not directly related to the current dialogue about kittens and puppies and do not provide any additional explanatory context or knowledge that could aid in generating a response pertaining to this specific topic. While they are naturally structured and may be relevant in different conversational contexts, they do not directly contribute to this interaction about puppies and kittens.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is moderately helpful, with some relevant information to aid Speaker A in crafting an informed response, but it contains several points that are not directly relevant to the topic at hand."
