Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food? Speaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too? Speaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also? Speaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways? Speaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy? Speaker A: I think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature.\n2. Speaker B has elderly terriers and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one.\n3. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid.\n4. Speaker A works at a zoo and is willing to help Speaker B get an entry-level position there.\n5. Speaker A mentions that entry-level positions at the zoo involve cleaning enclosures and feeding less dangerous animals but offer decent pay, training, benefits, and assistance with schooling.\n6. Speaker A works at a zoo and has tried playing music for the white tigers and home concerts for their pets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, it was the warehouse job. I just felt like I needed a change of pace before starting something new. And yes, caring for elderly pets definitely requires more time and attention. How did you end up working at the zoo in the first place?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several useful pieces of information that relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It accurately captures important details about Speaker A's pets, Journey and Sid, which directly ties into the conversation about dealing with pets and their behavior. It also mentions Speaker A's job at the zoo, which connects to the topic in the context where Speaker A notes that working at the zoo has possibly helped in managing their pets. Furthermore, it provides pertinent details about Speaker B's situation, such as having elderly terriers and leaving a part-time job, which indirectly relates to their availability to spend more time with their pets as mentioned in the dialogue. While some of the information in MEMORY (e.g., Speaker B planning to leave their part-time job, Speaker A suggesting entry-level positions at the zoo) is not mentioned explicitly in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it is naturally phrased and structured in a way that could help create coherent and contextually relevant responses. However, some parts of the MEMORY, like playing music for white tigers and home concerts, are disconnected from the main flow of the dialogue, which slightly detracts from its utility. Overall, MEMORY provides a well-connected background that aids in generating a suitable response in the given dialogue context."
