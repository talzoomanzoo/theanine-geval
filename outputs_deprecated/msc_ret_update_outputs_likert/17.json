Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim.  Speaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you  Speaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. Speaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you? Speaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it. Speaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n2. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n3. Speaker A plans to travel to the Caribbean for their next trip.\n4. Speaker A enjoys the food and the adventure of cruises.\n5. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n6. Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and has signed up for several trips.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've always wanted to explore New Orleans. The music scene there is incredible, and I've heard the food is amazing. It would be a great stop on a cruise trip.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides a mix of helpful and less relevant information for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Helpful elements include:\n\n- Sentence 1 mentions the potential of getting on a cruise ship together, which aligns with Speaker B's interest in joining Speaker A on a future cruise.\n- Sentence 3, which notes Speaker A's plans to travel to the Caribbean, ties into the conversation about traveling and cruising, providing context for Speaker A's excitement.\n\nHowever, several sentences are less connected to the current dialogue:\n\n- Sentence 2 inaccurately suggests that Speaker B wants to listen to punk music while swimming and programming, whereas the context only mentions a playlist created by Speaker A.\n- Sentence 4 about Speaker A enjoying food and the adventure of cruises doesn't directly connect with the present conversation.\n- Sentence 5 incorporates programming, which isn't a focus in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT where swimming is the subject.\n- Sentence 6 about a snorkeling trip seems to add additional but unrelated information to the context.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY could benefit from clearer causality and connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it isn't entirely without helpful elements."
