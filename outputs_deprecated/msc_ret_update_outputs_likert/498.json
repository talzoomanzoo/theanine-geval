Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. Speaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n3. Speaker A used to live in a suburb of DC and misses the convenience of city life.\n4. Speaker B appreciates the convenience of city living but also values what the country has to offer.\n5. Speaker A enjoys the peace and quiet of country life, the fresh produce, and fresh air.\n6. Speaker B is open to moving to the country to be further away from neighbors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I absolutely love all the features and how smooth it runs. It's just that the price tag was a bit hard to swallow. But overall, I'm really happy with it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several individual pieces of information about past interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B, such as shared activities (buying lotto tickets) and their opinions on city and country living. However, none of these memories are directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on Speaker A's recent purchase of a new iPhone and concerns about its cost. While the memories are somewhat helpful in establishing the general nature of the relationship and interests of the two speakers, they do not directly aid in generating a response to Speaker B's question about Speaker A's satisfaction with the iPhone beyond the price issue. The memories lack a clear development or causal relationship relevant to the current topic, thus limiting their helpfulness to the dialogue context."
