Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that? Speaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading? Speaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha. Speaker B: Well if it's any good I know you'll be watching the whole thing. Speaker A: you know it.  And I know that you would just fall asleep during it whether it's any good or not. Speaker B: Is there a lot of violence in your book? I couldn't stand to read it if there was. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n2. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n3. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n4. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n5. Speaker A suggests taking naps during quiet times and mentions watching her grandkids.\n6. Speaker A was influenced by Alex Trebek and Ken Jennings to develop a love for books and reading.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "There are some intense scenes, but nothing too graphic. It's more about the mystery and suspense rather than violence. I think you might actually enjoy this one!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The memory provides some useful context that enriches the dialogue. For instance, Memory 4 and Memory 3 both mention Speaker A's grandchildren, which is referenced at the beginning of the dialogue when Speaker A states they didn't watch their grandkids that day. This helps to link past interactions to the current conversation. Memory 2 connects Speaker B's interest in animals with their preference for animal books mentioned in the dialogue. However, Memory 1 and Memory 6 do not specifically relate to the ongoing book and media discussion, making them less valuable in generating the next response. The memories are generally well-phrased and provide some context that is relevant to the discussion. Therefore, the score is a 3 because while there are connections and helpful cues, additional or more directly relevant information could have been beneficial for generating a response."
