Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand. Speaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  Speaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery Speaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n2. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n3. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n4. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments.\n5. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n6. Speaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant background information about the interaction between Speaker A and Speaker B. It clearly demonstrates Speaker B's interest in spending time with their grandkids and fostering their interest in nature, which ties directly into the dialogue context about planning an annual fishing trip. Furthermore, the mention of Speaker B's grandkids being more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments indirectly emphasizes the importance of such trips for engaging them with nature. Additionally, Speaker A's situation of being busy with work resonates with the context of having difficulty staying in touch, aligning with the dialogue's mention of text messaging. Consequently, the MEMORY contains useful and well-connected information that aids in generating a meaningful continuation of the dialogue. However, not all details directly contribute to the ongoing conversation, preventing a perfect score."
