    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok?  Speaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish? Speaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus! Speaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well? Speaker A: Yes, I am thinking about trying either the new eclairs, or their tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle! I have too many good options to pick from! What one would you pick? Speaker B: Hands down, I would pick the tres leches. Ever since I tried it a few years ago, it has always been my favorite dessert. Speaker A: Okay, I will try that! I've heard the can be made with different fruits. Did you have fruit with yours? Speaker B: I like it best with fresh strawberries. And then it is even better with some fresh whipped cream and chocolate drizzle. Just thinking about it is making me want to have some right now! Speaker A: Ooh, that sounds delicious! It's a rich and moist cake, so I don't think it should have too much chocolate. I've seen brown sugar and caramel versions too! Speaker B: Oh I've never seen that version. That sounds scrumptuous. Tonight I'm going to bake some oatmeal raisin cookies. Speaker A: That sounds great! I love a good oatmeal raisin cookie with the right amount of cinnamon! My brothers don't like them though, haha. They call them the \"vegetable of cookies\" :)\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n2. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n3. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n4. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n5. Speaker A's restaurant plays a mix of songs, mainly easy listening, to create a relaxing environment for diners.\n6. Speaker A is an omnivore.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful background information about Speaker A working at a restaurant, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A shares excitement about a new menu item. However, many memory items are not directly helpful for generating the next response. For example, details about the beach, Mediterranean food, and the restaurant's playlist are not relevant to the immediate context of discussing dishes and desserts at A's workplace. The connection between MEMORY and DIALOGUE CONTEXT is weak, lacking development in past interactions that could enhance the generation of the next response. Also, there is duplication, which does not add value to understanding (e.g., Speaker A working at a restaurant is mentioned multiple times). The MEMORY could be more helpful if the details directly related to the current conversational topic were more pronounced."
