Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin! Speaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name?  Speaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls!  Speaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well? Speaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens. Speaker B: hehe you're right. But i can't explain that why I am not a cat person to you sorry. How's the weather like today, still good weather to have iced tea out there? Speaker A: It's beautiful. I'm sitting outside while the Spice Girls are chasing bugs in the grass. What did your kids name your cats? Speaker B: ohh so nice sounds like you are enjoying the weather. Still we are discussing about that. Did not name them yet. Also I want to put them back since I am not a big fan of cat Speaker A: That would be cruel to do. You need to rehome them properly or otherwise someone may report you to the authorities for animal abuse. My heart is breaking for your poor cats.  Speaker B: Thank you for concerning. I am trying to be nice to them do not worry  Speaker A: They all have their own unique personalities and maybe you will enjoy them more once you get to know them better. I think of Pumpkin and Ginger as my children and I am sure you would never consider abandoning your children. Ginger is going for surgery to make sure she has no more babies. Im worried that she may be in pain afterwards.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n2. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n3. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n4. Speaker A usually leaves their cats with a friend while traveling.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted and humorous conversation about their pets and travels.\n6. Speaker B loves dogs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You're right, each cat has its own charm and quirks that make them special. I'm sure your care and attention will help them feel safe and loved. Ginger will be in good hands after the surgery, and I hope she recovers quickly without much discomfort.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it mentions that Speaker A has a cat named Ginger and that they were considering naming a new kitten Marmalade, which aligns with Speaker A's decision to change the kitten's name to Pumpkin, mentioned in the dialogue. It also indicates that Speaker B is not a cat person but takes care of stray cats, which connects to the dialogue about Speaker B's reluctance to keep the cats and Speaker A's advice against abandoning them. \n\nHowever, certain elements in the MEMORY, such as Speaker A usually leaving their cats with a friend while traveling and Speaker B loving dogs, do not directly relate to the conversation's current direction and are not particularly helpful for generating the next response. Also, the memory does not contain sentences that distinctly demonstrate the development or causality of events between the speakers. \n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides some useful information but lacks a clear demonstration of the progression or connection of events needed for a higher score."
