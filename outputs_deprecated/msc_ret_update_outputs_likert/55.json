Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n2. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks.\n3. Speaker A recommends the new album by Highly Suspect to Speaker B.\n4. Speaker A is a fan of the Game of Thrones series and enjoys audiobooks.\n5. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n6. Speaker A asks about Speaker B's new artwork and acknowledges their need for inspiration.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds amazing! Nature walks always inspire me. Did you come across anything that caught your eye for your artwork?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains relevant details about Speaker B's love for nature and nature walks (sentence 1) and their inspiration for artwork during nature walks (sentence 2), which directly connects to Speaker A's statement about the nature walk. Additionally, sentence 6 mentions Speaker A's acknowledgment of Speaker B's need for inspiration, which aligns well with the context. While some sentences (3, 4, and 5) are less directly related to the nature theme, they are naturally phrased and provide background information about the speakers. The sentences are overall well-structured, demonstrating clear connections and relevance to the dialogue context."
