Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok?  Speaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n2. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n3. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n4. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n5. Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n6. Speaker A enjoys the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's called Mediterranean Grilled Sea Bass. I heard the chef talking about how they marinate it in olive oil, garlic, and herbs for hours before grilling it to perfection. I'll make sure to send you a picture once it's ready!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a fairly helpful backdrop for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It offers relevant details such as Speaker A's job at the restaurant, where they could try the dish for free (memory points 1, 2, 3). These points are directly related to the excitement Speaker A expresses in the context. Memory point 3 specifically aligns with Speaker A's anticipation of trying the dish for free. Moreover, memory points 1, 2, and 6 provide additional insight into Speaker A's work environment, which could influence conversations related to food and work experiences.\n\nThough not directly aligned with the context, memory point 5 gives insight into Speaker A's work schedule, which could affect future dialogue planning their meetups or conversations related to work-life balance. Meanwhile, memory point 4 about Speaker B's preferences might be indirectly relevant if the new dish is Mediterranean, creating a connection between Speaker A's work and Speaker B's interests. \n\nOverall, MEMORY sentences are well-structured, establishing a clear development and context when combined with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
