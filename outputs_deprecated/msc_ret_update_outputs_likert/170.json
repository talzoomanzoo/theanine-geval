Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me? Speaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week? Speaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day Speaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through Speaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested. Speaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n2. Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n3. Speaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights.\n4. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\n5. Speaker A mentioned the warm weather at their location.\n6. Speaker A has visited Alaska and describes it as beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You'll be happy to hear that in the summer, walking and biking are great options here! The snow melts, and the city is very pedestrian-friendly. Renting a car isn't necessary, but it could be convenient if we decide to go on a glacier tour or pet some wolves.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of relevant information that can aid in generating a suitable next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, MEMORY sentences 1, 2, 3, and 5 are particularly helpful as they directly relate to the potential visit and activities planned between Speaker A and Speaker B. Sentence 1 reiterates Speaker A's plan to take Speaker B to folk concerts, which aligns with their current conversation. Sentence 2 reinforces Speaker B's interest in combining the concert with other outdoor activities. Sentence 3 highlights the logistics of looking into flights, while sentence 5 recalls the mention of warm weather, which is relevant as travel planning may be influenced by weather conditions.\n\nSentences 4 and 6, while not directly related to the specific topics discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, provide background that could shape the conversation positively. Sentence 4 emphasizes Speaker A's excitement about the visit, and sentence 6 offers past information about Alaska, which can create a sense of familiarity and comfort for Speaker B. The information is naturally phrased, which allows the language model to distinguish the most pertinent details easily.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is coherent and contains meaningful details that demonstrate causality and relevancy with respect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, thus earning a score of 4."
