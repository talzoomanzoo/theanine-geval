Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes.  Speaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me. Speaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n2. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n3. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n4. Speaker A hears raccoons and cats fighting in their neighborhood.\n5. Speaker A is worried about the raccoon potentially eating the bearded dragon.\n6. Speaker A is interested in animals, specifically raccoons and bearded dragons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I understand your concern. It's important to keep your home and pets safe. Hopefully, with the aluminum sheeting in place, you won't have to worry about unwanted visitors. Just keep an eye out for any signs of raccoons trying to get in.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker A and Speaker B's previous interactions and their perspectives on raccoons. For instance, it captures Speaker A's concern about a raccoon problem and their plan to use aluminum sheeting, which aligns with the context in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Speaker B's positive view of raccoons as potentially good pets is also relevant, though not directly mentioned in the dialogue, it helps understand Speaker B's suggestion of befriending the raccoons.\n\nHowever, some parts of MEMORY are less relevant to the current dialogue since they were not mentioned or implied in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, the mention of Speaker B taking care of a raccoon for over a month and training it, or Speaker A hearing raccoons and cats fighting in their neighborhood. These aspects do not directly aid in generating a response related to the dialogue.\n\nWhile the MEMORY sentences are structured naturally and provide a background context, not all of them are closely tied to the current interaction. A higher score would require more direct relevance to the conversation and a clearer link between the MEMORY items and the ongoing dialogue context."
