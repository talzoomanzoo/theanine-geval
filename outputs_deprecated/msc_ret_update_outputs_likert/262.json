Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n2. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n3. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n4. Speaker A enjoys hiking and just finished a 5-mile hike with a friend named Dave.\n5. Speaker A goes hiking and does not vote.\n6. Speaker B feels overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and is eager to finish school to escape it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It went okay, I think I did decently. But I can't help feeling anxious about the results. The pressure to maintain straight A's is really getting to me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of helpful information that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the exam. Sentence 1 and 3 clearly relate Speaker B's situation concerning the sports medicine exam, which is directly related to the question from Speaker A. Sentence 3 additionally provides context about Speaker B's motivation and pressure, which is relevant for understanding any emotional undertone in Speaker B's response. Sentence 6 furthers this understanding by explaining Speaker B's broader emotional state. Although Sentence 2 about Speaker A's struggles and Sentence 5 about their hiking habits might not be directly related to the exam, they are still relevant to the dialogues' broader context and give background information about Speaker A's character. Sentence 4, while mentioning hiking, might not be as directly relevant but is still naturally phrased, allowing a language model to discern its lack of immediate applicability to the question about the exam. Overall, MEMORY establishes a well-connected context useful for generating a suitable response."
