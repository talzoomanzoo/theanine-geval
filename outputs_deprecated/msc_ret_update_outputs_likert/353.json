Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar. Speaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general? Speaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts. Speaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts? Speaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.  Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately? Speaker A: Water skiing? Yes, last weekend. It was so much fun! Speaker B: (sorry my typing sucks)  That's awesome. I wish had access to a boat, but who knows, maybe one day. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is excited to join Speaker A's family for a water skiing trip and wants to learn from Speaker A's kids.\n2. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n3. Speaker A has been water skiing for 15 years and has 3 kids who also water ski.\n4. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n5. Speaker B does not do a lot of cooking or baking but is interested in learning.\n6. Speaker B expresses interest in trying water skiing next.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "No worries about the typing! If you ever want to give water skiing a try, just let me know. Maybe we can plan a day out on the water together sometime.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY offers some helpful information for Speaker A to generate a response, but it is not entirely aligned with the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY sentences provide context about Speaker B's interest in water skiing (Sentence 6), their excitement to join Speaker A's family for a water skiing trip (Sentence 1), and their general interest in learning cooking or baking (Sentence 5). These insights could aid Speaker A in formulating responses related to outdoor activities or cooking lessons. However, some details are either irrelevant or incorrectly phrased within the context of the dialogue. For example, Sentence 2 inaccurately states that Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches jello recipes, which conflicts with the context where it's Speaker B teaching their kids the recipes. Sentence 4 is also misleading as there is no mention in the dialogue about Speaker A suggesting their grandmother as a surrogate for learning jello recipes. Overall, while the MEMORY has useful content, it lacks cohesion and contains inaccuracies that reduce its helpfulness in generating further dialogue within the context provided."
