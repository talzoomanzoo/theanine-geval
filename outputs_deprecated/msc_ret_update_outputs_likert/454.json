Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has devices to keep bugs away and offers to share the product names with Speaker B.\n2. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n3. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy barbecuing and have a love for pets.\n5. Speaker B plans to bring a new marinade and a six pack of beer for the gathering.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provided gives helpful and relevant context to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which aids Speaker A, represented by the language model, in generating a proper next response. There are several points in the MEMORY that are directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT: \n\n1. Statement 1 mentions Speaker A having devices to keep bugs away and offering product names, which is directly helpful given Speaker B's mention of needing bug spray due to mosquitoes.\n2. Statements 2, 3, and 5 provide context for the upcoming barbecue, indicating Speaker A's plans for grilling and Speaker B's intention to bring a marinade and beer. This information enriches the context around the gathering and supports a richer conversation.\n3. Statement 4, while not directly related to the immediate context, adds depth to the relationship, showing shared interests like barbecuing and pets.\n4. Statement 6 about discussing furniture and decor aligns with the mention of picking a color scheme for Speaker B's living room, suggesting an ongoing conversation topic.\n\nThe sentences are naturally structured and connected, providing a clear sense of development and interaction between Speaker A and Speaker B. However, not every piece in MEMORY is crucial to the generation of a response based on the specific context of the conversation, and there might be a slight detour into broader topics like enjoying quiet evenings or general love for pets, which are less directly tied to the current dialogue but are still naturally phrased. Thus, it receives a 4 out of 5."
