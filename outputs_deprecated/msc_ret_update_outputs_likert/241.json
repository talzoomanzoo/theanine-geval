Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n2. Speaker B shared tips on repelling mosquitos using sprays with 20% DEET and other active ingredients.\n3. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n4. Speaker B gets scared by bugs and creepy crawlies in the outdoors.\n5. Speaker A enjoys hiking, birdwatching, and spotting rare animals.\n6. Speaker A enjoys camping trips and looking for wild animals in the woods.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Not yet, but I can't wait to hit the trails this summer! I heard there are some great birdwatching spots along the Appalachian Trail. Have you ever spotted any rare birds on your hikes?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY is well structured and provides helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains relevant details such as Speaker B having recently gone on a long hike and enjoying it, which ties into the current conversation about hiking. Additionally, it links back to Speaker B's tips on using mosquito repellent, thus connecting past advice to Speaker A's recent actions of loading up on repellent and purchasing mosquito repellent bracelets. \n\nMoreover, the MEMORY provides insights into Speaker Aâ€™s interest in camping, hiking, and wildlife, as well as plans for the Appalachian Trail, which could serve as context for future responses. Speaker B's fear of bugs and creepy crawlies adds to the context of their experiences outdoors and might inform their tips and advice, making the conversation more personally relevant.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is well-curated, naturally structured, and offers specific cues that can help generate coherent and contextually suitable responses."
