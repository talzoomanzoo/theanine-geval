Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad. Speaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs! Speaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is looking to redecorate their house and likes purple furniture.\n2. Speaker B regrets their green and purple color scheme and is willing to give away their purple furniture.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices.\n4. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n5. Speaker A has devices to keep bugs away and offers to share the product names with Speaker B.\n6. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I got my patio furniture from a local store that specializes in outdoor furniture. They had a great selection, so I'm sure you'll find something you like. And don't worry about the green and purple color scheme, we can work together to find something that suits your taste better.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains useful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memories indicate Speaker B's dissatisfaction with their green and purple color scheme and their willingness to change their current furniture setup, which directly aligns with the conversation about redecorating their living space. MEMORY 2 is directly relevant as it encompasses Speaker B's regrets over their color scheme choices as mentioned in the context.\n\nMEMORY 3 provides a general statement about the ongoing conversation about furniture and home decor choices, which is directly relevant to the current exchange about color schemes and patio furniture. MEMORY 5 and MEMORY 6 refer to Speaker A's mention of bug sprays, which are relevant as Speaker A promises to bring a lamp to handle mosquitos.\n\nHowever, some specific details in MEMORY 1 are not accurately portrayed as Speaker A appreciating purple furniture isn't supported by the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Nevertheless, overall, the MEMORY contains different elements that are structured coherently and capture the past interaction's development, making it helpful for generating future dialogues."
