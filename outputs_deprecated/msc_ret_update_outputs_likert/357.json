Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n2. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n3. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n4. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n5. Speaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies.\n6. Speaker B is interested in playing Jurassic Park: World but has not played it yet.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, I did! I actually started playing Resident Evil VIII, and it's been quite the thrilling experience. The atmosphere can get pretty intense, but it's also so exciting to explore the game world and uncover the story. If you ever decide to give it a try, just remember to take it slow and conserve your resources. It can be quite challenging, but that's part of the fun!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several relevant pieces of information that are helpful for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is clear from the MEMORY that Speaker A and Speaker B have had conversations about playing Resident Evil, and that Speaker B is specifically interested in it and has even purchased the latest version. This context helps establish the connection and relevance to Speaker A's inquiry about Resident Evil. Furthermore, the MEMORY also highlights Speaker A's hesitation towards playing Resident Evil and their preference for tamer video games, which could influence Speaker B's response. However, the MEMORY includes additional information about Speaker B's interest in Jurassic Park: World, which is not directly relevant to the current dialogue context. Overall, the MEMORY is quite helpful, clearly shows past interactions, and is mostly relevant to the dialogue context."
