Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make? Speaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it. Speaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too? Speaker B: Yeah definitely! I know you like hot foods, so if you learn and can make them fresh it will taste amazing. Have you tried any new foods lately? Speaker A: Not any new foods, but I did try a new food truck near me that was delicious! It was street tacos and you could pick from barbacoa, chicken, and steak for the protein. Do you like Mexican food? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\n2. Speaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally.\n3. Speaker A plays the drums and loves making food for others.\n4. Speaker A enjoys cooking and finds it helpful for stress relief.\n5. Speaker A cooked steak, fried potatoes, and shrimp for dinner with their father.\n6. Speaker B's hobbies include snowboarding, listening to music, singing, spending time with family, and cooking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Mexican food is fantastic! I love the flavors and variety it offers. The street tacos sound mouth-watering, especially with those protein options. Next time you try them, maybe you can add a touch of your cooking expertise to enhance the flavors further.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context about Speaker B's cooking interests, especially the mention of the grandmother's garlic chicken recipe, which connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B expresses their fondness for the garlic chicken. This connection aids in establishing Speaker B's culinary background and enthusiasm for cooking for loved ones, which is relevant to the ongoing conversation about cooking and trying new foods. \n\nHowever, the rest of the MEMORY entries about Speaker A and Speaker B's other hobbies and activities, such as playing drums, snowboarding, and cooking for family in general, do not directly contribute to the dialogue about trying new foods, teaching recipes, or specific culinary experiences shared in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These parts of the MEMORY are naturally structured and easy to read but are not closely related or particularly helpful in developing the next potential response regarding the conversation's focus on food and cooking.\n\nOverall, while there is some relevant information to help generate responses in the dialogue context, not all of it is directly applicable, hence the score of 3."
