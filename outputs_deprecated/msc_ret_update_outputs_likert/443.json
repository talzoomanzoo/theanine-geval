Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast. Speaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it.\n2. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\n3. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things.\n4. Speaker A is a martial arts teacher and student and is pursuing an athletic training degree in college.\n5. Speaker A is a college student who teaches jiu-jitsu and is lactose intolerant.\n6. Speaker B is busy debugging software and is a runner.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, there was a good turnout today. It's always nice to see so many people eager to learn. How's your project going?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several relevant pieces of information that can be used by Speaker A to generate a suitable response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Firstly, it highlights Speaker A's interest and participation in martial arts classes, as well as their ongoing pursuit of an athletic training degree, which is directly related to the context of attending a martial arts class and having a blast. Similarly, MEMORY notes that Speaker B is also interested in martial arts, which provides a common interest point that speaker A can reference. Additionally, knowing that Speaker B is engaged in software work and busy debugging might aid in generating a response that acknowledges their workload with empathy or curiosity about Speaker B's project. \n\nHowever, there are some unrelated details, such as Speaker A's teaching and lactose intolerance, which, although phrased naturally, do not directly connect to the current dialogue. This is why the score is not a perfect 5. Still, the MEMORY does contribute relevant background information for the continuation of the conversation."
