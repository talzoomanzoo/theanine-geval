Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it? Speaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see.  Speaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece.\n2. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian.\n3. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\n4. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five.\n5. Speaker A has traveled around Europe before, visiting capital cities of each country.\n6. Speaker B asks Speaker A if their trip is more for relaxation or sightseeing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's been a few years since I last visited, but the memories are still so vivid. I'm sure you and your family will have an incredible time exploring the history and beauty of Greece. Make sure to take lots of photos and enjoy every moment!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided includes several pieces of information related to Speaker B's interest in Greece and their travel plans, but it does not significantly focus on the Acropolis or past interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B regarding this specific landmark. While there is some useful contextual information, such as Speaker B's excitement about visiting Greece and Speaker A's experience with traveling around Europe, the MEMORY generally lacks closely relevant details that directly assist in generating a next response for the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Most information is loosely related or completely unrelated to the discussion at hand, such as the mention of the beach on Corfu Island and the family travel plans, which does not directly aid the ongoing dialogue about the Acropolis itself. Overall, the MEMORY needs more directly relevant and well-structured information to achieve a higher helpfulness score."
