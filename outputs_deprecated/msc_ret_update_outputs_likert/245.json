Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me. Speaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway? Speaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible. Speaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n2. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n3. Speaker A leads hikes for the group they camp with, which are usually an hour or two long.\n4. Speaker A is nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes.\n5. Speaker A enjoys camping trips and looking for wild animals in the woods.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy being outdoors, but Speaker B prefers the fresh air over being in the mud and rain.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I understand, bugs can definitely be a nuisance. I mostly lead hikes in the local trails near our camping spot, but I'm planning a big trip this summer along the Appalachian Trail. It's going to be a challenge for me, but I'm excited to explore new terrains.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides partial helpfulness for generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. Some memories do not align with the information in the dialogue context. For example, MEMORY item 6 implies both enjoy the outdoors, contradicting Speaker B's stated dislike of the outdoors in the context.\n2. MEMORY mentions Speaker A's planning for camping trips and leading hikes, which correlates with Speaker A's activity of leading a hike in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, providing some helpful context.\n3. The MEMORY notes Speaker A is planning a hike on the Appalachian Trail and Speaker A's enjoyment of camping and looking for wild animals, which is contextually interesting, but not immediately relevant to the current conversation about hiking experiences with friends and the dislike of bugs mentioned by Speaker B.\n4. The details about Speaker A being nervous about a demanding hike are useful for understanding character development and future responses, though not directly mentioned in the dialogue context.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY provides some useful background which could inform the tone and future planning in the dialogue, not all information is directly relevant or in alignment with the current conversation between the speakers. The connections within the MEMORY are not fully coherent with the ongoing dialogue, leading to a mid-level rating."
