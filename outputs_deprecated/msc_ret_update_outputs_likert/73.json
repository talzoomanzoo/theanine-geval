    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music. Speaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band? Speaker B: I'm big fan of aerosmith. When do you learn music. Whom teach you? Speaker A: aerosmith are great, have you ever seen them live?

Still I didn't get right teacher. I'm jealous on you. I don't have like your dad. Speaker A: what instrument have you been trying to learn? Speaker B: Piano is my favorite instrument. When try play my mind was mesmerizing. How do you learn surfering?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B finds fishing easier than surfing, but is interested in trying surfing.\n2. Speaker B is willing to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook.\n3. Speaker B wishes they had time to go surfing and is considering getting lessons at a surf shop.\n4.

    "raw_prediction": "I learned how to surf when I was just a kid, growing up on the beach. My dad taught me how to catch those waves. It's all about balance and feeling the rhythm of the ocean. It's a lot like playing music, actually.",
    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly the parts about Speaker A being in a band and playing music, which supports the conversation about learning and playing musical instruments. However, most of the MEMORY is focused on surfing and fishing, which is not relevant to the current context about music and musical instruments. The connections among the sentences are clear and naturally expressed. However, they are predominately focused on activities unrelated to music, which limits their helpfulness in generating the next response for the given dialogue context. The MEMORY could be more useful if it included more relevant musical interactions between Speakers A and B."
