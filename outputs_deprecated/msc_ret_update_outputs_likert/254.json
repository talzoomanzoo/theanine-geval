    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you? Speaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses. Speaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set? Speaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n2. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.\n3. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n4. Speaker A prefers classic horror movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th over modern ones.\n5. Speaker B has a government job that pays the bills but wishes they could work in interior design.\n6. Speaker A has recently received a call for a job interview and is excited about it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a scene straight out of a horror movie itself! The dedication and passion that goes into creating those realistic effects must be truly remarkable. It's those unexpected moments that make the filmmaking process so thrilling and unique.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information, but not completely aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 5 in the MEMORY are directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as they provide insights into Speaker B's interest in creative activities like making horror movies and their government job. Additionally, Sentence 1 gives context about Speaker B's collaboration with their dad in creating horror movies, which could be beneficial for generating a response that connects with Speaker B's personal experiences. \n\nHowever, the remaining sentences (2, 3, 4, and 6) provide less relevant details that do not effectively aid a response based on the current dialogue. While Sentence 3 gives some information about Speaker A's design preferences, it doesn't directly connect to the specific creative activities discussed in the dialogue. Sentence 2 mentions Speaker A's belief about horror movies, but doesn't align with the conversational focus on personal experiences or stories related to making movies. Sentence 4 gives movie preferences of Speaker A, which isn't too helpful without more context connecting it back to the dialogue. Sentence 6 could be helpful background information about Speaker A, but in the context of this specific conversation, it does not add value to creating a relevant response. \n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides a mix of relevant and less relevant information, some of which is well-structured and aids in understanding the development of Speaker B's creative pursuits, but contains some sentences that do not clearly contribute to the current conversation."
