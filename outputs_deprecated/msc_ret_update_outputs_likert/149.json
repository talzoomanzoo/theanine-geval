Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping? Speaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp? Speaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer? Speaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping? Speaker B: We usually do tents but we have camped in yurts too. Did you go to the zoo last weekend? Speaker A: I see. Yes, I did make it to the zoo.  Have you gone to your local zoo?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n2. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys.\n3. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n4. Speaker A suggests taking the pets to the zoo and mentions that most major cities have good zoos.\n5. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n6. Speaker B is interested in finding family discounts for the zoo.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, we've been to our local zoo a few times. My daughter loves seeing all the animals, especially the monkeys. I've been looking into family discounts for our next visit.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY is quite helpful in providing a comprehensive understanding of Speaker B's interest in visits to the zoo, as well as their family's enthusiasm about such trips. The information about Speaker B being a parent and pushing for a field trip aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where they inquire about Speaker A's recent zoo visit. Details about Speaker B's child wanting to see the monkeys and seeking discounts are useful contextual cues that support potential continuity in conversation about zoos. However, the information about Speaker A's frequent visits to the zoo and specific animal preferences could be less relevant to help Speaker B generate a response unless Speaker A brings them up as topics again. Overall, MEMORY provides structured background insights which are relevant, even if not all directly related to the conversation's progression toward camping discussions."
