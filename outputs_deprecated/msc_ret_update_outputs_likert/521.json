Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer? Speaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to? Speaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods.\n2. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo.\n3. Speaker A is planning to visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend.\n4. Speaker B is waiting for bands to announce their summer tour schedule to plan which shows to attend.\n5. Speaker B recommends visiting the Museum of Art of São Paulo in the city.\n6. Speaker B enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food and live music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "No, the concert I attended was actually indoors at a local venue. But an outdoor concert sounds amazing, especially in the summer. Have you been to any outdoor music events in São Paulo?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant background information that could be helpful for generating a next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically:\n\n1. Sentence 1 states that Speaker A enjoys going to museums, which aligns with A's interest in attending an art museum as mentioned in the dialogue.\n2. Sentence 5, where Speaker B recommends visiting the Museum of Art of São Paulo, aligns with the context of discussing art museums.\n3. Sentence 4 gives context to Speaker B's interest in concerts, which relates to their attendance of a music concert on the fourth of July mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nHowever, several sentences in MEMORY provide information that isn't immediately relevant or helpful for responding to the current dialogue. For example, Sentence 2 mentions Speaker A's plans to visit São Paulo, which doesn't directly connect to the current discussion of concerts or the specific art museum being mentioned. Similarly, Sentence 6 talks about Speaker B's general enjoyment of city life, which could connect to the dialogue about concert experiences, but lacks specificity.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY contains a mix of potentially helpful and irrelevant details, and it could be slightly more structured and connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT to increase its helpfulness."
