Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting! Speaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow? Speaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from. Speaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same. Speaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal. Speaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab! Speaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor? Speaker B: Yes, more ice cream is always good, haha! I like a good rocky road, or pretty much any chocolate ice cream with nuts or stir-ins! I like most of Jeni's brand too. How about you? What is your favorite kind? Speaker A: I am a big fan of cookie dough ice cream, and I love cheesecake flavored ice creams too! Ben & Jerry has some that I like, but I prefer to get ice cream from an ice cream shop.  It's just something about being in that environment, Speaker B: Yes, ice cream shops are the best! They have stir-ins, and the smells are heavenly! Ben and Jerry's used to have a blueberry cheesecake that was amazing! I have only had that and their strawberry flavors. Both were great! Speaker A: YES! You get it. Now I want to go to an ice cream shop. I might apply for a part-time job at an ice cream shop since I'm not working.  Do you enjoy your job as a fry cook? I think the food & restaurant industries may be similar.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n2. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n3. Speaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night.\n4. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n6. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I do enjoy my job as a fry cook! It's fast-paced and keeps me on my toes. Plus, I get to experiment with different flavors and dishes. Working in the food industry definitely has some similarities with the ice cream shop environment you enjoy. It's all about creating a positive experience for the customers through delicious food!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a moderate level of helpfulness for generating the next response in the dialogue context. The contextual information about Speaker B working at a diner and having an interest in lab research is relevant, as it ties into their character and current life situation. Additionally, details about Speaker B's work and education plans align with the dialogue context's discussion of job and academic responsibilities.\n\nHowever, some information in MEMORY, like the specific details about hamburgers and chilli dog casserole, is not directly relevant to the ongoing conversation about ice cream, plant-based burgers, or cloning. While these sentences are structured naturally, they don't directly contribute to the flow of the current dialogue context and focus on other aspects of Speaker A and B's relationship. Some sentences provide valuable context, while others do not significantly support the conversation. Thus, a score of 3 reflects this balance between helpful and less-relevant information."
