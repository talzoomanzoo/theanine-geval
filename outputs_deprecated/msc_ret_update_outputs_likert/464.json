Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece.\n2. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian.\n3. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\n4. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five.\n5. Speaker B asks Speaker A if their trip is more for relaxation or sightseeing.\n6. Speaker A hasn't planned their trip out yet but is open to suggestions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Oh, that's wonderful! The Acropolis in Athens is truly a sight to behold. Make sure to take your time exploring the Parthenon, it's absolutely stunning. The history and architecture there are fascinating. You and your family will have an amazing time exploring all the ancient ruins.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context to generate a response for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Some sentences relate directly to the context where Speaker B has previously recommended visiting the Acropolis, which aligns with Speaker A's mention of their upcoming visit there. This provides a foundation for Speaker B to expand on their recommendation by offering more details about the Acropolis in the dialogue. \n\nHowever, much of the MEMORY is focused on Speaker B's own plans and excitement rather than concrete information about the Acropolis itself, which would be more directly useful for Speaker Aâ€™s current query. Sentences about Speaker B's trip and preferences (e.g., their love for Athena, their family size, etc.) do not offer immediate relevance to helping Speaker A learn about the Acropolis. Nevertheless, these sentences are naturally phrased and not too distracting, potentially serving as conversation points in a broader dialogue. Overall, the MEMORY provides some helpful context, but it could be more specific and directly informative to be rated higher."
