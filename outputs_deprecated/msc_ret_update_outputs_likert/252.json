    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you? Speaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has a government job that pays the bills but wishes they could work in interior design.\n2. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.\n3. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n4. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n5. Speaker B has two kids and enjoys painting and taking naps.\n6. Speaker A finds job searching challenging and hopes to settle in the new city soon with a steady income.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear that you're enjoying producing horror movies! It's wonderful to have a creative passion that brings you fulfillment. Maybe you can find a way to incorporate your love for painting into your movie sets or props. It could add a unique touch to your films and combine your talents in a new and exciting way.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Points 4 and 1 connect to the conversation about Speaker B working on horror movies and having a passion for interior design but acknowledging the latter may not be a good fit. However, the MEMORY contains inaccuracies as point 1 states Speaker B wishes they could work in interior design, which contrasts with their statement in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT indicating uncertainty about interior design being a good fit. Additionally, other points like 2, 3, 5, and 6, offer some context about both speakers' hobbies and challenges but are not directly related to the conversation at hand. While point 4 provides natural development about how Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, the rest of the information is extraneous. This mixed relevance reduces the overall helpfulness in generating a proper next response."
