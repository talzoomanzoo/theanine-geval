Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work? Speaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol Speaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise?  Speaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n3. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n4. Speaker A plans to bring sandwiches and fruit for the hike, specifically asking about veggie sandwiches for Speaker B.\n5. Speaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality.\n6. Speaker B's neighbor, John, is getting divorced and selling top-of-the-line camping gear.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a fantastic idea! You have a real passion for the outdoors, so being a guide would be such a fulfilling career for you. Sometimes, following our passions can lead us to unexpected opportunities. Who knows, maybe one day you'll be leading hiking tours in the same area where I'll be working at the grocery store!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information that could be helpful for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not perfectly aligned with the current conversation between Speakers A and B. Relevant points include:\n\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail, which may have some relevance to Speaker B's interest in working with the park system or as a guide (detailed in the dialogue context).\n2. Speaker B's interests in camping and hiking are mentioned in the MEMORY, aligning with the conversation about jobs related to the park system.\n3. Speaker B's neighbor, John, who is mentioned in both the context and memory, adds some depth to the conversation by providing additional personal background.\n\nHowever, there are several pieces of information that don't directly connect to the conversation or are not clearly linked, such as Speaker A's plan to bring sandwiches on a hike or the fact that they are on a cross-country journey. These might provide richer context in another discussion where such details are relevant, but they don't contribute significantly to the current dialogue. \n\nOverall, while there are helpful elements within the MEMORY, the information is not fully cohesive or directly aligned with the ongoing context to warrant a higher score."
