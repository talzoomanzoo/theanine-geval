    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?   Speaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere! Speaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it. Speaker A: I don't have recipes but I know how to make a good grilled asparagus. Are you looking to bolster your chef book? Speaker B: I sure am!  Grilled asparagus does sound good.  Do you pair the grilled asparagus with your fajitas?  What do you prefer, chicken or beef fajitas? Speaker A: I prefer chicken to beef. I pair it with beef fajitas andI think it's great to have with a glass of merlot. Do you like wine? Speaker B: You're making me hungry!  Yes, I do love wine.  As a matter of fact, I used to live in the Bordeaux region in France, so my favorite wine is Bordeaux wine.  But I also love champagne and cognac. Speaker A: Haha, I know right? I lived in the Champagne region for a bit! Always wanted to go to Bordeaux. How was it there? Speaker B: I didn't know that you also lived in France for a while!  I love French food, especially the bread and fruit pastries.  Living in Bordeaux was fun!  I had the chance to visit all the prehistoric caves with paintings in the Southwest region of France.  Plus, Spain was just a few hours away by train, so I visited Spain quite a few times as well.  Oh, the good old times.  If only I were this excited about my career!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B are excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines.\n2. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters.\n3. Speaker A enjoys grilling indoors and suggests grilled asparagus with lemon on it.\n4. Speaker B is interested in becoming a chef but hasn't had the time to apply for jobs.\n5. Speaker A suggests that working as a line cook or chef involves a big time commitment and building a working family.\n6. Speaker A is more interested in science than music, while Speaker B enjoys listening to Black Sabbath and grilling meat.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It sounds like you had an amazing time in France and Spain! Exploring prehistoric caves and experiencing different cultures must have been quite an adventure. Don't worry about your career excitement; sometimes it just takes finding the right path. Maybe cooking and traveling could be part of your career if you pursue becoming a chef!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context that could be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A's enjoyment of cooking and grilling, which implies familiarity with recipes (relevant to the asparagus dish mentioned). Information about Speaker B's interest in becoming a chef also aligns with their desire to bolster their chef book, providing useful background context. However, certain details like enjoying Black Sabbath or volunteering at animal shelters are not directly helpful to the specific conversation about wine, French experiences, and recipes with asparagus. Moreover, these extra details could make it slightly harder for a model to identify which information is most pertinent to the ongoing dialogue. Therefore, while the MEMORY does offer some helpful context, not all elements are directly useful and some could distract from generating a cohesive next response."
