Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand. Speaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  Speaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery Speaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library?  Speaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done Speaker B: Well if you ever need someone to come and help for a couple of hours here and there, give me a call, you know how much I love to be in the library anyway Speaker A: I will keep that in mind as we do have volunteer hours available. How is your family doing these days?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n2. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n3. Speaker A is a retired librarian who enjoys implementing creative activities in their library.\n4. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n5. Speaker A sees parents bringing in their little kids to the library as encouraging.\n6. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "The family is doing well, thank you for asking. We've been keeping busy with the grandkids and planning for our next fishing adventure. It's always great to spend time outdoors with them and see their reactions to nature.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information that are relevant and helpful for generating subsequent responses in the dialogue context. The details about Speaker Bâ€™s enjoyment of spending time with their grandkids and their interest in making the fishing trip an annual tradition align well with the context of discussing fishing trips and spending time with family. Additionally, Speaker B's willingness to help at the library, even though not directly reflected in the MEMORY, is closely related to Speaker B's awareness of Speaker A's involvement with the library as seen in the MEMORY entry about Speaker A enjoying implementing creative activities.\n\nHowever, some entries, such as Speaker A being a retired librarian, mixed reactions of Speaker B's grandkids to fishing, and Speaker A's encouragement from seeing little kids in the library, although naturally phrased, are not directly beneficial to the current dialogue. Therefore, while most of the MEMORY provides helpful context and development, not all sentences are directly useful to the progression of the current conversation."
