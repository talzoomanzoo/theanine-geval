Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n2. Speaker A hears raccoons and cats fighting in their neighborhood.\n3. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n4. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n5. Speaker A is worried about the raccoon potentially eating the bearded dragon.\n6. Speaker A is interested in animals, specifically raccoons and bearded dragons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! Hopefully, the aluminum sheeting will help keep the raccoons away from your garbage. Have you noticed any improvements in the situation since you put it up?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information for generating a response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker A's raccoon problem and their plan to use aluminum sheeting to address it (point 1), which is directly relevant to the current context. Additionally, it notes Speaker A's interest in animals and specific concerns about raccoons (points 5 and 6), which might be useful for crafting a more personalized response. Speaker B's interest in raccoons as pets (points 3 and 4) is somewhat relevant since it could influence their reaction or advice to Speaker A's situation.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY contains some details, such as raccoons and cats fighting (point 2), that don't directly contribute to understanding or developing the current interaction. The overall connectedness and relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT could be improved, as not all points are linked in a coherent developmental way or directly inform how to respond to Speaker Aâ€™s situation with providing aluminum sheeting. Thus, the rating is 3, as the MEMORY contains both some helpful insights and some less relevant details."
