Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming? Speaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both. Speaker A: That sounds interesting. That's great that you love your job, not many people do. Speaker B: Love is a strong word! I do like it though. There have been jobs I hated and I'm great full not be in that place. Hows you job going? Speaker A: Its going good. Its summer so we are really busy right now. I am just grateful to be back at work. How long have you worked for your company? Speaker B: For about four years. It's an industry in flux which is stressful. I need stability for my family at this point. It has changed my focus, which I'm not used to yet. Are you considering any other options for work? Speaker A: Yes I am considering going back to school for dentistry. I am trying to get grants for the money I need. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is considering going back to school for dentistry in the future.\n2. Speaker A is considering a career in dentistry but is also interested in working at Disney for happiness.\n3. Speaker A is torn between choosing a career in dentistry for the money or working at Disney for happiness.\n4. Speaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates.\n5. Speaker B's mother is a dentist and loves her job.\n6. Speaker A has been looking at dental programs in colleges.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a big decision to go back to school for dentistry! Have you always had an interest in that field, or is it a recent consideration?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some information that could be useful for Speaker B in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The first sentence in the MEMORY directly reflects a point from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions considering going back to school for dentistry. Sentences 2 and 3 provide additional context about Speaker A's decision-making, highlighting a potential interest in working at Disney, which could be relevant if Speaker B wants to engage more deeply with Speaker A's career considerations.\n\nHowever, several points in the MEMORY lack direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 4 mentions Speaker B's work situation regarding the computer company, which relates indirectly to their need for stability but not directly to the ongoing conversation. Sentence 5 about Speaker B's mother being a dentist seems unnecessary unless the conversation had touched upon family or parental influence before. Sentence 6, although relevant to Speaker A's consideration of dentistry, doesn't stand out as pivotal unless specifically mentioned in the dialogue, as is the case only partially with sentence 1.\n\nOverall, while MEMORY does contain some relevant points that connect with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker Aâ€™s career considerations, the connections among the sentences could be clearer, and some information seems extraneous."
