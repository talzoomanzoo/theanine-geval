Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n2. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n3. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n4. Both speakers value good grades and believe it can lead to better job opportunities.\n5. Speaker B feels overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and is eager to finish school to escape it.\n6. Speaker A advises Speaker B to take breaks and prioritize their own happiness and well-being.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Don't be too hard on yourself. A B is still a good grade. It's great that you're already thinking about what you can do better next time. Just keep pushing yourself, and I'm sure you'll see even better results in the future.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several relevant pieces of information that could be beneficial for Speaker B, who is preparing for exams. The details about Speaker B studying sports medicine and feeling pressured to maintain good grades (points 1 and 3) are directly applicable to the current conversation about upcoming exams. Additionally, Speaker B's feelings of being overwhelmed by their mother's expectations (point 5) might influence their current state during the exam period. The mention of both speakers valuing good grades (point 4) connects with the context of discussing exam results and preparations, which could guide Speaker B's next responses. Lastly, the memory of Speaker A advising Speaker B to take breaks (point 6) could be a relevant follow-up to provide support or advice. Overall, most of the MEMORY is naturally connected and helpful, though some points are more relevant than others."
