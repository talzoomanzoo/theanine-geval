Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? Speaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n2. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n3. Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets.\n4. Speaker A is focused on saving money and not planning to have children in the near future.\n5. Speaker B likes poetry and fantasy books, and has a pet cat.\n6. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a good plan. It's important to make sure you have enough time to settle in the new kitten before going away. Plus, it gives you something to look forward to when you get back from your vacation.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides partial helpfulness in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 1 is highly relevant to the current dialogue and provides helpful background information, indicating that Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten, which aligns directly with the conversation about potentially getting a friend's kitten. Sentence 5 also mentions that Speaker B has a pet cat, which is somewhat relevant as it gives context to their potential decision to adopt another cat. However, the rest of the sentences in MEMORY (2, 3, 4, and 6) offer information that doesn't directly connect or add value to the particular dialogue about adopting a kitten and Speaker B's vacation plans. While some sentences could enrich background understanding, they aren't essential or causally connected to the immediate dialogue context. The natural phrasing throughout MEMORY helps to identify relevant and non-relevant information easily."
