Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n2. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n3. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n4. Speaker A suggests taking naps during quiet times and mentions watching her grandkids.\n5. Speaker A enjoys watching Jeopardy with their grandchildren and cooking for them, with the busiest time being the weekend.\n6. Speaker B is a parent to a young son who keeps them busy throughout the day.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, it was a nice change of pace. Sometimes a quiet afternoon with a good book is just what I need after keeping up with my energetic grandkids.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant context for Speaker A's background and habits, which could be helpful in responding to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights that Speaker A is usually involved in activities with their grandchildren, which aligns with the reason for having a break today. However, most of the memories focus on Speaker A's experiences with the grandchildren rather than finding a book or discussing its excitement. While these details add depth to Speaker A's character, they don't directly relate to the context about the book checked out. Furthermore, there is a mention of Speaker B being a parent, which might help in building conversational empathy and connection between the speakers, even though it doesn't specifically help in continuing the current dialogue about the book. Overall, the MEMORY provides some useful context but lacks direct relevance to the current dialogue topic."
