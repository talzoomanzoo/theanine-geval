Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it. Speaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it. Speaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping? Speaker B: I love being out in the wilderness and sleeping under the stars in the fresh air. It makes you realize how beautiful life is and how small we really are in comparison to the universe. Speaker A: I miss doing that! I have done lots of picnics with my family but it's been a long time since I've slept in a tent! Looking forward to it again when the kids are older. Where was the last place you went? Speaker B: We went up to an island in the middle of nowhere in Canada. There were lots of bears and huge moose! Speaker A: Wow, that sounds like such an adventure! I love to visit Canada. I have seen moose but never a bear! That must have been scary!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\n2. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n3. Speaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat.\n4. Speaker A is involved in church activities and mentioned a church retreat\n5. Speaker B is a member of the boy scouts and works at a fast food place\n6. Speaker B plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge for college applications.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It was definitely an adventure! Seeing bears up close was a bit intimidating, but we followed all the safety protocols and enjoyed the experience. Canada is such a beautiful place for outdoor adventures, you should definitely plan a trip there with your family sometime!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful context for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The fact that Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years and is currently a Life Scout (point 2) helps explain their knowledge of survival skills and appreciation for camping, which is relevant to the conversation. Additionally, Speaker B's plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge (point 6) complements their dedication to Boy Scouts mentioned in the conversation. However, other details, such as Speaker B's work at a fast food place (point 5) or Speaker A's involvement in church activities (point 4), do not directly enrich the conversation about camping and survival skills. While they provide some character background, they are not particularly useful for continuing this specific dialogue, affecting the overall helpfulness score."
