Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think? Speaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons Speaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n2. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n3. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n4. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n5. Speaker B enjoys fishing and wishes their wife and sons could have joined them on the trip.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B have a conversation about their personal interests and trips they have taken for work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I hadn't thought about adding their birth dates, that's a nice touch. I'll definitely take my time to pick the right font, thanks for the suggestion.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains several helpful pieces of information regarding Speaker A's interest in getting tattoos, which aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about getting a new tattoo to honor their mother. The first sentence establishes that Speaker A is considering a portrait of their father's face with a slogan, which contextualizes their interest in getting tattoos for family members. The second sentence reveals that Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and already has a tattoo dedicated to their late father, further supporting their intent to honor their mother with a tattoo. Additionally, the third sentence about Speaker A saving up for their next tattoo adds context to their motivation.\n\nThe MEMORY also includes information that provides additional context, such as Speaker B's interest in fishing, and Speaker A's work at a coffee shop, and that Speaker Aâ€™s mom owned the coffee shop. While these details are not strictly necessary for generating a response to the current dialogue context, they are phrased in a way that helps to build the picture of past interactions and personal details, making them easily identifiable and separate from the tattoo-related information.\n\nOverall, while some details may be tangential, the MEMORY does a good job of maintaining coherence and relevance to the dialogue, helping a language model generate meaningful, contextually-informed responses."
