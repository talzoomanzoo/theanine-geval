Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her? Speaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon Speaker A: Yes I have been saving up for another trip to Italy! I can't wait. It's planned for next Spring. Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future? Speaker B: I would love to get back to Italy but need to save up and the hopeful priority is to Greece this year.  You have friends in Europe are you in contact to see what plans you can make? Speaker A: Yes I've been talking to them quite a bit so they know what's going on. I'll be staying with some of them while I'm over there. I have never been to Greece....I'd like to go though. Maybe I'll add it to my itinerary! Maybe we could plan to be in Greece at the same time?! Speaker B: That would be so good.  There is so much history and the roman statues i take my daughter to see in the museums and through our local resources is fab.  She is building up the passion which is lovely to see.  Have you still got your hair blue or has it grown out now?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology.\n2. Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries.\n3. Speaker A is planning to travel to Italy alone for Spring Break and has friends from Europe meeting up with them.\n4. Speaker B has been to Italy in the past and enjoyed the food there.\n5.

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad to hear your daughter is getting into Greek mythology! It's great to share those interests with the next generation. Also, my blue hair has grown out now. I'm actually heading to a hair appointment for my birthday to decide on a new color.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of information that are helpful for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. Sentence 1 is directly relevant because it confirms Speaker B's interest in visiting Greece for its history and Greek mythology, which aligns with their current discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\n2. Sentence 2 connects with Speaker A's planning to visit Italy, supporting their interest in architecture, history, and connecting with friends in Europe, although the specifics about documentaries are not explicitly mentioned.\n\n3. Sentence 3 confirms Speaker A's travel plans to Italy, which is directly related to the conversation about Speaker A staying with friends in Europe.\n\n4. Sentence 4 provides background on Speaker B's previous trips to Italy, which is not directly relevant to the immediate context but useful for understanding their travel experiences.\n\n5. Sentence 5 adds depth to Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology, which helps explain their intent to visit Greece and share it with their daughter.\n\n6. Sentence 6 is not directly related to the current context about traveling but is naturally phrased and could be easily identified by the model as not relevant.\n\nOverall, the memory provides a coherent development of past interactions. The model can use this information to understand both speakers' shared interests and plans, particularly focusing on travel. Hence, it is given a score of 4 for its relevance and natural phrasing."
