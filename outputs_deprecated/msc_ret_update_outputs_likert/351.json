Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar. Speaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general? Speaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts. Speaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts? Speaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.  Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n2. Speaker B does not do a lot of cooking or baking but is interested in learning.\n3. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n4. Speaker B is excited to join Speaker A's family for a water skiing trip and wants to learn from Speaker A's kids.\n5. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n6. Speaker A is eating their favorite jello.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "We haven't been skiing recently, but we're planning a trip soon. I'm sure the kids would love to have you join us and maybe even teach you a thing or two about skiing. And who knows, maybe we can incorporate some jello-making into our trip as well!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains some helpful elements regarding the jello recipes and family traditions mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, item 1 provides relevant information, as it mentions Speaker A's grandmother teaching various jello recipes, which could connect to Speaker B's efforts to pass on a jello recipe from their grandmother. Additionally, item 5 highlights the connection Speaker A has to jello, specifically cherry flavor due to family dinners, resonating with Speaker B's emphasis on family traditions. However, other memory entries, such as items 3 and 4, seem less directly relevant to the current context. Item 2 provides some context about Speaker B's interest in cooking/baking, but it lacks direct correlation with the current dialogue about jello and learning to bake. Overall, while the MEMORY provides some useful background that can help generate an appropriate response, it could be more directly aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT for increased usefulness."
