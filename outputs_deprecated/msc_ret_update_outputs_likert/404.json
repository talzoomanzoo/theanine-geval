Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n2. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n3. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n4. Speaker A enjoys watching Jeopardy with their grandchildren and cooking for them, with the busiest time being the weekend.\n5. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n6. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I guess I just love the thrill of a good mystery! Keeps me on the edge of my seat, especially after all that non-stop energy from the grandkids.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information related to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically regarding Speaker A's relationship with their grandchildren. Memory points 1 and 2, which mention Speaker A being tired from watching their grandchildren and having grandchildren, help contextualize why Speaker A might have had time to check out a new book, as referenced in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This gives Speaker B understanding that when Speaker A doesn't watch their grandchildren, Speaker A engages in other activities such as reading. \n\nHowever, some memory points (3 and 5) are not directly relevant to the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT about book reading and the specific conversation about a crime drama and fiction preferences, although they are phrased quite naturally. Point 3 about Netflix preferences and Point 6 about grandchildren's activities might not add significant value to the conversation at hand. \n\nPoint 4 is somewhat useful as it outlines more about Speaker A's activities when with their grandchildren, contributing to the background narrative about Speaker A's typical busy schedule, which is relevant. \n\nOverall, the connection and context are somewhat helpful but not directly causative or necessary to evolve the immediate conversation about books. This is why this memory set does not receive a higher score."
