Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it! Speaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's husband enjoys Disney sports movies, such as 'Miracle'.\n2. Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good.\n3. Speaker B recommends Speaker A to watch 'Miracle'.\n4. Speaker B's kids enjoyed watching 'Luca' and said it was good.\n5. Speaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids.\n6. Speaker A also enjoys watching sports movies on Disney.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY is mostly helpful in providing context for generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 3 is directly relevant as it connects to the movie recommendation that Speaker B made to Speaker A, which is mentioned in the context. Sentences 1 and 2 offer additional context about how Speaker B's family enjoys Disney movies, which aligns well with the ongoing topic about \"Miracle\" being a Disney movie. This information aids in understanding the family's preferences, which could be relevant for the conversation's development. Though not directly related, sentence 4 about 'Luca' provides additional, naturally phrased context on family movie preferences. Sentence 5 provides general context about Speaker Bâ€™s enjoyment of family movie time, which is somewhat helpful. Sentence 6, relating Speaker A enjoying sports movies on Disney, is slightly less helpful due to a lack of concrete reference in the context, but still fits the overall theme. Overall, the sentences are well-phrased and provide relevant cues with clear connections about the speakers' shared interest in Disney movies, although could be more specific in relevance to the exact dialogue at hand."
