Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences.\n3. Speaker B enjoys watching suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy.\n4. Speaker A relies on Speaker B for movie suggestions, mentioning a preference for comedies.\n5. Speaker B used to teach Film Studies and carefully chooses what movies to watch.\n6. Speaker A enjoyed the movie \"Coming to America\" and expressed interest in watching its sequel.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad you enjoyed it! If you liked Pulp Fiction, you might also enjoy watching other Quentin Tarantino films like Reservoir Dogs or Kill Bill. Let me know if you want more suggestions in that style.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between Speaker A and Speaker B, particularly in relation to their shared interest in movies. The information is beneficial for generating a response, giving clear context about Speaker B's expertise and prior recommendations, as well as Speaker A's reliance on and reception of these recommendations. Specifically, sentences 1, 2, and 4 give direct insight into the movie recommendation dynamic. Sentence 5 adds depth to Speaker B's background, which might inform the type of recommendations they offer. Sentence 6 also establishes a reference to a specific movie that Speaker A enjoyed, which is relevant for crafting a response related to their movie preferences. While not every sentence is directly related to the context, they are phrased naturally and offer useful cues for continuing the dialogue."
