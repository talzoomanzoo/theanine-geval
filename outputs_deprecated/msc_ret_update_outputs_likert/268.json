Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A. Speaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now? Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done.  Speaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on? Speaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n2. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n3. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n4. Speaker B feels overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and is eager to finish school to escape it.\n5. Both speakers value good grades and believe it can lead to better job opportunities.\n6. Speaker A advises Speaker B to take breaks and prioritize their own happiness and well-being.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that can be useful for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly in understanding Speaker B's perspective. For example, it highlights Speaker B's sports medicine training and pressure to maintain grades, which could frame their empathetic responses regarding exams. The MEMORY also mentions Speaker A's academic struggles, aligning with the dialogue about balancing workload and achieving grades. However, the MEMORY could be more directly connected to the specific details of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the mention of history or English exams. The development or causality of these past interactions isn't clearly demonstrated throughout MEMORY, which would have been helpful for deeper context. Additionally, some sentences are not directly relevant to the ongoing discussion about exams, such as Speaker A excelling in gym and Speaker B's mother running the school. These points contribute to a score of 3, indicating moderate helpfulness but room for improvement in making connections more explicit."
