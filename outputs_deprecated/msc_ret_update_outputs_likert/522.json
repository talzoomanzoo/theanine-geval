    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer? Speaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to? Speaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors? Speaker B: Yes. That way they could have a fireworks show too. I love fireworks. Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods.\n2. Speaker A loves Disney music.\n3. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo.\n4. Speaker B has seen Three Dog Night in concert and enjoys their live shows.\n5. Speaker A is planning to visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend.\n6. Speaker B is waiting for bands to announce their summer tour schedule to plan which shows to attend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "No, I haven't seen the fireworks at the Disney castle, but I've heard they are absolutely magical. I hope to experience it someday. Watching fireworks at a concert sounds like a fantastic combination of music and visual spectacle.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides several relevant points of information that could be useful for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, MEMORY 1 aligns with Speaker A's interest in museums, as mentioned in the context where Speaker A talks about the art museum and impressionist paintings. MEMORY 2 could be slightly relevant given the mention of fireworks at the Disney castle, which connects with Speaker A's love for Disney music. MEMORY 3 and MEMORY 5 provide context for Speaker A's interest in music concerts and museums, respectively. MEMORY 6 touches on Speaker B's planning for concert attendances, which could tie back to their experience with concerts and fireworks shows as mentioned in the dialogue. MEMORY 4, while not directly mentioned in the context, provides background on Speaker B's musical interests, which could enrich the conversation if needed. Overall, the memories are phrased clearly and show connections to the past interactions of the speakers, making them useful for the language model to generate coherent responses. However, not all memories are directly related to the immediate context, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score."
