Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting! Speaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow? Speaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from. Speaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n3. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n4. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n5. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n6. Speaker B is considering giving up their night job to focus on lab work and school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate the vote of confidence! I've actually tried Beyond burgers before and I agree, they're quite close in taste to real beef. It's amazing how far plant-based alternatives have come. I think it's a good option for those looking to reduce their meat consumption.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but also includes details that aren't directly pertinent to the current conversation. Sentences 2, 5, and 6 are somewhat helpful because they establish Speaker B's interest and involvement in lab research, and their academic focus on molecular biologyâ€”both of which are relevant to the discussion about working in the lab and studying. This information can assist in generating a more contextually aware future response from Speaker A. However, sentences 1, 3, and 4 about cooking and dining experiences are not directly related to the cloning conversation and do not provide insightful connections or developments to the current context. These unrelated details make it a bit harder for a language model to determine the most important cues. Despite this, the MEMORY is overall decently structured and offers some relevant insights, hence a score of 3."
