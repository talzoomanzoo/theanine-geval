Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career. Speaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday. Speaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. Speaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach? Speaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option. Speaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like? Speaker B: I love all sorts of history. Right now I am really getting into the weeds of World War II. There's so much to unpack. Speaker A: For sure! So much happened and it really affected how the world is today. I like learning about the history of places where I have lived, it's really interesting.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n3. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n4. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n5. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n6. Speaker B suggests trying the game Elder Scrolls, knowing Speaker A plays World of Warcraft.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's amazing how interconnected everything is when you start delving into history. Have you ever considered incorporating historical elements into your robotics teachings? It could make for some fascinating interdisciplinary lessons.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains mixed relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Points 1 and 3 are quite helpful as they directly relate to the conversation about Speaker B's and Speaker A's teaching interests and background. Point 2 is somewhat relevant since it touches upon Speaker B's academic and career considerations, reflecting the ongoing discussion about career options. Points 4 and 5 provide additional context about Speaker B's value for education and volunteer work, although they do not directly impact the immediate conversation. Point 6 is unrelated to the current dialogue context about teaching and career options. However, overall, the MEMORY is composed of naturally structured sentences, making it easier for a language model to differentiate between helpful and non-helpful information. These attributes justify a mid-range score of 3."
