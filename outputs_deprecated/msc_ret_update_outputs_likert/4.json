Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there? Speaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay? Speaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately? Speaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n2. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n3. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n4. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n5. Speaker A, a retired librarian, recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit.\n6. Speaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds fascinating! \"The Gettysburg Campaign\" must have been quite insightful. I'll have to add it to my reading list. I appreciate the recommendation.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information that could have some relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, the reference to Speaker B's adventurous spring break plans (1) aligns with the conversation about traveling to Costa Rica. Additionally, the fact that Speaker B has not started packing for their trip (2) could be useful information for generating a response related to travel preparation. However, some of the memories do not directly connect to the dialogue, such as the mention of Easter weekend excitement (3) or the new car (6), which do not seem directly relevant to the current context. While some memories relate to books and reading (4, 5), they aren't very aligned with the specific book discussion in the dialogue. Overall, MEMORY provides a mix of somewhat relevant and tangential information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it moderately helpful."
