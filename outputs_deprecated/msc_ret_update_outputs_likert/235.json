Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended.  Speaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along! Speaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them. Speaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me! Speaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n2. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n3. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot.\n4. Speaker A's parrot Tasha has seen cats before and ignores them.\n5. Speaker B lives in the city they grew up in, loves animals, and has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n6. Speaker B has an older mellow cat and is concerned about training the new energetic kittens.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I totally get that! Fall is the perfect time for hiking - cool weather and no bugs to bother you. I can't wait for the season to change so I can hit the trails without feeling like a snack for mosquitoes.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Points 1 and 2 are relevant as they mention Speaker A's interest in adopting a rescue kitten and their pet parrot Tasha, which are directly related to the conversation about adopting kittens and the interaction with the parrot. However, the information is somewhat redundant as both points convey similar ideas. Point 4 could be helpful context about Tasha ignoring cats, but it conflicts with the dialogue context where Speaker A expresses uncertainty about the parrot and the cat's interactions. Point 3 is not relevant to the conversation since there's no mention in the dialogue of Speaker A looking for training tips. \n\nThe points related to Speaker B (5 and 6) do not directly connect with the immediate context regarding hiking or the kitten names. But they do offer additional character background that can help indirectly in understanding the broader context or future interactions. Despite some relevance, the lack of a clear and structured development of ideas in the MEMORY results in a score slightly above average."
