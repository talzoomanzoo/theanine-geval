Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment.  Speaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon? Speaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think? Speaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus! Speaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing? Speaker A: Yea, I think for the more complicated origami it's kind of a use it or lose it but for the simple stuff you can usually take a couple months of and still remember to do it! Did you see origami in Japan? Speaker B: Not up close, but I noticed a lot in shop windows in certain areas. I love Japan -- they're so welcoming. One of our acquaintances GAVE me a kimono. She said it's customary to try to share their culture. Kind of different from America in my opinion.   Speaker A: Oh, that sounds wonderful. It's impressive how much things that came from there and how giving a culture they are. America is definetly a lot different from them, have you visted different states in America?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A wishes to visit the country where origami was originally created, possibly Japan.\n2. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n3. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n4. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n5. Speaker B has visited Japan and found it to be an amazing country.\n6. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that can aid in generating a proper next response. Here is the breakdown of the helpfulness of each memory point:\n\n1. The first point about Speaker A wishing to visit Japan isn't directly relevant to the current dialogue. However, it indirectly aligns with Speaker B's experience and appreciation of Japan, which is mentioned in the dialogue. \n\n2. The fact that Speaker A learned origami by themselves (point 2) isn't mentioned in the current dialogue but could be useful background knowledge for understanding Speaker A's skill level and passion for origami.\n\n3. Point 3 is somewhat helpful, as Speaker A's success with a Lotus flower relates to their origami skills and interests, providing context for their achievements and cultural interests.\n\n4. Point 4, which mentions Speaker A offering to teach Speaker B origami, directly relates to the dialogue, corroborating Speaker B's request for A to teach them origami.\n\n5. Point 5 aligns well with the dialogue context, noting that Speaker B has visited Japan and found it amazing, which matches with their expressed fondness for Japan in the dialogue.\n\n6. Point 6 could be slightly confusing, as Speaker A is mentioned to have already made a Lotus flower successfully in point 3. This contradiction could hinder understanding of the past interactions.\n\nOverall, MEMORY points are somewhat relevant to the current dialogue and go hand in hand with speakers' interactions but lack clarity and straightforwardness in content and organization to deserve a higher rating."
