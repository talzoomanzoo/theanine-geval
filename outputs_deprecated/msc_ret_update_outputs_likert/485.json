Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone?  Speaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!). Speaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol Speaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you. Speaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up? Speaker B: Nope, I just cleared my schedule until the Alps marathon that you're training for. It's just you and me until you break that finish line. I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up. Speaker A: Wow 4 am.  Is it too late to change my mind?lol Speaker B: Yes. We have an iron-clad written agreement. Tell me how I'm doing so far. Is this the most motivated you've ever been in your entire life? Speaker A: No, but that's why I have you.  You're going to push me to do the things I can't bring myself to do.  I'll have more motivation tomorrow.  Today was a long work day.lol Speaker B: I'm going to try a new motivational technique with you. Would you be more frightened by a spider or a snake. I need to know before we meet up this weekend. Speaker A: A spider no question but if you ask me to hold one I'm definitely running away.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n2. Speaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\n3. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety.\n4. Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\n5. Speaker B is considering running a marathon and mentioned fishing and feeling depressed.\n6. Speaker A is training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "**Helpfulness Score: 3**\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant points for understanding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it could be more cohesive and better connected to specific parts of the dialogue. Here are a few specific observations:\n\n1. The MEMORY mentions that Speaker B is a motivational speaker (points 2 and 4), which aligns with the context where Speaker B offers motivational techniques and supportive messages.\n\n2. The element where Speaker B needed motivation themselves due to depression and anxiety could potentially play a role in understanding Speaker Bâ€™s empathy and approach (point 3).\n\n3. There is a clear mention that Speaker A is training for marathons and seeking recovery advice (point 6), which aligns with the dialogue about Speaker A training for the Alps marathon.\n\nHowever, there are gaps and somewhat disjointed information:\n\n- Some elements like meeting at the beach for training (point 1) are not connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where specific locations or times for meetings are not discussed in the dialogue.\n  \n- Mention of fishing and feeling depressed (point 5) seems less relevant to the ongoing motivational context in the dialogue.\n\n- Point 5 also mentions Speaker B considering running a marathon, but this is not strongly linked to Speaker B's current role as a motivational figure, focusing instead on motivating Speaker A.\n\nThe MEMORY provides a few useful pieces of information but could benefit from more clear and direct connections between the memories and the ongoing dialogue."
