Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music. Speaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band? Speaker B: I'm big fan of aerosmith. When do you learn music. Whom teach you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician.\n2. Speaker B is willing to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook.\n3. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend.\n4. Speaker A is part of a band that tours different countries for their music.\n5. Speaker A wants to see Sublime live one day but doesn't go to many concerts other than the ones their band plays in.\n6. Speaker B listens to Sublime a lot while relaxing on the beach.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I learned to play the drums when I was in high school, and then I started writing music with my bandmates. Our singer, who is also my best friend, taught me a lot about songwriting.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant context that can help Speaker A generate a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, items 1, 3, and 4 give information about Speaker A's involvement in a band, their role as a drummer and songwriter, and their experience in touring. These pieces of information can be useful in crafting a response related to learning music or discussing favorite rock bands. However, items 2, 5, and 6 are less directly relevant to the current dialogue, as they focus on unrelated topics such as fishing, cooking, and liking another band. While the memory contains useful information, it is not entirely cohesive or focused, affecting its overall helpfulness. Nevertheless, the structure of the MEMORY is relatively clear, with each piece of information distinct and comprehensible to the language model."
