Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n2. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n3. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n4. Speaker A has given a pressure cooker as a gift and uses it for recipes like lamb shanks.\n5. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n6. Speaker B's husband is a great cook and Speaker B is not skilled in cooking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great, thank you! I'll definitely give it a try. I think my husband will be impressed with my new cooking skills.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys Asian food, which connects to Speaker A's suggestion about recipes and the use of a pressure cooker. Additionally, it highlights Speaker B's interest in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker, aligning with Speaker A's approach to sharing beginner recipes. The MEMORY also notes Speaker A's own experience and recommendations regarding the pressure cooker, offering Speaker B useful guidance. The details about Speaker A gifting a pressure cooker and recommending it for its efficiency add context to their interaction. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured and demonstrates a clear development of past interactions between the speakers, providing contextual cues that are beneficial for generating a response in the dialogue context."
