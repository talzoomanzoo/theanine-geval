    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast. Speaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project. Speaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on? Speaker B: I'm sure the student appreciate that. You teach as a group as apposed to one-on-one right? And one of the companies I work for had their system hit with a virus so I've been upgraded their software to debug the system.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\n2. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it.\n3. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things.\n4. Speaker A is a martial arts teacher and student and is pursuing an athletic training degree in college.\n5. Speaker B is busy debugging software and is a runner.\n6. Speaker A is a college student who teaches jiu-jitsu and is lactose intolerant.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Teaching in a group setting can be really rewarding. It sounds like you have your hands full with debugging the software. Hopefully, you can squash those bugs quickly and get everything back on track for the company.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides solid contextual information that aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context discusses martial arts, both as a class Speaker A attended and in relation to Speaker A's teaching style, while Speaker B mentions working on software. The MEMORY reveals relevant points: 1) both speakers have an interest in martial arts (sentences 1, 2, 3), which is pertinent since the conversation focuses on martial arts classes and teaching. 2) Speaker A is a martial arts teacher (sentence 4), which directly relates to the context where Speaker A attends a martial arts class. 3) Additionally, it clarifies that Speaker A is also a student pursuing a degree and lactose intolerant (sentence 6), creating a more developed background for Speaker A. 4) Information about Speaker B's work in software (sentence 1, 5) connects to Speaker B debugging software in the context. Although the MEMORY includes tangential details like Speaker A being lactose intolerant or Speaker B being a runner, it is structured well enough to align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and provides a comprehensive understanding of both speakers to the language model. However, not all provided information is directly leveraged or required in the conversation, so the rating is a 4."
