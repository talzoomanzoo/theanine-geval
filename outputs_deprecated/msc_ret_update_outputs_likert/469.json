Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it? Speaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see.  Speaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself? Speaker B: I was in Greece last two years ago.   I am excited to go again soon!    At somepoint I would like to take a cruise around the islands there.  It seems like a neat way to see all the Islands in an easy way.   Have you ever taken a cruise? Speaker A: Only once before when I was very young, so I don't remember much. It sounds like such a relaxing way to enjoy the day, though. Maybe we can plan a cruise together sometime. Speaker B: That would be fun!  I go to Europe a lot so maybe a cruise in the Caribbean would be nice.  I would like to see Saint Lucia and Saint Thomas. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece.\n2. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five.\n3. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\n4. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian.\n5. Speaker A has traveled around Europe before, visiting capital cities of each country.\n6. Speaker B asks Speaker A if their trip is more for relaxation or sightseeing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a fantastic idea! The Caribbean islands have such beautiful beaches and crystal clear waters. A cruise there would be a great mix of relaxation and exploration. Let's definitely plan that out for our next adventure.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information, but it lacks a clear connection to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance:\n\n- Sentence 1 mentions the Parthenon and Acropolis of Athens, which is somewhat related since the Acropolis is specifically mentioned in the dialogue. However, the beach on Corfu Island is unrelated to the current discussion about Athens.\n- Sentences 2 and 3 discuss Speaker B's upcoming trip, which might inform Speaker A about Speaker B's plans, but doesn’t align with the main focus of the dialogue (the Acropolis and the cruise discussion).\n- Sentence 4 states that Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time, which contradicts the dialogue where Speaker B mentions having visited Greece two years ago. Hence, it is potentially misleading.\n- Sentence 5 about Speaker A’s previous travels is not immediately relevant to the current dialogue, which focuses on Greece and the cruise idea.\n- Sentence 6 is entirely unrelated to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT and doesn’t contribute helpful information.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY includes some information that might be relevant, but it is either not directly aligned with the conversation or lacks structured connection to enhance the model's response generation, hence the score of 2."
