Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend.

Did you use a season pass for the zoo or just a one time ticket? Speaker B: One time. I was just there visititng family. What is your favorite zoo to visit?\n\nMEMORY:\n1.

    "raw_prediction": "My favorite zoo to visit is the San Diego Zoo. It's such a wonderful place with a wide variety of animals to see. Have you been there before?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information that may be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, the memory reflects Speaker A's enjoyment of visiting zoos and mentions big cities, which aligns with their comment on the Bronx Zoo being one of the best in the country. Additionally, there is mention of Speaker B's child wanting to visit the zoo, which can correlate with the ongoing conversation about zoos in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, some entries such as memories about discount finding from Speaker B do not immediately tie into the current dialogue. Moreover, the phrasing and structure could be more directly connected to the conversation, as some memories don't clearly provide context or development for future interactions. The MEMORY provides some context and development, making it moderately helpful without being completely aligned or naturally phrased in regards to the current Dialogue Context."
