Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone?  Speaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!). Speaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\n2. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n3. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety.\n4. Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\n5. Speaker A is training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover.\n6. Speaker B is considering running a marathon and mentioned fishing and feeling depressed.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides quite a bit of helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around Speaker B's motivational speaking and running, which is well represented in the MEMORY. Sentences 1, 2, and 4 directly relate to Speaker B's role as a motivational speaker, aligning with their current conversational application to motivate Speaker A. Sentence 2 also connects the dialogue to running, which is relevant as Speaker A discusses motivation to run. Sentences 3 and 6 provide background to Speaker B's personal motivations, adding depth to their character, but are less directly connected to the dialogue. However, these sentences are naturally structured, making it easy to identify their relevance or lack thereof to the current dialogue. Overall, the MEMORY is well-connected and helps in understanding the context for future dialogue contributions by Speaker B."
