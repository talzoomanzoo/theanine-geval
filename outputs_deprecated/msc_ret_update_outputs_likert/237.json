Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended.  Speaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along! Speaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them. Speaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me! Speaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler. Speaker B: Ah yes, that's my favorite time of year. Oh and speaking of Tasha, I'm still amazed she knows Mandarin. Have you been learning more of the language? Speaker A: I've been learning a little more. I try to learn a few things a day. Tasha's reactions to my talking to myself in Mandarin is funny, she looks confused most of the time.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n2. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n3. Speaker A's parrot Tasha has seen cats before and ignores them.\n4. Speaker A has been learning Mandarin and Tasha has started saying Chinese phrases instead of English ones.\n5. Speaker B finds it amusing that Tasha speaks Mandarin and mutters things under her breath.\n6. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's adorable! Maybe Tasha thinks you're teaching her new phrases. It's fascinating how pets pick up on our habits. Who knows, maybe she'll start responding in Mandarin too!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a useful background for the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures details about Speaker A's parrot named Tasha, her history with kittens, as well as both speakers' anecdotes regarding Mandarin, which are relevant to the contextual discussion. Sentences 1, 4, 5, and 6 align well with the conversation, detailing Speaker A's interest in adopting a rescue kitten, their mutual interest in Tasha's language abilities, and previous interactions with kittens. However, Sentence 2 introduces an unrelated detail about Speaker B considering Mandarin names, which wasn't mentioned or connected in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, thus impacting the score slightly. Overall, MEMORY effectively supports the conversation by providing pertinent background information while maintaining factual relevance and logical flow."
