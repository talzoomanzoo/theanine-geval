Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim.  Speaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you  Speaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. Speaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you? Speaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it. Speaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car? Speaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming. Speaker A: That would be great too. I like to program in several different languages. Do you have a preference? Speaker B: No, I'm just getting started so I don't have a preference. Maybe you could show me what you prefer and we could start there.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n2. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n4. Speaker B is interested in learning programming and is already practicing.\n5. Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and has signed up for several trips.\n6. Speaker A enjoys the food and the adventure of cruises.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Sure, I'd be happy to show you some different programming languages. We can start with something beginner-friendly like Python or JavaScript. Once you get the hang of it, we can explore more advanced languages together. It's going to be a fun learning journey!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information but lacks depth and accuracy in certain areas. Sentence 1 accurately reflects a significant part of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and program. Sentence 3 is somewhat pertinent, as there is a brief exchange about the potential of going on a cruise together. However, Sentence 2 is inaccurately conveying that Speaker B enjoys punk music specifically for swimming and learning programming, which wasn't explicitly mentioned in the dialogue. Furthermore, Sentences 4 and 5 do not align well with the current dialogue; there's no mention of Speaker B already practicing programming or Speaker A planning a snorkeling trip, and these pieces of information are irrelevant to the immediate flow of conversation. Sentence 6 mentions Speaker A's enjoyment of food and adventure on cruises, which is not expressed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, the MEMORY provides some helpful information but also contains irrelevant and inaccurately represented details, making it moderately helpful."
