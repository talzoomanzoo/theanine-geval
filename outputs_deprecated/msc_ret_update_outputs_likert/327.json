Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment.  Speaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon? Speaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n2. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n3. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n4. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n5. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n6. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's great to hear that you're interested in learning origami! I personally find it to be a mix of both easy and challenging. Some designs can be quite simple once you get the hang of the basic folds, while others require more intricate techniques and precision. But with practice and patience, I'm sure you'll enjoy the process of creating your own origami animals.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating the next response in the dialogue context. The MEMORY confirms that Speaker A enjoys origami, which ties into the context of them having won the 3rd place prize. It also notes that Speaker A has offered to teach Speaker B origami, which is directly relevant since Speaker B expressed interest in learning. However, some details seem redundant or slightly conflicting (such as the mention of attempting a lotus next in contrast to having made one successfully). Additionally, not all details are directly relevant to the current topic of their conversation (such as Speaker A's volunteering and Speaker B's interest in origami animals). Overall, the MEMORY contains useful elements, but they could be more coherent and aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, resulting in a moderate helpfulness rating."
