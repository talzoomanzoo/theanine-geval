Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career. Speaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday. Speaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n3. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n4. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n5. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n6. Speaker A is involved with a football league and is looking forward to playing games.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe MEMORY provides several useful pieces of information to a language model for generating a relevant next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Here are the key aspects:\n\n1. Sentence (1) directly relates to Speaker A's interest in teaching robotics, which aligns with the context of possibly pursuing teaching as a career option. This connection is beneficial for generating responses.\n\n2. Sentence (2) gives insight into Speaker B's future academic and career aspirations, which is relevant since the DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on career discussions. It adds depth to understanding Speaker B's perspective.\n\n3. Sentence (3) about Speaker B's study in linguistics and feeling limited by job opportunities provides context for their stress and decision-making process mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\n4. Sentence (4) offers additional context about Speaker B's involvement in education, reiterating their commitment and potential fit for a teaching role, which is part of the ongoing conversation.\n\n5. Sentence (5) strengthens the understanding of shared values between Speakers A and B, making it easier for the model to generate interactions based on mutual respect for education.\n\n6. Sentence (6) does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but is naturally phrased and does not hinder extraction of relevant data for generating responses.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY offers a coherent set of information regarding the backgrounds and interests of both speakers that aids in response generation based on the context. However, not every sentence is directly linked to the current discussion, slightly reducing its overall helpfulness."
