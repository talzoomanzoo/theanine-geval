Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n2. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n3. Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets.\n4. Speaker B likes poetry and fantasy books, and has a pet cat.\n5. Speaker B's girlfriend has a cockatoo that makes a lot of noise.\n6. Speaker A has a sister who owns a corgi.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information regarding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically, sentences 1 and 4 indicate Speaker B's interest in kittens and cats, which directly relates to the question asked by Speaker A. These sentences provide helpful context about Speaker B's potential decision to adopt a kitten. However, the other sentences, while offering some insights into the interests and pet preferences of both speakers, are not directly connected to the current conversation about adopting a kitten. Additionally, the MEMORY lacks a natural development or connection between the sentences, making it slightly challenging to draw direct relevancy to the current dialogue. Therefore, it is somewhat helpful but not optimally structured or focused on the relevant context."
