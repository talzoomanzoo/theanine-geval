Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes? Speaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate.\n2. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.\n3. Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both have interests in learning new languages.\n5. Speaker A is taking a French class and plans to learn French to dig for clams in Quebec.\n6. Speaker B enjoys water-related activities and movies like \"Jaws\".\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Considering your interest in martial arts and background in football, I would recommend trying out Taekwondo. It involves a lot of dynamic kicking techniques which might resonate with your football footwork skills. Plus, it's a great way to challenge yourself and learn something new!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it highlights Speaker B's background in karate and mentions that they hold a green belt (#2), which could be useful for advising Speaker A on martial arts classes. The connection between football and karate footwork (#3) might also offer an interesting angle if Speaker A has a similar background. However, other details in the MEMORY, such as Speaker A's interest in learning French or Speaker B's enjoyment of water-related activities and movies like \"Jaws,\" do not directly contribute to the topic of martial arts and could be distracting. The MEMORY contains a mix of relevant and irrelevant information, with reasonable cohesion, leading to a mid-range score."
