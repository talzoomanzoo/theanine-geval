Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n2. Speaker A leads hikes for the group they camp with, which are usually an hour or two long.\n3. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n4. Speaker A is nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes.\n5. Speaker B shared tips on repelling mosquitos using sprays with 20% DEET and other active ingredients.\n6. Speaker A enjoys hiking, birdwatching, and spotting rare animals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's great that you're getting out there and leading hikes for your friends, even if they tire out quickly. Maybe you can gradually build up their stamina and get them excited about longer hikes!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY entries provide relevant information that can aid the language model in generating a suitable response. Specifically, entries 1 and 2 give insights into Speaker B's hiking experiences and Speaker A's role as a hiking leader, adding context to their current conversation about hiking and repellent. Entry 5 directly connects to the dialogue context as Speaker B apparently offered advice on mosquito repellent, complementing the ongoing discussion. Entries 3, 4, and 6, while not directly tied to the current dialogue, enrich understanding of Speaker A's interests and plans, which may be indirectly referenced if the conversation turns to future hiking plans or shared interests. Overall, the MEMORY consists of informative and cohesive sentences that improve understanding of both speakers' backgrounds and relevance to the current topic while being organized naturally."
