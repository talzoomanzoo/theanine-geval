Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.\n2. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate.\n3. Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both have interests in learning new languages.\n5. Speaker B enjoys water-related activities and movies like \"Jaws\".\n6. Speaker A is taking a French class and plans to learn French to dig for clams in Quebec.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I've also dabbled in Taekwondo and Jiu-Jitsu before focusing on Karate. It's been a great journey exploring different disciplines.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information that could be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly Speaker B's involvement in Karate and their background in football, which are martial arts-related. However, the MEMORY also includes many details that are not directly helpful or related to the specific question posed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, information about Speaker B considering going back to school for IT, their enjoyment of water-related activities, and Speaker A's interest in learning French are not relevant to the question about other martial arts. Additionally, the organization and flow of the MEMORY could be improved to highlight the connections and development of martial arts topics between the speakers. The current structure doesn't clearly prioritize or provide coherent transitions that aid in generating a more targeted response."
