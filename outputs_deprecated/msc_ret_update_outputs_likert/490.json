Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work? Speaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol Speaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n3. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n4. Speaker A will use the money earned from the store to buy the hammock online.\n5. Speaker B's neighbor, John, is getting divorced and selling top-of-the-line camping gear.\n6. Speaker A plans to bring sandwiches and fruit for the hike, specifically asking about veggie sandwiches for Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm still figuring that out. I've been exploring different options and trying to see what really interests me. John's divorce has given me a glimpse into how unpredictable life can be, so I want to make sure whatever I choose brings me joy and stability. It's all about finding that balance, right? How about you, any long-term career goals or just taking it day by day?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several pieces of information that help a language model understand the context and Speaker A's situation better. For instance, the detail about Speaker A applying to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail (1) adds context to why they might love the store's location mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Memory point 2 supports Speaker A's positive impression of the store environment by mentioning that a friend of Speaker B also worked there and enjoyed it. Speaker B's work situation with their neighbor John (point 5) connects to the dialogue where they talk about earning money through side projects. While not all memory points are directly relevant to generating a response, such as saving for a hammock or the divorce details of Speaker B's neighbor, they are naturally phrased and can be easily identified as less relevant to the immediate conversation. Overall, the memory supports understanding past interactions and provides helpful context clues relevant to the dialogue."
