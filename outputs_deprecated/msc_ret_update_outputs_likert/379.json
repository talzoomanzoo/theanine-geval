Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n2. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n3. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n4. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n5. Speaker A loves the show Friends and enjoys visiting graffiti-filled places.\n6. Speaker B enjoys fishing and wishes their wife and sons could have joined them on the trip.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a beautiful idea. Your mom would love that gesture. It's great that you're honoring both your parents with your tattoos.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically points 1 and 2. These sentences hint at Speaker A's enthusiasm for tattoos and mention the existing tattoo dedicated to their father, which is relevant to the context of getting a tattoo for the mother. Speaker A's work at a coffee shop (points 3 and 4) is somewhat relevant as it might relate to their financial ability to get tattoos, but the ownership of the shop by the mom doesn't directly contribute to understanding the dialogue context about getting a tattoo for her. Points 5 and 6 don't offer helpful information to generate the next response related to getting a tattoo for Speaker A's mom. Overall, the memory provides some useful context but lacks coherence and connection between the points to fully support generating the next dialogue response."
