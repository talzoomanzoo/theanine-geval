Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim.  Speaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you  Speaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. Speaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n2. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n4. Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and has signed up for several trips.\n5. Speaker A plans to travel to the Caribbean for their next trip.\n6. Speaker B is afraid of cruises because they can't swim.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "No, I haven't been to the Caribbean. It sounds amazing, but I'm still a bit hesitant about cruises because I can't swim.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:  \n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information regarding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's enjoyment of punk music, the swimming lesson, and the discussion of a cruise (Points 1, 2, and 3). This information is helpful for generating a response related to Speaker B's interest in music and swimming lessons. However, the MEMORY also includes conflicting or not entirely relevant information such as Speaker B being afraid of cruises because they can't swim (Point 6), which contradicts the dialogue where Speaker B expresses interest in a cruise. The MEMORY also includes information about snorkeling trips (Point 4), which is not discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and does not contribute to the dialogue's main themes. This disrupts the natural connection and clarity needed for development, causality, and relevancy related to the conversation. A clearer structure and stronger relevancy of details to the current context would have improved the score."
