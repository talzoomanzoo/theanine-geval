    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it? Speaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see.  Speaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself? Speaker B: I was in Greece last two years ago.   I am excited to go again soon!    At somepoint I would like to take a cruise around the islands there.  It seems like a neat way to see all the Islands in an easy way.   Have you ever taken a cruise? Speaker A: Only once before when I was very young, so I don't remember much. It sounds like such a relaxing way to enjoy the day, though. Maybe we can plan a cruise together sometime. Speaker B: That would be fun!  I go to Europe a lot so maybe a cruise in the Caribbean would be nice.  I would like to see Saint Lucia and Saint Thomas.  Speaker A: Oh, Europe? I'm already sold on the idea, sounds like a blast! I've never had a negative experience in Europe. Should we visit some of the capital cities? Speaker B: I would like to go to Paris.  Since I live in Amsterdam I could take the train down.  I have seen much and Italy and Greece but would love to go to Paris.  Have you been there before?  Speaker A: Only once, and I had a really great time there. The buildings were so beautiful and the food was delicious. Do you like French food? Speaker B: I do like French food- but it is very rich.  I especially love French desserts like macarons.   I would like to see the museums in Paris. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has traveled around Europe before, visiting capital cities of each country.\n2. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\n3. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five.\n4. Speaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece.\n5. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian.\n6. Speaker B asks Speaker A if their trip is more for relaxation or sightseeing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "The museums in Paris are incredible, you'll love exploring them. The Louvre is a must-visit, and the Musee d'Orsay is fantastic for art lovers. Paris is truly a city filled with history and culture. I hope you get to experience it soon!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides limited helpful information that connects with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. Sentence 1 somewhat aligns with the ongoing conversation about European travel, especially because Speaker A mentions having a great time in Europe, however it slightly misrepresents the context as it claims Speaker A has traveled around Europe visiting capital cities, while the context only mentions Paris. \n   \n2. Sentences 2, 3, and 4 discuss Speaker B's future trip to Greece, which could be relevant to the conversation about visiting Greece, but they don't provide any direct connection or additional value to the current dialogue topics. Additionally, the MEMORY erroneously mentions Speaker B's excitement about visiting Greece for the first time, which contradicts the context where Speaker B mentions having visited Greece two years ago.\n\n3. Sentence 5 introduces an additional topic about Athena and being a librarian, which isnâ€™t related to the current dialogue and doesn't aid in crafting a response.\n\n4. Sentence 6 introduces a potentially relevant question about the purpose of Speaker A's trip, which could relate to the sightseeing aspect mentioned in the dialogue, but it wasn't mentioned in the current dialogue context. \n\nOverall, while there is some potential help with the travel-related content (notably in sentence 1), the MEMORY mainly contains irrelevant or inaccurately connected information, limiting its usefulness for generating a coherent next response in the dialogue context."
