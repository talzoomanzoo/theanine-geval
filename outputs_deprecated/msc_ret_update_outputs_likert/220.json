Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food? Speaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid.\n2. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature.\n3. Speaker B has two terrier dogs as pets.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for music and plan to have a house concert with their pets.\n5. Speaker B asks Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before.\n6. Speaker A has a pet raccoon and has a friend who found baby raccoons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some background information about Speaker A and Speaker B, such as the fact that Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and dogs, which is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where issues with pets getting into food are being discussed. However, the MEMORY does not offer any detailed past interactions or relevant development between the speakers that would aid Speaker B in generating a response in the given context. The MEMORY's information is fragmented and lacks a clear structure or causality that connects it to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, the mention of the bearded dragon, the house concert, and the bearded dragon do not seem relevant or helpful in providing context for the current dialogue about pets getting into food. The memory is not phrased in a way that makes it easy for a language model to identify directly useful information for the present conversation."
