Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice.  Speaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with? Speaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think? Speaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point. Speaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.   Speaker B: I didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n2. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n3. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n4. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n5. Speaker A has given a pressure cooker as a gift and uses it for recipes like lamb shanks.\n6. Speaker B's husband is a great cook and Speaker B is not skilled in cooking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Cooking the rice beforehand allows it to cool and dry out slightly, which helps prevent it from becoming too sticky when you fry it. It's a common technique in fried rice recipes to achieve that perfect texture. Plus, using your own fresh eggs will definitely add a delicious touch to the dish!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information that helps understand the context of the dialogue. It mentions that Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food (Memory 1), which aligns with the dialogue's discussion on Asian recipes. It also clarifies that Speaker B is not skilled in cooking but is interested in learning about it (Memory 2 and 6), providing a clearer background on their motivations. Moreover, it highlights Speaker A's experience and recommendations with the pressure cooker, tying into their suggestions in the conversation (Memory 3, 4, and 5). However, MEMORY could be improved with more direct connections to the ongoing dialogue's specifics, such as the discussion on eggs and why rice may need to be cooked beforehand. This lack of specific ties results in a mid-range score, as the MEMORY is generally helpful but not exceptionally detailed or directly tied to the current conversation."
