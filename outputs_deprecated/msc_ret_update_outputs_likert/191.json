Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make? Speaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it. Speaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too? Speaker B: Yeah definitely! I know you like hot foods, so if you learn and can make them fresh it will taste amazing. Have you tried any new foods lately? Speaker A: Not any new foods, but I did try a new food truck near me that was delicious! It was street tacos and you could pick from barbacoa, chicken, and steak for the protein. Do you like Mexican food?  Speaker B: Oh god I do love Mexican food. That was be so hard to pick because they're all so good! Did they have al pastor by any chance? I loved marinated pork tacos. Speaker A: unfortunately no, but I can ask them if they plan to get it in the future. I had one of each and they were all good in their own way. Have you ever had Birra tacos? I'd love to try those next.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\n2. Speaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally.\n3. Speaker A plays the drums and loves making food for others.\n4. Speaker A enjoys cooking and finds it helpful for stress relief.\n5. Speaker A cooked steak, fried potatoes, and shrimp for dinner with their father.\n6. Speaker A enjoys surfing and offers to give Speaker B lessons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Birria tacos are amazing! The flavorful meat and melted cheese make them so delicious. If you're up for it, we can try making them together sometime. It's a fun dish to cook and perfect for a cozy night in.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant details about Speaker B's and Speaker A's cooking preferences and habits, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT wherein both speakers are discussing cooking and food preferences. Sentences 1 and 2 provide context about both speakers' interest in cooking, which can aid the language model in forming a response that acknowledges their shared enthusiasm for cooking. Sentence 4 particularly highlights Speaker A's enjoyment of cooking as a stress-relief activity, which adds depth to their character. However, some details, such as Sentence 3 about Speaker A playing the drums and Sentence 6 about surfing, are not directly related to the current dialogue context and do not provide helpful cues for generating the next response. Therefore, while the MEMORY is somewhat relevant and provides some context, it lacks a clear connection to the specific details discussed in the dialogue about Mexican foods and new dishes, thus meriting a score of 3."
