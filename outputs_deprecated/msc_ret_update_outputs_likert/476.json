    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone?  Speaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\n2. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety.\n3. Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\n4. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n5. Speaker A is training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover.\n6. Speaker B is considering running a marathon and mentioned fishing and feeling depressed.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fantastic to hear! Your passion for motivating others really shines through. With your enthusiasm and energy, I have no doubt you would make an excellent motivational speaker for my friend. Let's set up a meeting to discuss the details and get them back on track with their running goals.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided is highly relevant and helpful for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory entries clearly outline the connection and past interactions between Speakers A and B: \n\n1. Speaker B's profession as a motivational speaker (memory 1) is directly related to the discussion about motivating others to run.\n2. The fact that Speaker B uses their experience with depression and anxiety as motivation in their career (memory 2) enhances the authenticity and credibility as a motivational speaker, which may resonate with Speaker A's need for motivation.\n3. The mention of Speaker B’s job role (memory 3) directly ties into Speaker A’s request for a motivational speaker.\n4. The past invitation from Speaker A to train together for a marathon (memory 4) provides a direct link, shows shared interests and potential experience Speaker B might have discussed during the speech.\n5. Speaker A's interest in marathon training and recovery advice (memory 5) connects to the current context, as motivation is likely to be sought.\n6. The mention of Speaker B's consideration to run a marathon (memory 6) aligns with Speaker A’s context, upgrading their relevance with a common goal and shared challenge.\n\nEach memory statement is naturally phrased, contextually relevant, and demonstrates a clear development of past interactions, making it easy for the language model to utilize them effectively."
