Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. Speaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price? Speaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music Speaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it. Speaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately? Speaker B: No I haven't! I keep hoping that I will so I can buy my dreamhouse but I know the chances are low. Speaker A: Would you move to the city? It'd be too much for me Speaker B: I would love to be able to have a country house and a city house to be able to come and go to each one as I please. doesn't that sound like a dream come true? Speaker A: It would be convenient for seeing concerts in the city, yes. I'm not used to the business, though Speaker B: Yeah I understand that. Have you listened to any new blues songs lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n3. Both speakers dream of having a city and country house or a summer and winter home.\n4. Speaker B appreciates the convenience of city living but also values what the country has to offer.\n5. Both speakers acknowledge the pros and cons of city and country living.\n6. Speaker B bought 20 lotto tickets with the same numbers, aiming to get a bigger share of the jackpot if they win.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I have! I discovered a new artist that I've been really into. It's been a nice escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY is generally helpful, as it encapsulates past interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B that relate to their discussions on the lottery and living in the city or the country. This information is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where both speakers discuss their dreams of acquiring a city and country house, ideal living situations, and hopes from the lottery. The MEMORY also provides past strategies on playing the lottery, thus offering helpful context for generating responses related to their dreams and lotteries. Moreover, the memory helps the language model identify important contextual cues such as Speaker Bâ€™s specific strategy regarding lotto numbers, even though it's not directly addressed in the dialogue context. However, one could argue about the relevance of some specific details like Speaker B buying 20 tickets, which might be superfluous if the conversation doesn't steer in that direction explicitly. Nonetheless, the MEMORY provides detailed reflections of the dialogue context effectively, making it overall helpful for response generation."
