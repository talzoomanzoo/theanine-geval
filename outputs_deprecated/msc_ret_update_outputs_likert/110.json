Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n2. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n3. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n4. Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n5. Speaker A enjoys the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it.\n6. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's awesome! I can't wait to see the new dish. Maybe next time I visit your restaurant, I'll have to try it out too.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information that enhances the understanding of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. In particular, sentences 1, 2, and 4 provide context about Speaker A's work at the restaurant, including perks they receive (free meals, leftovers), their work schedule, and their experiences at the restaurant. Sentence 1 is particularly relevant as it relates directly to Speaker A's excitement about trying their favorite dish for free. Sentence 3, while not directly connected to the dialogue context, indicates a previous invitation by Speaker A which helps build their relationship's background. Sentence 5 provides insight into Speaker A's enjoyment of their job. Sentence 6 is less relevant in this context as it pertains more to Speaker B's interests. Overall, the memory provides a well-rounded background on Speaker A's work life, which is helpful in understanding their enthusiasm in the dialogue."
