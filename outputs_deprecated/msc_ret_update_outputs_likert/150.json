Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping? Speaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp? Speaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer? Speaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping? Speaker B: We usually do tents but we have camped in yurts too. Did you go to the zoo last weekend? Speaker A: I see. Yes, I did make it to the zoo.  Have you gone to your local zoo? Speaker B: I went to the Bronx zoo it was amazing! Did you get to see Joshua?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n2. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys.\n3. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n4. Speaker A has a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo, particularly to see the tiger named Joshua.\n5. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n6. Speaker A suggests taking the pets to the zoo and mentions that most major cities have good zoos.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I did! Joshua was looking majestic as always. Have you ever taken your daughter to see the tigers at the zoo?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly the mention of Speaker A's interest in zoos and the specific references to the tiger named Joshua. This could be helpful in generating a response to Speaker B's question about seeing Joshua. Additionally, the MEMORY indicates that Speaker B is a parent with a child interested in visiting the zoo, which aligns with the dialogue about camping and going to the zoo. However, several sentences in the MEMORY, such as those about seeing tigers and monkeys, Speaker A's kitten, and the mention of major cities having good zoos, provide little contextual benefit for the current conversation and make it only moderately helpful. Overall, while some MEMORY elements are relevant and naturally phrased, others are less beneficial for generating a future dialogue response, leading to a middle-of-the-road score."
