    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week? Speaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you? Speaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n3. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n4. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n5. Speaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy playing video games in their free time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "How about trying out something like Stardew Valley or Minecraft? They are both very relaxing and enjoyable without any jump scares or intense moments. Plus, we could even play together if you're up for it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains comprehensive and relevant information about the interests and preferences of both speakers concerning video games, specifically Resident Evil, which is directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY provides helpful insights, such as Speaker B's tips for playing Resident Evil and Speaker A's preference for less scary games. It illustrates prior conversations where Speaker A and Speaker B discussed playing games together, which aligns with the current dialogue context where Speaker A asks for game suggestions. Each sentence in the MEMORY is well-structured and coherent, forming a clear narrative of the speakers' past interactions and interests. This allows a language model to effectively generate a contextually appropriate response."
