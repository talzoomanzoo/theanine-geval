Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A suggested the name Zhao for one of the kittens.\n2. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n3. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n4. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n5. Speaker B has an older mellow cat and is concerned about training the new energetic kittens.\n6. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating a response in the context of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes details about Speaker A's interest in adopting kittens and their existing pet, a parrot named Tasha, which directly relates to their interaction about adopting rescue kittens. The mention of Speaker B's older cat and concerns about training energetic kittens, along with Speaker A's interest in training tips, also lends relevant context, as it can influence the ongoing discussion about kittens. The potential for giving kittens Mandarin names introduces an additional layer of cultural relevance and personalization that could be further explored in the dialogue. However, the first memory about the name Zhao is less relevant since names are being currently discussed, and it was not mentioned in the immediate context. Overall, the structured connections and developed information from MEMORY sufficiently aid the progression of conversation in the CONTEXT."
