Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it? Speaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece.\n2. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian.\n3. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\n4. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five.\n5. Speaker B's favorite Greek god/goddess is Athena.\n6. Speaker A has kids and is familiar with Greek mythology.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds amazing! I can't wait to explore the Acropolis and learn more about the history and significance of the ancient ruins. Thank you for the tip about visiting the museum first - it will definitely enhance the experience.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information, but it is not fully optimized for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. Sentence 1 mentions Speaker B recommending the Acropolis, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A talks about booking an excursion there. However, the mention of the Parthenon and the beach on Corfu Island is not directly related to the current conversation about the Acropolis in Athens.\n\n2. Sentences 2 and 4 provide a background on Speaker B's excitement and plans regarding Greece, which may contribute to understanding the enthusiasm in Speaker B's response, although it doesn't directly relate to the Acropolis.\n\n3. Sentence 6, mentioning that Speaker A has kids and is familiar with Greek mythology, is tangentially relevant as it can inform Speaker B about Speaker A's possible interest in the historical aspects of the Acropolis visit.\n\nWhile there are some useful elements, overall, the development and connectivity of the memories related to the current context are not very strong, as most of the sentences do not directly provide helpful context for proceeding with the current dialogue about the Acropolis visit. The score of 3 reflects that the MEMORY has some sentences that are potentially beneficial but lacks clear and direct connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
