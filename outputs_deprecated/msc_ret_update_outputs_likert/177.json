Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know.  Speaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n2. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n4. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.\n5. Speaker A frequents live band venues and plays music at home.\n6. Speaker B's wife is pregnant and has three more months to go until the due date.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's incredibly kind of you and your friend! We'd definitely appreciate the offer to stay in the cabin. We'll make sure to discuss the details and let you know. It would be great for my wife to have some extra comfort during the festival.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides detailed and relevant information that can help generate a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Hereâ€™s why:\n\n1. The first memory sentence indicates a common interest in bluegrass music, which ties directly to the context of discussing a Bluegrass show.\n\n2. The second sentence about Speaker B's wife being pregnant and considering a local festival for just a day explains the hesitance that could be observed when discussing plans to attend the show. This background is necessary to understand why the offer of a cabin would be more appealing.\n\n3. Discussion of logistics when attending a festival with a small baby (third memory sentence) further illuminates potential complications Speaker B might be considering, making the offer of a more comfortable space at a cabin more pertinent.\n\n4. The aspect of Speaker B feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to attend music events adds emotional depth to Speaker B's response, which can subtly influence the conversation.\n\n5. The fifth memory sentence highlighting Speaker A's frequent attendance at music events reinforces the idea that they are likely knowledgeable about the logistics of such events, giving weight to any advice or discussion offered about attending festivals.\n\n6. Lastly, reiterating Speaker B's wife's pregnancy status and providing the timeline until her due date (the sixth memory sentence) further justifies the logistical considerations being made.\n\nThe MEMORY reflects a naturally structured development of past interactions and provides valuable context related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This can greatly aid in predicting a relevant and informed next response, demonstrating a clear connection and development of ideas."
