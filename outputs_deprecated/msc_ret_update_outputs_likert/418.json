Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin! Speaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name?  Speaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls!  Speaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well? Speaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens. Speaker B: hehe you're right. But i can't explain that why I am not a cat person to you sorry. How's the weather like today, still good weather to have iced tea out there? Speaker A: It's beautiful. I'm sitting outside while the Spice Girls are chasing bugs in the grass. What did your kids name your cats?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n2. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n3. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted and humorous conversation about their pets and travels.\n5. Speaker A usually leaves their cats with a friend while traveling.\n6. Speaker A is from a city known for great iced teas and prefers unsweetened iced tea.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Oh, that sounds like a lovely scene. My kids named the cats they brought home after different ice tea flavors - we have Chai, Earl Grey, and Oolong running around the house now. I must say, it's quite the eclectic mix!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 1 establishes the initial consideration of cat names (\"Marmalade\") and provides context for Speaker A's cat named Ginger, creating a connection to the dialogue where the name change to Pumpkin is discussed. Sentences 2 and 5 reinforce Speaker Aâ€™s circumstances regarding their cats, which ties into the ongoing cat-related conversation. Sentence 3 is directly relevant to the dialogue as it elaborates on Speaker B's relationship with cats, aligning with Speaker B's comments about not being a cat person. Sentence 6 helps contextualize Speaker A's interest in iced tea, which is directly referenced in the dialogue context. Overall, these points effectively support understanding and developing a response based on past interactions. However, the link to the discussion about iced tea is a bit indirect, preventing a perfect score."
