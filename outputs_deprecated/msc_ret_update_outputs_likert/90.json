Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing? Speaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from? Speaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets.\n2. Speaker B is a painter and is working on a portrait for Speaker A.\n3. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n4. Speaker A prefers adopting pets from shelters rather than from breeders.\n5. Speaker B has 5 dogs of different breeds and has rats as pets but didn't include them in the portrait.\n6. Speaker A has a brother and might commission a family portrait from Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's wonderful! Adopting from a shelter is such a kind choice. I can already imagine your new cat having some playful interactions with your dogs in the family portrait I'll paint for you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information that are helpful for generating an appropriate next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Notably, it mentions Speaker B's background as a painter and the fact that they are working on a portrait for Speaker A, which is directly relevant to the context where Speaker A acknowledges the progress of the portrait. Furthermore, Speaker B's interest in painting and including pets in portraits (points 1 and 2) aligns well with the conversation about pets and portrait painting. Additionally, the information about Speaker A's preference for shelter adoption (point 4) relates to their mention of getting a new cat from a shelter. Points 5 and 6, although not directly related to the given context, are naturally structured and don't distract from understanding their past interactions, which aids in generating contextually relevant responses. Overall, the MEMORY effectively captures past interactions and connections between the speakers that are useful for further dialogue development."
