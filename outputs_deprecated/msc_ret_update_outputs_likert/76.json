Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's interest in surfing (sentence 2) and their comparison of fishing and surfing (sentence 1). However, the connection between surfing and fishing, as mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, is not strongly established in the MEMORY. Moreover, details like Speaker A's nickname (sentence 3), Speaker B's music preferences (sentence 5), and Speaker A's focus on safety while surfing (sentence 6) are not directly relevant to the current conversation about learning music, fishing, and surfing. While some sentences are naturally structured, the overall MEMORY does not adequately represent the development of the speakers' past interactions nor does it provide clear contextual cues for generating a relevant next response."
