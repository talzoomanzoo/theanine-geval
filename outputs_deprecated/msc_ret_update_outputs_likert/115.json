Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok?  Speaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish? Speaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus! Speaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well? Speaker A: Yes, I am thinking about trying either the new eclairs, or their tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle! I have too many good options to pick from! What one would you pick? Speaker B: Hands down, I would pick the tres leches. Ever since I tried it a few years ago, it has always been my favorite dessert.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n2. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n3. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n4. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n5. Speaker A's restaurant plays a mix of songs, mainly easy listening, to create a relaxing environment for diners.\n6. Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information that can aid in generating a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, Memory 1 contains relevant information confirming that Speaker A works at a restaurant, which aligns with the context where Speaker A discusses exciting new menu items at work. Additionally, Memory 1 mentions Speaker A gets \"two free meals per week,\" which correlates with Speaker A's anticipation of trying the Chicken parmesan for free. Memory 6, which details Speaker A's work schedule, is not directly relevant to the specific context of the conversation but could be useful for understanding Speaker A's availability in general dialogues. Memories 2, 3, 5, and 4 contain information irrelevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT but are naturally phrased, ensuring the language model can distinguish them easily. Hence, while not all pieces of MEMORY are directly related to the dialogue, they are well-structured and connected, providing a solid context for dialogue generation."
