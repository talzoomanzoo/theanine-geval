Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n2. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n3. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue.\n4. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n5. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n6. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you so much! I'm really proud of this achievement, and it's great to have something tangible to show for my passion for origami.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY is quite helpful in offering contextual background about the speakers' shared interest in origami, which directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The past interactions show Speaker A's engagement with origami (\"enjoys origami,\" \"learned origami by themselves,\" \"volunteers at a hospital making origami crafts\") and provide relevant details about Speaker A's and Speaker B's conversations related to origami. The information that Speaker A has won a 3rd place prize fits well as it can be seen as a natural development of their interest and skills. Additionally, Speaker A's offer to teach Speaker B origami and Speaker B’s interest in making origami animals connects directly with their shared hobby, though the specific mention about making a lotus next (point 6) is slightly redundant given Speaker A’s mention of successfully making a Lotus flower (point 1) earlier. Overall, most of the MEMORY is naturally structured and relevant, capturing the context needed for a coherent dialogue, though with some redundancy."
