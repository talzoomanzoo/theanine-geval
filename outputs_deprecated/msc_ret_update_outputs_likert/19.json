Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim.  Speaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you  Speaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. Speaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you? Speaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it. Speaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car? Speaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming. Speaker A: That would be great too. I like to program in several different languages. Do you have a preference?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n2. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n4. Speaker B is interested in learning programming and is already practicing.\n5. Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and has signed up for several trips.\n6. Speaker A enjoys the food and the adventure of cruises.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains a mix of relevant and less relevant sentences regarding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. Sentence 1 in MEMORY is relevant as it highlights Speaker A's offer to teach Speaker B how to swim and program, which is aligned with the ongoing conversation about learning to swim and programming. \n2. Sentence 2 inaccurately attributes a specific music preference (punk music while swimming and learning programming) to Speaker B, which wasn't explicitly stated in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n3. Sentence 3 mentioning the cruise ship discussion ties in with Speaker A and Speaker B's conversation regarding traveling and Speaker B's interest in cruises, which is helpful. \n4. Sentence 4 indicating Speaker B's interest in programming was covered implicitly in the dialogue, adding moderate relevance.\n5. Sentence 5 about Speaker A's planning snorkeling trips and sentence 6 about enjoying cruises are less connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as the focus was on teaching and trips with Speaker B.\n\nOverall, while there is some useful context for generating responses, the MEMORY could be more precise and explicit in its connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
