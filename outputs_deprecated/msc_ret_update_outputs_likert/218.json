Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for music and plan to have a house concert with their pets.\n3. Speaker B is interested in taking a Disney cruise and has been watching videos on YouTube about them.\n4. Speaker A has a pet raccoon and has a friend who found baby raccoons.\n5. Speaker A's friend found two baby raccoons in her yard, one of which was given to Speaker A to keep as a pet.\n6. Speaker A is not interested in going on a cruise and would prefer camping as a vacation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Oh, Journey must really love pizza! Sid would probably try to steal a piece too if he could. Maybe we can have a mini house concert soon to distract them from the pizza temptation. What do you think?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant background information that could be helpful for understanding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, MEMORY point 1 notes that Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey, which is directly relevant to understanding the context of Journey eating a piece of pizza. MEMORY point 5 provides additional context on how Speaker A obtained Journey, which could be seen as supporting background. However, other points in the MEMORY, such as Speaker B's interest in a Disney cruise (point 3) or Speaker A's vacation preferences (point 6), are not directly relevant to the current conversation about Journey and the pizza. While some helpful context is provided, not all the memories are directly applicable or crucial for generating a next response in this particular dialogue context. The relevant sentences are phrased in a way that aids understanding, but there are other sentences that do not contribute significantly to the current dialogue, which affects the overall helpfulness score."
