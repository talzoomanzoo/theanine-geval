Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n2. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\n3. Speaker B plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge for college applications.\n4. Speaker B is a member of the boy scouts and works at a fast food place\n5. Speaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat.\n6. Speaker A is involved in church activities and mentioned a church retreat\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, definitely! Boy Scouts has taught me so much about survival skills and being resourceful in the outdoors. I've had the opportunity to practice setting up shelters, starting fires, and even cooking meals over a campfire. It's been such a rewarding experience.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that can contribute to Speaker B's response. Specifically, the details regarding Speaker B's lengthy involvement with the Boy Scouts and their intention to earn the Eagle Scout badge (MEMORY 1 and 3) highlight relevant experiences and aspirations. These elements connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A is asking about survival skills learned through the Boy Scouts. MEMORY 5 suggests Speaker B's interest in participating in a retreat, aligning with Speaker A's suggestion of roughing it. However, certain details, such as Speaker B's employment and church-related activities, are not directly connected to the context of discussing survival skills. Overall, while there is useful information, not all of it focuses on the immediate context, resulting in a moderate score."
