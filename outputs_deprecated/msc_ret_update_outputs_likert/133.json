Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n2. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n3. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n4. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n5. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n6. Speaker B lives with their mom and is currently in college.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's understandable, deciding on a career path can be overwhelming. Teaching could be a rewarding choice, especially in a field you're passionate about like linguistics. Have you considered looking into teaching opportunities at universities or colleges?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers helpful contextual information for generating a response relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The past interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B are clearly structured, allowing for a coherent understanding of their relationship and typical subjects of discussion. Here is an explanation of why the MEMORY was rated a 4:\n\n1. **Speaker B's Career Considerations**: Memory sentences 1 and 2 give insight into Speaker B's academic pursuits in linguistics and their career considerations, linking well with the current conversation about career options and teaching, making this MEMORY relevant.\n\n2. **Speaker B’s Involvement**: Sentence 5 adds depth by indicating that Speaker B is actively enhancing their experience and potential career through volunteer work. This information could guide Speaker A in offering support or advice, maintaining relevance.\n\n3. **Possession of Specific Interests**: Sentence 3 presents information about Speaker A's interest in teaching robotics, although not immediately related to the current context, it is phrased helpfully enough for understanding whether it could be relevant.\n\n4. **General Context**: Sentences 4 and 6 provide a general backdrop of Speaker A and B’s shared values and Speaker B’s living situation, which though more general, connect naturally to the context of career and life decisions.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is interconnected and well-structured enough to assist the generation of a relevant dialogue response while maintaining flow and connection between the past interactions and the immediate context."
