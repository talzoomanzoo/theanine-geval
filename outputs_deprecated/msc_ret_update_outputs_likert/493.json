    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work? Speaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol Speaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise?  Speaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows. Speaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity.  Speaker B: Yes, I agree. What kind of hours would this new job have?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n3. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n4. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking, mentioning setting up a hammock at their campsite.\n5. Speaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality.\n6. Speaker A plans to bring sandwiches and fruit for the hike, specifically asking about veggie sandwiches for Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm not entirely sure about the exact hours yet, but I think it will be a mix of mornings and evenings. I'll probably have to work some weekends too, but that's okay. It'll give me more time to explore the hiking trails in the area on weekdays when it's less crowded.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it lacks clear development and causality in most parts. Sentence 1 is directly relevant because it links Speaker A's job application to the grocery store and hiking, which connects to the conversation about Speaker A's new job and interest in solitary activities like hiking. Sentence 4 is also relevant as it aligns with Speaker A's interest in hiking mentioned in the dialogue. Sentence 5 adds some context to Speaker B's character that might be useful later, but it is not directly related to the current dialogue. However, sentences such as 2, 3, and 6 do not contribute significantly to generating the next response based on the current conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making the MEMORY less cohesive overall. While some relevant connections exist, the overall organization and development could be improved for better helpfulness."
