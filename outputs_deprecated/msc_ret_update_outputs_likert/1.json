Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n2. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n3. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n4. Speaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\n5. Speaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Costa Rica sounds amazing! I've never been there, but I've heard it's a beautiful place with so much to explore. Are you all set with your packing or still in the last-minute rush?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful context relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it includes information about Speaker B's upcoming trip and their excitement about the trip (points 1 and 3), which directly relates to the current conversation about purchasing plane tickets and traveling to Costa Rica. This helps in understanding Speaker B's enthusiasm and possibly the motivation for their trip. However, other details, such as Speaker A's concerns about gas mileage and specific details about Speaker B's car (points 4 and 5), lack direct relevance to the immediate dialogue about Costa Rica. Additional context about Speaker B receiving a new car and driving plans (point 4) doesn't directly connect to the plane ticket conversation and might not be as helpful for generating the next response. However, the MEMORY provides a broader context around travel and interactions between the speakers, which could aid in creating a more informed and contextually aware response. Overall, the MEMORY has relevance and helpfulness, but not all sentences are equally beneficial for the current dialogue direction."
