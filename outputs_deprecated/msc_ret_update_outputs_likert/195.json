Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make? Speaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it. Speaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too? Speaker B: Yeah definitely! I know you like hot foods, so if you learn and can make them fresh it will taste amazing. Have you tried any new foods lately? Speaker A: Not any new foods, but I did try a new food truck near me that was delicious! It was street tacos and you could pick from barbacoa, chicken, and steak for the protein. Do you like Mexican food?  Speaker B: Oh god I do love Mexican food. That was be so hard to pick because they're all so good! Did they have al pastor by any chance? I loved marinated pork tacos. Speaker A: unfortunately no, but I can ask them if they plan to get it in the future. I had one of each and they were all good in their own way. Have you ever had Birra tacos? I'd love to try those next. Speaker B: I've never had birra tacos, what are those? They sound intriguing. Speaker A: If I understand it correctly, the tortilla is dipped in the liquid from the braised meat, and then fried on a flat top. Then filled with the meat that was braised and other toppings that you like. I'll let you know if I find a place that serves these tacos in our area! Speaker B: Wow, my mouth is watering. I'll definitely have to try that. It sounds amazing and might be a new favorite. Is it spicy? Speaker A: I'm not sure, but if I had to guess I'd say a little at least. Do you enjoy spicy food?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally.\n2. Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\n3. Speaker A plays the drums and loves making food for others.\n4. Speaker A enjoys cooking and finds it helpful for stress relief.\n5. Speaker A cooked steak, fried potatoes, and shrimp for dinner with their father.\n6. Speaker B is interested in the weather in October at Speaker A's location.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I do enjoy spicy food, it adds such a nice flavor kick to dishes. If those Birra tacos have a bit of spice, I'll probably love them even more! Let me know when you find a place serving them, we can go together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that can be useful in generating a response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it doesn't consistently provide clear, natural connections between past interactions of the speakers. For instance, MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 4 indicate Speaker A's interest in cooking, which is relevant to the dialogue where Speaker A expresses a desire to learn how to make spicy foods. MEMORY 2 is also helpful as it highlights Speaker B's enjoyment in cooking and a specific dish that ties back to the garlic chicken mentioned in the dialogue. However, some other points in the MEMORY, such as Speaker A playing the drums and cooking for their father, are not directly relevant to the ongoing discussion about spicy food and Mexican cuisine. Additionally, MEMORY 6 about the weather does not relate to the current conversation in any meaningful way. While the information is somewhat useful, not all entries are clearly connected to the dialogue, which affects the overall cohesion and context. Thus, the MEMORY receives a score of 3, as it provides some relevant insights but does not fully align with the current context in a structured and naturally connected manner."
