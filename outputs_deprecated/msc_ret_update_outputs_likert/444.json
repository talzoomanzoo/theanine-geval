Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast. Speaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project. Speaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it.\n2. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\n3. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things.\n4. Speaker A is a martial arts teacher and student and is pursuing an athletic training degree in college.\n5. Speaker B is busy debugging software and is a runner.\n6. Speaker A is a college student who teaches jiu-jitsu and is lactose intolerant.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides several helpful pieces of information that could assist the language model, representing Speaker B, in generating a relevant and coherent response. The MEMORY reveals that Speaker A has a strong interest in martial arts, both as a teacher and a student, and is also pursuing a related college degree. This aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions attending a martial arts class. Additionally, MEMORY indicates that Speaker B has an interest in martial arts and has recently signed up for a class on its history, which could be leveraged in the conversation about projects and learning. Moreover, the mention of Speaker B being involved in software work links to Speaker B's comment about working on a project. \n\nThe MEMORY provides a naturally structured backdrop that highlights shared interests and possible areas for deeper discussion, making it quite relevant to the dialogue at hand. However, certain details, such as Speaker A being lactose intolerant and Speaker B being a runner, though naturally phrased, do not directly enhance the immediate dialogue context, slightly impacting the overall helpfulness. Nonetheless, it scores high as it sets a relevant and engaging context for the conversation."
