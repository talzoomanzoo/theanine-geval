Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin! Speaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name?  Speaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls!  Speaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well? Speaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens. Speaker B: hehe you're right. But i can't explain that why I am not a cat person to you sorry. How's the weather like today, still good weather to have iced tea out there? Speaker A: It's beautiful. I'm sitting outside while the Spice Girls are chasing bugs in the grass. What did your kids name your cats? Speaker B: ohh so nice sounds like you are enjoying the weather. Still we are discussing about that. Did not name them yet. Also I want to put them back since I am not a big fan of cat Speaker A: That would be cruel to do. You need to rehome them properly or otherwise someone may report you to the authorities for animal abuse. My heart is breaking for your poor cats. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n2. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n3. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n4. Speaker A usually leaves their cats with a friend while traveling.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted and humorous conversation about their pets and travels.\n6. Speaker A is from a city known for great iced teas and prefers unsweetened iced tea.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Oh no, don't worry! I was just kidding. I may not be a cat person, but I still take good care of them and make sure they find loving homes. Just like how you leave Ginger and Pumpkin with your friend, I'll make sure these little ones are well taken care of. I can't have them feeling left out with all the Spice Girls' adventures going on!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context, although it could be more directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. Speaker A has a cat named Ginger and considered naming a new kitten Marmalade. This ties into the conversation where Speaker A talks about changing the kitten's name to Pumpkin â€“ however, the MEMORY could be clearer about the current name being Pumpkin for completeness.\n2. Speaker B is noted as not being a cat person but having stray cats brought home by kids, which provides background for their ambivalence about naming the cats and considering rehoming them. This is significant to the current conversation but lacks detail on Speaker B's feelings.\n3. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten. While useful, it's not mentioned in the dialogue.\n4. Speaker A usually leaves their cats with a friend while traveling is not related to this dialogue context, which does not discuss travel.\n5. A light-hearted and humorous conversation presents a tone context, though it's somewhat missing in this dialogue as it turns more serious towards the end when discussing rehoming.\n6. Speaker A's preference for unsweetened iced tea from a city known for great iced teas doesn't directly connect but touches on the topic of iced tea during a weather and lifestyle segment.\n\nMEMORY could be more focused and directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, especially on the change to the name Pumpkin and the discussion on rehoming. More specific details about the existing context would increase its helpfulness score."
