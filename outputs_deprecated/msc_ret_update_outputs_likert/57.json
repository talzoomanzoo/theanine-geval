Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. Speaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk? Speaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n2. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n3. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks.\n4. Speaker A asks about Speaker B's new artwork and acknowledges their need for inspiration.\n5. Speaker A is a fan of the Game of Thrones series and enjoys audiobooks.\n6. Speaker A recommends the new album by Highly Suspect to Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds lovely! I always enjoy walks by rivers. Did you come across any interesting wildlife or plant life along the trail?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context that could be helpful for generating an appropriate next response. It establishes that Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and finds inspiration for artwork during nature walks, aligning with the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about nature walks. This information could be used to create a personalized and engaging response from Speaker B, such as inquiring further about the location or sharing their own experiences with trails and nature scenery. However, many of the other memory points, like Speaker A's interest in Game of Thrones or audiobooks, and the recommendation of an album, do not relate to the current dialogue context about nature walks. These points, while phrased naturally, do not aid in developing the immediate conversation, which is focused on nature walking. Therefore, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but not fully aligned with the current topic."
