Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming? Speaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both. Speaker A: That sounds interesting. That's great that you love your job, not many people do. Speaker B: Love is a strong word! I do like it though. There have been jobs I hated and I'm great full not be in that place. Hows you job going? Speaker A: Its going good. Its summer so we are really busy right now. I am just grateful to be back at work. How long have you worked for your company? Speaker B: For about four years. It's an industry in flux which is stressful. I need stability for my family at this point. It has changed my focus, which I'm not used to yet. Are you considering any other options for work?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates.\n2. Speaker A works for a small local business with a demanding schedule.\n3. Speaker A is 27 years old and hopes to change careers soon.\n4. Speaker A is torn between choosing a career in dentistry for the money or working at Disney for happiness.\n5. Speaker A is considering a career in dentistry but is also interested in working at Disney for happiness.\n6. Speaker A does not have children and spends time working and reading.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I can imagine how stressful that must be with the industry constantly changing. As for me, I've been thinking about changing careers lately. I'm torn between pursuing dentistry for financial stability or working at Disney for personal happiness. It's a tough decision to make.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some potentially relevant information, such as Speaker A's career considerations (points 4 and 5) and their employment at a small local business (point 2). However, much of the MEMORY is structured in a somewhat disjointed manner and does not strongly correlate with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on current job satisfaction and stability. The MEMORY lacks a clear connection and development with the ongoing conversation about job satisfaction, stability, and future career considerations. Also, Speaker B's memory item (point 1) about being unable to change careers due to their child is not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and is not helpful for generating a response that would continue the present conversation flow naturally. The MEMORY provides context but only minimally aids in generating a well-informed, contextually relevant response."
