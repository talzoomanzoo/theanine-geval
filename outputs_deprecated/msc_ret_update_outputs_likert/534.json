Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?   Speaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere! Speaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it. Speaker A: I don't have recipes but I know how to make a good grilled asparagus. Are you looking to bolster your chef book?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys grilling indoors and suggests grilled asparagus with lemon on it.\n2. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n3. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters.\n4. Speaker B is interested in volunteering and prefers cats over dogs, especially kittens.\n5. Speaker B is interested in becoming a chef but hasn't had the time to apply for jobs.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B are excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I would love to add a grilled asparagus recipe to my chef book! It sounds like a delicious and healthy option. Maybe we can try it out together sometime.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding both speakers' preferences and interests. For example, MEMORY sentence 1 reinforces Speaker A's expertise and preference for grilling, which is in line with the conversation about asparagus. MEMORY sentence 2 aligns well with the conversation topic about animals, showing it reflects Speaker A’s enthusiasm for puppies and their presence at the shelter well. MEMORY sentences 3 and 4 inform us of Speaker A and Speaker B's shared and differing interests in volunteering at animal shelters and their preferences for cats over dogs. This complements the discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding puppies and kittens. MEMORY sentence 5 gives some insight into Speaker B’s professional aspirations, relevant to being interested in recipes, as discussed in the context. Although MEMORY sentence 6 about traveling feels slightly less related, it is still naturally phrased to ensure minimal confusion in identifying relevance. Overall, MEMORY organizes helpful information regarding the speakers' interactions and connections in the context, making it easy for the language model to generate coherent responses."
