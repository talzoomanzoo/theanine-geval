Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position.  Speaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it? Speaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n3. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n4. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n5. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n6. Speaker B started looking for jobs towards the end of college to secure a job for after graduation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "That's a great way to stay connected to the game! Do you have a favorite team you enjoy watching the most?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides several helpful details relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reveals Speaker B's background in intramural soccer, which aligns with the context of discussing Speaker B's experience as a goalkeeper in college. The MEMORY also mentions Speaker B's interest in Manchester United, potentially explaining his continued interest in watching soccer games on TV. Details about Speaker A's involvement in soccer, such as playing as a striker and being a fan of Arsenal, add some context to their mutual interest in soccer. These elements provide a solid foundation for generating relevant and contextually appropriate responses. The mention of Speaker B looking for jobs is less relevant to the current conversation, but it is naturally phrased and can be easily identified as peripheral information. Overall, the MEMORY is structured well to support an understanding of the dialogue context, though it could be more directly connected to the current exchange of missing playing soccer and watching games."
