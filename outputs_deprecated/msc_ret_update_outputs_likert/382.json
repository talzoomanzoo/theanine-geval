Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think? Speaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons Speaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use. Speaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n2. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n3. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n4. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n5. Speaker B enjoys fishing and wishes their wife and sons could have joined them on the trip.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B have a conversation about their personal interests and trips they have taken for work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "They can be painful, especially in certain areas, but the end result is always worth it for me. It's like a reminder of something important in my life every time I look at them. Maybe you could start with a small design in a less sensitive area to see how it feels for you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several relevant details that could be helpful for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. Items 1 and 2 in the MEMORY describe Speaker A's interest and experience with tattoos, including having tattoos dedicated to their late father. This is directly relevant to the current dialogue about getting a tattoo for their mother to match the one for their father, and helps in crafting a response that acknowledges Speaker A's existing tattoos and their significance.\n\n2. Item 3 and 4 mention Speaker A's workplace at a coffee shop owned by their mom, which could potentially tie into the conversation about honoring parents, although this connection is not explicitly drawn in the dialogue so far. \n\n3. Items about Speaker B's interests, like fishing, are less relevant to the current conversation but provide context in case the dialogue shifts to personal interests.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides helpful context and background on Speaker A's tattoo experiences and motivations, while also offering a glimpse into other interests that could be relevant if the conversation takes a different direction. The information is structured in a way that demonstrates the speakers' past interactions and provides context for their personal lives. However, not all entries are equally connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is why this MEMORY doesn't score perfectly."
