    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment.  Speaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon? Speaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think? Speaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus! Speaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing? Speaker A: Yea, I think for the more complicated origami it's kind of a use it or lose it but for the simple stuff you can usually take a couple months of and still remember to do it! Did you see origami in Japan? Speaker B: Not up close, but I noticed a lot in shop windows in certain areas. I love Japan -- they're so welcoming. One of our acquaintances GAVE me a kimono. She said it's customary to try to share their culture. Kind of different from America in my opinion.   Speaker A: Oh, that sounds wonderful. It's impressive how much things that came from there and how giving a culture they are. America is definetly a lot different from them, have you visted different states in America? Speaker B: Oh yes. I live in North Carolina, but I've been to almost every state. Alaska was by far my favorite, but I'm kind of a loner and it feels like a lot of people there are, so maybe I just relate. But the scenery and landscapes are unbelievably beautiful. What's your favorite place you've been to? Speaker A: I just visited Italy recently, it was much better than I had first anticipated, similar to Alaska with all the landscapes and scenery! Now I'm planning to go to Japan, do you have any recommendations on what to do there?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A wishes to visit the country where origami was originally created, possibly Japan.\n2. Speaker B was recommended volunteering by Speaker A and has traveled to Japan and Italy, enjoying the art and food.\n3. Speaker B has visited Japan and found it to be an amazing country.\n4. Speaker A met someone at the hospital who visited Italy and enjoyed the art museums and restaurants there.\n5. Speaker A plans to visit Italy first before going to Japan.\n6. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Oh, Italy must have been an incredible experience! In Japan, you should definitely visit the historic temples in Kyoto, explore the bustling streets of Tokyo, and immerse yourself in the rich culture by trying traditional tea ceremonies and enjoying the delicious local cuisine. Don't forget to visit some of the beautiful gardens and maybe even attend a traditional Japanese performance. You're going to have an amazing time there!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided has some helpful information, but it is not optimally aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. There are relevant snippets such as Speaker A offering to teach Speaker B origami (#6), which directly connects to Speaker B's interest in learning (#3 and last sentence of #4 in the dialogue context). However, some parts of MEMORY are structured in a way that does not clearly represent past interactions or are slightly inaccurate, such as confusing recommendations or visitation order (#2, #5). Also, MEMORY includes details not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT (e.g., Speaker A meeting someone at the hospital who visited Italy, #4). Better structuring and pruning of these elements to focus more on the detailed interaction pertaining to origami, travel experiences, and upcoming plans for visiting Japan could improve the MEMORY's helpfulness score. The development of information could also be better, as it does not entirely capture the progression or specific conversational cues from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
