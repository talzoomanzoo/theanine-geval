Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me. Speaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway? Speaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible. Speaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most? Speaker A: I like to go hiking in the local trails here. I am familiar with them and there's so many routes that I can take. Sadly, the bugs are as bad here as they are anywhere else..... Speaker B: They can't be that bad in the fall right? I hope? Do you camp most every weekend? Speaker A: A least a couple of times a month. Sometimes, yeah, I go every weekend to relax. Being in nature is so relaxing to me. And nah the bugs aren't too bad in the fall and winter. There's a beautiful river along one trail that I bet you'd love to see. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n2. Speaker A enjoys camping trips and looking for wild animals in the woods.\n3. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n4. Speaker B dislikes bugs and is not a fan of camping, hiking, or the outdoors.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy being outdoors, but Speaker B prefers the fresh air over being in the mud and rain.\n6. Speaker A enjoys hiking, birdwatching, and spotting rare animals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds lovely, a beautiful river view would be nice to see. Maybe I'll give it a try in the fall when the bugs aren't as bothersome. I might even join you on one of your hiking trips if the weather is just right.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, Memory item 4 is directly relevant as it confirms Speaker B's dislike of bugs and the outdoors, which aligns well with the ongoing conversation about hiking and bugs. This helps to maintain the context and continuity between their past interactions and the current dialogue. Additionally, Memory items 2 and 6 reflect Speaker A's interest in outdoor activities, which corresponds to their expressed enjoyment of hiking and being in nature within the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\nHowever, some items like Memory item 1 and 5 contain slightly conflicting or less relevant information. Memory item 1 states that Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it, which contradicts Speaker B's expressed reluctance towards outdoor activities in the dialogue. Memory item 5 implies that both speakers enjoy being outdoors although it is acknowledged that Speaker B prefers fresh air but not necessarily hiking or camping, which partially aligns with the context but requires consideration in phrasing. Despite some less helpful details or slight contradictions, the MEMORY still provides a structured context that reflects the general sentiment and preferences of both speakers, aiding in generating an appropriate next response."
