Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n2. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n3. Speaker B has a young daughter who is 8 years old and is becoming independent.\n4. Speaker B's daughter likes monkeys and is starting to assert her independence.\n5. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n6. Speaker B is away from their child and glad that the pets are with them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, she had a great time! She especially loved seeing the monkeys at the zoo.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant context for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks a strong, coherent connection to the specific questions Speaker A asks. Sentences 1, 2, 3, and 4 provide some level of context as they mention Speaker B's daughter, her interest in the zoo, and her growing independence, which might be pertinent to Speaker A's inquiry about the trip and her enjoyment. However, sentences 5 and 6 introduce unrelated information about Speaker A and pets, respectively, which could distract the language model. The information is structured with some coherence, but not all of it directly supports understanding the current dialogue's context or provides clear cues for a model to follow."
