    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet.\n2. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n4. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n5. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking.\n6. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been looking into some wildlife tours to see bears and whales in their natural habitats. I think that would be a unique experience in Alaska.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides comprehensive background information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It indicates that Speaker B has started planning a trip to Alaska but isn't quite sure about options beyond hiking (#1 and #2), which aligns with Speaker A's inquiry about ideas for the trip. The MEMORY also states that both Speaker A and Speaker B are planning the trip together (#3), highlighting the collaborative nature of their conversation. Additionally, it notes Speaker A's familiarity with outdoor activities in Alaska (#4 and #5), which can guide Speaker B. Lastly, the mention of potential skiing opportunities (#6) can be useful for generating further discussion about the trip activities. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured and maintains clear causality and relevance to the context, aiding in generating a coherent and informed response."
