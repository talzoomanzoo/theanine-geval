Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand. Speaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  Speaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery Speaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library?  Speaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done Speaker B: Well if you ever need someone to come and help for a couple of hours here and there, give me a call, you know how much I love to be in the library anyway\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a retired librarian who enjoys implementing creative activities in their library.\n2. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n3. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n4. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B agree on the importance of reading and the value of libraries, despite the rise of the internet.\n6. Speaker A sees parents bringing in their little kids to the library as encouraging.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you so much for the offer, that means a lot. Having your help at the library would truly make a difference, especially during these busy times. I will definitely keep that in mind and reach out when needed.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful information for Speaker A, the language model, to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. There are sentences in the MEMORY that align with the context, such as information about Speaker A's work at the library (related to being busy and short-staffed) and Speaker B's interest in spending time with grandkids, as well as making the fishing trip an annual tradition. These aspects are directly relevant to the ongoing conversation. However, not all sentences are directly relevant or add value to the specific dialogue provided, such as the general agreement on the importance of reading and libraries (sentence 5) or seeing parents bringing kids to the library (sentence 6). These might be more general past interactions rather than specifically needed for the present context. Despite this, the information provided is naturally connected and structured in a way that provides a beneficial and coherent background, supporting the conversational continuity and context understanding, thus deserving a high score."
