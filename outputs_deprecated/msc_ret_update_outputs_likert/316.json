Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you. Speaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them Speaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued.  Speaker B: Well if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get  Speaker A: Wow! Ok! This is sounding like a bigger undertaking! Should I embrace bugs in the home if they help the plants or am I getting wild? Speaker B: Well from my experince bugs do the complete opposite and don't help at all, so avoid that at all costs! Fertilizers are the way to go to help with growth. Speaker A: Oh man. I have lots to learn. What is the lifespan of a plum tree? Speaker B: around 10 to 15 years but if you take care of them I'm sure you could get 20 out of it. Speaker A: Now we are also talking commitment! This is not how I expected my day to go! I am excited, yet so nervous!  Speaker B: It doesn't take too much time to do per day so after school give it a little water and that should keep them in great way. Speaking off school how are you getting on? Speaker A: Ok! I am putting my fate in your hands on this one. School is fine. I don't really pay attention to anything except band class.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n4. Speaker A is a student who likes English in school and plays in the marching band.\n5. Speaker A's parents are teachers.\n6. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Band class can be a great escape from the academic side of things. It's nice to have something you enjoy so much. And remember, with your commitment to the garden, you'll soon find yourself enjoying the rewards of your hard work.",
    "prediction": "Based on the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY, let's evaluate the helpfulness of the MEMORY.\n\nThe dialogue context revolves around Speaker A expressing interest in starting a garden indoors and seeking advice from Speaker B, who provides suggestions and shares their gardening knowledge. The conversation also touches upon school and Speaker A's involvement in band class.\n\nNow, let's consider the MEMORY:\n\n1. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n   - Only partially relevant. It indicates Speaker A's lack of gardening experience and interest, which aligns with their need for advice in the dialogue.\n\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n   - Relevant, as it establishes Speaker B's credibility and knowledge in gardening, which justifies their role in advising Speaker A in the dialogue context.\n\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n   - Irrelevant to the current dialogue context, which is focused on gardening advice for indoors.\n\n4. Speaker A is a student who likes English in school and plays in the marching band.\n   - Partially relevant. Speaker B mentions school in the dialogue and Speaker A talks about band class, so this memory aligns with their school activities.\n\n5. Speaker A's parents are teachers.\n   - Irrelevant to the dialogue context, as it does not inform the gardening discussion or school-related conversation.\n\n6. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n   - Irrelevant to the current dialogue, though it hints at Speaker A's personality.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides some helpful information, predominantly about each speaker's gardening experience and a bit about Speaker A's involvement in school activities. However, it also contains several pieces of information that do not enhance the dialogue context or are unrelated to the gardening focus of the conversation.\n\nHelpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY received a score of 3 because it offers some relevant contextual cues related to gardening advice and mentions Speaker A's interest in band class, aligning with part of the discussion. However, it also includes several aspects that are irrelevant to the current dialogue context, which partially decreases its usefulness."
