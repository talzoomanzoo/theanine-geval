Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n2. Speaker A used to live in a suburb of DC and misses the convenience of city life.\n3. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n4. Speaker A works on a family farm and will be using the new truck for farm work.\n5. Speaker B is open to moving to the country to be further away from neighbors.\n6. Speaker B's children have been sick, and Speaker B also had a fever, possibly influencing their decision to buy 20 lotto tickets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not offer helpful information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context involves Speaker A mentioning a new and expensive iPhone purchase, but the MEMORY focuses on unrelated topics such as lotto tickets, living locations, and farm work. There is no information about Speaker A's phone purchase or any relevant context that could inform a proper response based on the iPhone discussion. The sentences in the MEMORY do not demonstrate a clear connection or development related to the dialogue context. Thus, it lacks relevance and usefulness for generating a coherent or informed response in this situation."
