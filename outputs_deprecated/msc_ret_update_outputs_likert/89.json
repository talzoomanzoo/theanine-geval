Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing? Speaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n2. Speaker B is a painter and is working on a portrait for Speaker A.\n3. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets.\n4. Speaker B has 5 dogs of different breeds and has rats as pets but didn't include them in the portrait.\n5. Speaker A has a brother and might commission a family portrait from Speaker B.\n6. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy the company of their pets and think they are smart and playful.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a fun and unexpected pairing for a portrait! As for the new cat, I'm thinking of adopting from a local shelter. I want to give a loving home to a cat in need.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided offers helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains several relevant details, such as Speaker B being a painter, specifically working on a portrait for Speaker A, which connects directly to the topic of conversation (the portrait mentioned in the dialogue). Additionally, the mention of pets, particularly the variety and interesting interactions imagined by Speaker B (point 1), aligns well with the ongoing discussion about Speaker B's pets (great dane and pet rat) and Speaker A's inquiry about getting a new cat. This establishes a clear relationship and development between past interactions and the current dialogue. However, a few sentences, like mentions about Speaker A's brother and the preference for painting regular people, are not directly connected to the current conversation, which holds back the score from a perfect 5. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured and offers significant helpfulness for understanding and generating contextually relevant responses."
