Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you. Speaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them Speaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued.  Speaker B: Well if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n4. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n5. Speaker A plays the clarinet in a band concert and has a solar investment for their office building.\n6. Speaker A's parents are teachers.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I see what you mean. Maybe I can start with some smaller plants and work my way up to trees. I definitely want that authentic garden experience, just on a slightly smaller scale!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that can assist Speaker A in generating a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, the fact that Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening (Memory point 2) is helpful, as this supports their suggestions in the context of creating a garden in the home. Additionally, Speaker A's struggle with gardening (Memory point 1) further contextualizes their need for advice. However, the memory also includes unrelated information, such as Speaker A playing the clarinet and their parents' occupation, which do not contribute to the dialogue's progression. The intrinsic connection between helpful information and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is somewhat unclear, leaving room for improvement but overall, it provides a sufficient amount of relevant context."
