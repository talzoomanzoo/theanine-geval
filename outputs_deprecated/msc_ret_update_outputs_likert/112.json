Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok?  Speaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish? Speaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n2. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n3. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n4. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n5. Speaker A is an omnivore.\n6. Speaker A's restaurant plays a mix of songs, mainly easy listening, to create a relaxing environment for diners.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds delicious! I can't wait to see the picture and hear how it tastes. Your workplace seems to have some amazing dishes on the menu.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information for Speaker B to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, the information that Speaker A works at a restaurant (MEMORY 1 and 2) is relevant, as it aligns with the context where Speaker A mentions a new dish at their workplace. Additionally, MEMORY 2 implies that Speaker A can try new dishes for free, which is consistent with the conversation about trying the chicken parmesan. However, other details, such as Speaker B's love for the beach and Mediterranean food (MEMORY 4), do not directly connect to the current context. Although other points like the restaurant's atmosphere and Speaker A's diet preference provide some background, they are not directly relevant to the specific dialogue context. Despite some sentences not being directly connected, they are naturally phrased and structured to represent past interactions, making it easier to identify key pieces of information. Overall, MEMORY provides a moderate level of helpfulness with some relevant contextual cues."
