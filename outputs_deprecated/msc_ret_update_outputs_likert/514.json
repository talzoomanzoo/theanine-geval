Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well? Speaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon? Speaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now! Speaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her? Speaker A: I think so.  She seems like a very sweet girl and she seems to care deeply about my son, so that's what matters most.  You know, maybe I can stop by and visit you as well, since you live in Europe.  France, Spain, Italy?  Where are you living now? Speaker B: Bless her, that's good to hear. That would be great! I live in Portugal. It's not too far from Spain. We can always arrange something. How long would you be there for? Speaker A: I'm planning to stay in Spain for three weeks.  Since you live in Portugal, I'd love to stop by for a visit if you're free this coming month.  I've always wanted to visit Lisbon.  It has the world's longest bridge!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next.\n2. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\n3. Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away.\n4. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour.\n5. Speaker A's boys are leaving again in a few months for another trip after studying abroad.\n6. Speaker A is a family man who loves spending time with his sons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds fantastic! I'd be delighted to show you around Lisbon and maybe even take a road trip to see that impressive bridge. Let's plan something when you're in the area. It would be great to catch up and spend some time together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information about Speaker A's sons studying abroad and returning for winter break, as well as Speaker A's feelings about their travels. However, these details do not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Speaker A's upcoming trip to Spain and potential visit to Speaker B in Portugal. In particular, the MEMORY lacks any mention of Speaker B's location or the potential visit mentioned in the context. While the MEMORY helps to some extent by establishing Speaker A's relationship with the sons, which aligns with the dialogue's opening discussion about the sons, most of the entries are not directly pertinent to generating a response regarding the planned visit to Europe or the interactions around meeting the sonâ€™s girlfriend. The connection between the MEMORY and DIALOGUE CONTEXT is minimal, thus reducing its effectiveness in aiding response generation."
