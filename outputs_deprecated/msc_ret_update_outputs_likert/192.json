Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make? Speaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it. Speaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too? Speaker B: Yeah definitely! I know you like hot foods, so if you learn and can make them fresh it will taste amazing. Have you tried any new foods lately? Speaker A: Not any new foods, but I did try a new food truck near me that was delicious! It was street tacos and you could pick from barbacoa, chicken, and steak for the protein. Do you like Mexican food?  Speaker B: Oh god I do love Mexican food. That was be so hard to pick because they're all so good! Did they have al pastor by any chance? I loved marinated pork tacos. Speaker A: unfortunately no, but I can ask them if they plan to get it in the future. I had one of each and they were all good in their own way. Have you ever had Birra tacos? I'd love to try those next. Speaker B: I've never had birra tacos, what are those? They sound intriguing.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally.\n2. Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\n3. Speaker A plays the drums and loves making food for others.\n4. Speaker A enjoys cooking and finds it helpful for stress relief.\n5. Speaker A cooked steak, fried potatoes, and shrimp for dinner with their father.\n6. Speaker A enjoys surfing and offers to give Speaker B lessons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Birria tacos are delicious! They're a traditional Mexican dish made with tender, flavorful stewed meat typically served in a crispy taco shell with melted cheese. It's definitely worth trying if you enjoy Mexican cuisine. I can show you how to make them sometime if you'd like!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY consists of several sentences related to the interests and activities of Speaker A and Speaker B, which could be helpful to some extent for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, not all the sentences are directly applicable or highly connected to the specific dialogue. For instance:\n\n1. Sentence 1 highlights Speaker A's interest in cooking, which is relevant as they discuss trying spicy foods and learning to cook together.\n2. Sentence 2 mentions Speaker B's enjoyment of cooking and a garlic chicken recipe, tying into the opening request about garlic chicken.\n3. Sentence 4, about Speaker A finding cooking as stress relief, can subtly inform the dialogue about Speaker A’s motivation for cooking.\n\nHowever, sentences like 3, 5, and 6 — regarding playing drums, previously cooked meals, and surfing — do not provide immediate context or relevance to the current conversation about trying new foods, Mexican cuisine, or cooking spicy dishes, thus reducing the overall help the MEMORY provides. The sentence structure is appropriate, but the connection and relevance to the current conversation vary."
