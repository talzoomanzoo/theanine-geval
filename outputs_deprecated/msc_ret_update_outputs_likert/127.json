Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't! Just karate!

I will meet you at the Dojo at 3pm. I really appriciate it, and I will buy you lunch after too. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate.\n2. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.\n3.

    "raw_prediction": "Sounds like a plan! I'm looking forward to showing you around. Lunch after training sounds great, thank you for the offer!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some helpful background information about Speaker B, such as their involvement in karate and their green belt status. This is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Speaker A expresses interest in learning martial arts and Speaker B offers to bring them to the dojo. These details can help a language model generate responses that highlight Speaker B's experience and knowledge in karate, thus enhancing their credibility when recommending the martial art to Speaker A. \n\nHowever, many details in MEMORY are unrelated to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's background in football, their interest in IT certificates, and their enjoyment of water-related activities and movies like \"Jaws.\" These aspects do not directly contribute to developing the conversation's flow or context regarding martial arts discussions.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY offers some useful details for facilitating a language model response while also including several unrelated sentences. This results in a mixed level of helpfulness, earning a score of 3."
