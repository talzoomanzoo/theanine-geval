Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended.  Speaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n2. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n3. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot.\n4. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n5. Speaker A suggested the name Zhao for one of the kittens.\n6. Speaker B has an older mellow cat and is concerned about training the new energetic kittens.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been researching how to introduce them properly. I think with the right training and supervision, they can coexist peacefully. It'll just take some time and patience to make sure everyone is comfortable around each other.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that can aid in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it mentions that Speaker A has a parrot and is considering adopting a rescue kitten, which aligns with the current conversation about adopting kittens and how they might interact with the parrot. Additionally, it provides context that Speaker B has also considered adopting kittens and has been thinking about names for them, which correlates to their current discussion about naming one of the kittens. The MEMORY effectively captures the development and past interactions of both speakers regarding their interest in adopting kittens, naming them, and considering their interactions with existing pets. However, some sentences, such as those about Mandarin names and training tips, are less directly connected to the current context but still naturally fit within the broader conversation of adopting and naming kittens. Thus, the MEMORY is mostly helpful, but not perfectly aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, warranting a score of 4."
