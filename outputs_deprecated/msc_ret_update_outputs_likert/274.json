    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her? Speaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology.\n2. Speaker B enjoys Greek mythology and did a case study on Poseidon, the God of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses.\n3. Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries.\n4. Speaker A is planning to travel to Italy alone for Spring Break and has friends from Europe meeting up with them.\n5. Speaker B has been to Italy in the past and enjoyed the food there.\n6.

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear that you're doing well! It's wonderful that you're so passionate about Greek mythology. I'm sure your daughter will love hearing all about it too. And thank you, I'm trying my best to save up for the Italy trip. It's exciting to have something to look forward to!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that enriches the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 1 succinctly notes Speaker B's interest in visiting Greece, which aligns with the discussion about Greek mythology and helps to understand Speaker B's enthusiasm for visiting the Greek islands. Sentence 2 reinforces Speaker B's passion for Greek mythology, which is directly relevant to the conversation. Sentence 3, while not directly about Greek mythology, provides background on Speaker A's interests, which can be useful for maintaining a coherent exchange. Sentence 4, about Speaker A's travel plans, connects back to Speaker B's expressed interest in trips in Sentence 1. Sentence 5 adds a personal touch to the conversation about travel which Speaker A might find relatable given their shared interest in travel destinations like Italy. Sentence 6 offers personal details about Speaker B's daughter, potentially useful for understanding their environment, though it's less directly connected to Greek mythology or the travel theme. Overall, the memory is structured well and mostly relevant, providing a clear context for the conversation."
