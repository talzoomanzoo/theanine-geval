Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n3. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n4. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n5. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n6. Speaker A is a college student studying Humanities and wants to finish college before looking for a job.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Goalkeeper is a crucial position, even if it's not the most exciting. It requires a lot of skill and focus. Do you still play soccer occasionally?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided includes useful information to facilitate a better understanding of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes relevant details about both speakers' soccer experiences and interests. For instance, it mentions Speaker B's connection to soccer through playing intramural games in college and their interest in Manchester United, which aligns with Speaker B's statement about being a goalkeeper. Meanwhile, information about Speaker A's soccer activities (e.g., being a striker, enjoying playing in tournaments, and scoring well) could have been pertinent if the dialogue context were to involve Speaker A's gameplay or positions. \n\nAdditionally, shared interests and personal details, such as Speaker A being a fan of Arsenal, are presented naturally and could help the language model generate responses related to soccer discussions between the speakers. However, some information, like Speaker A studying Humanities, seems less related to the specific dialogue context, slightly limiting the memory's helpfulness. Overall, the information is well-structured and connected, supporting a score of 4."
