Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. Speaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price? Speaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music Speaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it. Speaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately? Speaker B: No I haven't! I keep hoping that I will so I can buy my dreamhouse but I know the chances are low.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n3. Speaker B bought 20 lotto tickets with the same numbers, aiming to get a bigger share of the jackpot if they win.\n4. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n5. Speaker B's children have been sick, and Speaker B also had a fever, possibly influencing their decision to buy 20 lotto tickets.\n6. Both speakers dream of having a city and country house or a summer and winter home.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provided mostly aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context involves Speaker A discussing their recent purchase of an iPhone and both speakers mentioning the hope of winning the lottery to alleviate financial concerns. The MEMORY details a past interaction between Speakers A and B about buying lottery tickets, their strategies, and their dreams if they were to win. This information is relevant to the dialogue context, as the conversation touches upon their hopes of winning the lottery. The MEMORY sentences are well structured and provide context on both speakers' shared interest in the lottery, effectively connecting to the dialogue context.\n\nHowever, points like Speaker B's children being sick and the mention of a fever (sentence 5) do not directly influence the current dialogue context about the iPhone or lottery. While this sentence offers insight into Speaker B's situation, its relevance to generating a response in the given dialogue context is limited compared to the rest. Despite this, overall, the MEMORY is quite helpful, but not perfectly so, resulting in a score of 4 instead of 5."
