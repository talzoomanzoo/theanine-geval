Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. Speaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price? Speaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music Speaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it. Speaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n3. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n4. Speaker B bought 20 lotto tickets with the same numbers, aiming to get a bigger share of the jackpot if they win.\n5. Speaker B's children have been sick, and Speaker B also had a fever, possibly influencing their decision to buy 20 lotto tickets.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Not yet, but I'm hopeful. With the way things have been going, a little luck wouldn't hurt. Plus, with my 20 tickets, who knows, maybe one of them will be the lucky one!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides moderate helpfulness for generating a proper next response in the context of the dialogue. \n- The MEMORY contains relevant information, such as both speakers having an interest in buying lotto tickets and discussing strategies, which connects to the ongoing talk about winning the lottery to help with the iPhone expenses.\n- Details about the number of tickets bought by Speaker A and Speaker B could add depth to their conversation in response to the question about \"luck lately.\"\n- However, some sentences in MEMORY, like Speaker B's children being sick and Speaker B's fever, might not directly contribute to the conversation about winning the lottery or its potential benefits, making them less relevant in the current dialogue context.\n\nNevertheless, the memory is mostly naturally structured, representing past interactions and setting a foundation for Speaker B's response."
