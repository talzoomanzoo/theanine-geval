    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer? Speaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to? Speaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors? Speaker B: Yes. That way they could have a fireworks show too. I love fireworks. Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle? Speaker A: No, but I have been to Disney World in Florida.  I love fireworks too.  I want to get married on the 4th of July.  That was we will have a national holiday and fireworks for us every year!  It sounds like you've been to Disneyland?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A loves Disney music.\n2. Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods.\n3. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo.\n4. Speaker A is planning to visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend.\n5. Speaker B enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food and live music.\n6. Speaker B has seen Three Dog Night in concert and enjoys their live shows.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I've been to Disneyland in California a few times. The fireworks show there is truly magical, especially with the castle as the backdrop. Getting married on the 4th of July sounds incredible! It's like having your own annual celebration with fireworks to mark the occasion.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant context related to Speaker A's interest in museums and concerts, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, Memory 2 mentions Speaker A's enjoyment of museums, which corresponds with Speaker A's discussion about visiting an art museum. Memory 3 relates to Speaker A's interest in music concerts, connected to Speaker A's inquiry about Speaker B's concert experience. However, some memories, such as Speaker A planning a trip to Sao Paulo (3, 4) and Speaker B's concert experience with Three Dog Night (6), are not directly relevant to the immediate context of their conversation about Disney and fireworks. The sentence about Disney music (1) would add more value if Speaker A's visit to Disney World had more emphasis on Disney-related content rather than fireworks. The memories are naturally phrased, and there is some relevant information, so the score reflects moderately helpful content."
