Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there? Speaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay? Speaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately? Speaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"' Speaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history. Speaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing?  Speaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha. Speaker A: Young people today really have different values than our generation had. Acting sounds like it would be personally rewarding. I also like the arts. I play guitar and piano. You mentioned that you have a poll. That sounds refreshing in the hot weather. Speaker B: Yes it's great, but it hasn't stopped raining here! How's the weather where you are?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n2. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\n4. Both Speaker A's mother and Speaker A were librarians, but Speaker A is retired.\n5. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n6. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's been sunny here, but we could use some rain to water the garden. Maybe you can bring some of that rain back with you from Costa Rica! Make sure to pack an umbrella just in case.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information that could aid Speaker A in generating a relevant response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, the fact that Speaker B is going on a trip is relevant to the current conversation about travel plans to Costa Rica (though it appears that this specific memory fact is outdated, as Speaker B mentions already having purchased plane tickets and being prepared for the trip in the dialogue context). Speaker A's background as a retired librarian could also be beneficial in shaping responses related to books and reading, and to connect with Speaker B's interest or queries on those topics.\n\nHowever, several sentences in the MEMORY don't directly contribute to understanding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT or supporting the development of the conversation. For example, the mention of Easter weekend and spring break may not be immediately useful in this specific context. Additionally, the indication of both speakers having a sense of humor, as evidenced by their use of \"lol,\" doesn't add specific value to this exchange.\n\nOverall, while there are useful bits of information, the MEMORY could be structured more effectively to support the dialogue specifically about travel and interests in mutual activities. The sentences are mostly disconnected from each other and from the dialogue, which limits their helpfulness in prompting relevant language generation."
