Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me. Speaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway? Speaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible. Speaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most? Speaker A: I like to go hiking in the local trails here. I am familiar with them and there's so many routes that I can take. Sadly, the bugs are as bad here as they are anywhere else..... Speaker B: They can't be that bad in the fall right? I hope? Do you camp most every weekend?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n2. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n3. Speaker B dislikes bugs and is not a fan of camping, hiking, or the outdoors.\n4. Speaker A enjoys camping trips and looking for wild animals in the woods.\n5. Speaker A leads hikes for the group they camp with, which are usually an hour or two long.\n6. Speaker A is nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I actually try to camp as often as I can during the summer months. It's a great way to disconnect and recharge. Plus, I love looking for wild animals in the woods. But I totally get your aversion to bugs. Maybe we can plan a camping trip for the cooler months when the bugs are less active.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks a strong connection for a top score. A few memory points are pertinent and useful for generating the next response, such as Speaker B's dislike of bugs and the outdoors (#3), which relates directly to the conversation about hiking and camping in bug-filled weather. Additionally, Speaker A's familiarity and enjoyment in leading hikes (#5) also provide some background to their current hiking stories in the context. However, other points in the MEMORY like Speaker B's recent hike enjoyment (#1) and their nervousness about the Appalachian Trail (#6) aren't directly connected to the current context, hence they don't significantly build on the conversation development. Overall, the MEMORY is helpful in parts, though not comprehensive or seamlessly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, thus earning a mid-range score."
