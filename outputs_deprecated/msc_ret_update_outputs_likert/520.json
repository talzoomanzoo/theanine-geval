Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer? Speaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods.\n2. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo.\n3. Speaker B is waiting for bands to announce their summer tour schedule to plan which shows to attend.\n4. Speaker A is planning to visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend.\n5. Speaker B recommends visiting the Museum of Art of São Paulo in the city.\n6. Speaker B enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food and live music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains several helpful pieces of information that could assist in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. Sentence 2 (Speaker A is interested in music concerts) is directly relevant to the current conversation about music concerts and could guide Speaker A's response to Speaker B's concert experience.\n2. Sentence 3 (Speaker B is waiting for bands to announce summer tour schedules) provides context on Speaker B's interest in concerts, which could be relevant to continuing the dialogue about music events.\n3. Sentence 4 (Speaker A is planning to visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo) directly correlates with the ongoing dialogue about art museums, allowing for a smooth transition in the conversation.\n4. Sentence 5 (Speaker B recommends visiting the Museum of Art of São Paulo) could be leveraged in the dialogue if Speaker B is to offer more opinions or recommendations on museums, which aligns with the current dialog piece.\n5. While sentence 1 (Speaker A enjoys museums and food) and sentence 6 (Speaker B enjoys city life) provide additional context, they are not as immediately relevant to this specific dialogue. However, they are naturally phrased and not disruptive.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides a helpful framework for understanding past interactions and interests of both speakers, which can guide potential responses in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
