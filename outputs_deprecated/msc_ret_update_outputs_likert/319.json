Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming? Speaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both. Speaker A: That sounds interesting. That's great that you love your job, not many people do.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates.\n2. Speaker A enjoys reading books about ice cream, Disney World, and computers.\n3. Speaker A works for a small local business with a demanding schedule.\n4. Speaker A is considering a career in dentistry but is also interested in working at Disney for happiness.\n5. Speaker B's mother is a dentist and loves her job.\n6. Speaker A is torn between choosing a career in dentistry for the money or working at Disney for happiness.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, I feel fortunate to enjoy what I do. It's important to find fulfillment in your work, don't you think?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information to understand Speaker B's situation and potentially guide the conversation. It mentions that Speaker B works for a computer company (sentence 1), which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as it corroborates Speaker B's statements. However, it introduces an aspect (unable to change careers until their child graduates) that could lead to probing questions, yet this information is not directly leveraged in the ongoing dialogue.\n\nThe details about Speaker A's interests and career considerations (sentences 2-4, 6) provide background context that might drive future interactions but are not directly tied to the current job discussion. Sentence 5 about Speaker B's mother being a dentist appears somewhat out of context and does not add to the current dialogue flow.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY contains relevant information, but the connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT are not fully optimized, though the structure is somewhat clear and assists a language model in making some inferences."
