    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there? Speaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay? Speaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately? Speaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"' Speaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history. Speaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing?  Speaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha. Speaker A: Young people today really have different values than our generation had. Acting sounds like it would be personally rewarding. I also like the arts. I play guitar and piano. You mentioned that you have a poll. That sounds refreshing in the hot weather.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n2. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\n4. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n5. Both Speaker A's mother and Speaker A were librarians, but Speaker A is retired.\n6. Speaker A finds getting old no fun and jokes about the inevitability of grey hair.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Playing guitar and piano must be so fun! It's great to have music as a hobby. I bet you have some great stories from your days as a librarian too!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains a few details that could potentially relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but they are not directly helpful or relevant for generating a next response. For example, point 1 and 2 about spring break and Easter weekend could be marginally relevant if the conversation shifts towards future plans or holidays, but they do not connect directly to the current context about travel plans, books, or personal interests like theatre or music. Point 4, regarding the type of book, could relate to the earlier part of the conversation about historical fiction, but it's not particularly helpful for Speaker B's next response. The rest of the points in MEMORY do not pertain to the current themes or topics discussed in the dialogue, and therefore do not offer significant contextual cues for generating a relevant response. Overall, while some points could vaguely fit the conversation, they lack direct relevance and clear connections to the immediate context."
