    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week? Speaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you? Speaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions? Speaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like? Speaker A: I like all kinds of games. I like party, fighting, RPGs, shooters, action, adventure, and puzzle games. I enjoy playing Jurassic Park: World but I'd like to find another game to play. The storm means I'll be inside for a bit, so I think I'll curl up with some pizza and just zone out. Do you like to do anything else besides game when it's rainy? Speaker B: Well, I might help around the house with cleaning or laundry, but not that much. Mostly gaming. If I feel I sat too long, I'll switch to Nintendo Switch's Ring Fit Adventure to get my body moving a bit. Do yo know that game?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n2. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n3. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n4. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy playing video games in their free time.\n6. Speaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've heard of Ring Fit Adventure, it's a great way to stay active while gaming. I might give it a try sometime. I usually just stick to playing games on my console or PC, but it's good to have some variety. I might look into some new games to try out soon.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does offer some relevant information about Speaker A's and Speaker B's preferences and past interactions regarding video games, including mentions of Speaker A's interest in Jurassic Park: World and Speaker B's enjoyment of Resident Evil. However, some details are either redundant or lacking in clarity and connection with the present dialogue context. The memory could benefit from organization emphasizing connections and development of past interactions more clearly. The mention of \"Speaker B recently bought Resident Evil VIII\" is not reflected in the dialogue and could misguide if not cross-referenced with other needed cues. The overall useful detail is present but interspersed with less or partially relevant elements, hence a middle-range score."
