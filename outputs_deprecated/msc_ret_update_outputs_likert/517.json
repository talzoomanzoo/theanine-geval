Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well? Speaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon? Speaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now! Speaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her? Speaker A: I think so.  She seems like a very sweet girl and she seems to care deeply about my son, so that's what matters most.  You know, maybe I can stop by and visit you as well, since you live in Europe.  France, Spain, Italy?  Where are you living now? Speaker B: Bless her, that's good to hear. That would be great! I live in Portugal. It's not too far from Spain. We can always arrange something. How long would you be there for? Speaker A: I'm planning to stay in Spain for three weeks.  Since you live in Portugal, I'd love to stop by for a visit if you're free this coming month.  I've always wanted to visit Lisbon.  It has the world's longest bridge! Speaker B: That'a great idea. We have a holiday house just outside of Lisbon. You are welcome to lodge with us. Speaker A: Sounds great!  I'm already very excited about my trip to Spain, and now I get to visit you in Lisbon!  I need to brush up on my Spanish and also start studying Portuguese. Speaker B: Haha, you've got your hands full then. Portuguese would be easier I believe. Spanish is a bit harder because it is spoken quicker. Would you be travelling with any company?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next.\n2. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour.\n3. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\n4. Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away.\n5. Speaker A's boys are leaving again in a few months for another trip after studying abroad.\n6. Speaker B has two sons, one who loves Chinese food like Speaker A, and the other who prefers Italian food.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'll be traveling alone for this trip. It will be nice to have some time to relax and catch up with my son and his girlfriend in Spain, and then I can enjoy some quality time with you and your family in Portugal. It's going to be an unforgettable winter break!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information about both speakers' sons and their travel experiences, which is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they discuss travel and plans in Europe. However, the MEMORY is not well-structured or strongly connected to the specific details of the ongoing dialogue. Much of the information is focused on the sons' preferences and activities, which does not necessarily help Speaker A generate a relevant response related to Speaker B's questions about visiting Europe or the prospects of meeting the girlfriend. The MEMORY lacks a clear development of past interactions that would be pertinent to the current conversation, such as previous discussions about trips or specific countries mentioned like Portugal or cities like Lisbon. Thus, while there are glimpses of related information, it is not organized in a way that directly aids the language model in the given context."
