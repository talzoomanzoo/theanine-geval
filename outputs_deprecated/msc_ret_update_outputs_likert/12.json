Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n2. Speaker B is looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing.\n3. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n4. Speaker A finds swimming relaxing and uses it to destress from their job.\n5. Speaker A knows how to swim since the age of 5.\n6. Speaker B enjoys cruising in their car while listening to punk music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Don't worry, I'll make sure to start with the basics and help you feel comfortable in the water. Plus, with some punk music playing in the background, you'll be cruising through the pool in no time!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant context for Speaker A's playlist setup, which includes punk music for swimming and programming activities. Specifically, it highlights Speaker B's enjoyment of punk music and interest in swimming and programming (sentences 1 and 2), which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, some sentences in MEMORY are less directly relevant to the context, such as Speaker A's personal experiences with swimming (sentences 4 and 5) and Speaker B's interest in cruising while listening to punk music (sentence 6). These details don't directly influence the immediate task of responding to the conversation about the playlist. While the sentences are naturally structured, not all contribute equally to generating a next response, resulting in a moderate score of 3."
