Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you. Speaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n2. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n4. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n5. Speaker A plays the clarinet in a band concert and has a solar investment for their office building.\n6. Speaker A's parents are teachers.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds lovely! I'll definitely consider plum and pear trees for my garden. Do you have any tips on how to care for them during the different seasons?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a mix of relevant and less relevant information for generating a proper next response. The most useful memory item is (1), which establishes Speaker B's knowledge about plants and gardening, directly supporting B's suggestion of plum and pear trees. Additionally, (2) is indirectly relevant by indicating Speaker A's struggle with gardening, which aligns with their request for suggestions. The remaining memory items (3, 4, 5, 6) are less relevant to the current topic of gardening or the specific plant recommendations, and do not contribute significantly to the dialogue context. However, they are phrased in a clear and structured manner, which distinguishes them as not directly beneficial but not entirely irrelevant to the speakersâ€™ general background. This structure earns the MEMORY a moderate score of 3."
