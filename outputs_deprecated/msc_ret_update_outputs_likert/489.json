    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work? Speaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n3. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n4. Speaker B's neighbor, John, is getting divorced and selling top-of-the-line camping gear.\n5. Speaker A will use the money earned from the store to buy the hammock online.\n6. Speaker A plans to bring sandwiches and fruit for the hike, specifically asking about veggie sandwiches for Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great! It's always nice to have some extra cash coming in. Maybe John can hook you up with some top-of-the-line camping gear for your hiking trip.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several pieces of relevant and helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Memory point 1 is particularly helpful as it connects to Speaker A's job at the grocery store and indicates the location's proximity to a hiking trail, which adds context to Speaker A's interest in the store's location. Memory point 2 is also useful as it reinforces the notion that the store has nice people, aligning with Speaker A's mention of liking the store's atmosphere. Memory points 3 and 5 provide background on Speaker A's motivations and how they plan to use the money earned, which could be relevant if the conversation shifts towards financial goals or lifestyle choices. Memory point 6 can be potentially relevant if the conversation turns towards hiking plans, indicating Speaker A's plans to invite Speaker B on a hike.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is structured and relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, demonstrating natural connections that can aid the language model in crafting an appropriate response. However, some points, such as Memory point 4, do not directly contribute to the context and can be seen as less relevant.\n"
