Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?

Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future? Speaker B: I would love to get back to Italy but need to save up and the hopeful priority is to Greece this year.  You have friends in Europe are you in contact to see what plans you can make?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology.\n2.

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds exciting! Yes, I've been in touch with my friends, and we're planning to explore different cities in Italy together. It's going to be a fantastic trip filled with history and amazing architecture. Your interest in Greece is inspiring. I hope you get to visit the Greek islands soon and immerse yourself in the mythology you love so much.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information, but not all of it is clearly relevant or well-connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. The first sentence in MEMORY is slightly helpful because it mentions Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology and visiting Greece, aligning with the context of Greek mythology discussed.\n2. The second sentence in MEMORY aligns with the context of Speaker A planning a trip to Italy, but not entirely accurate based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about traveling alone and meeting European friends which isn't directly stated.\n3. The third sentence details Speaker A's interest in Italian architecture and history, which could provide context for travel-related discussions but doesn't directly relate to the current dialogue.\n4. The fourth sentence offers background on Speaker B's past experience in Italy, complementing the discussion on travel but not directly impacting the immediate conversation.\n5. The fifth sentence includes Speaker B's passion for Greek mythology and a specific interest in Poseidon, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about mythology but isn't directly referenced in the conversation.\n6. The sixth sentence about California is not relevant to this DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY contains some relevant points, particularly regarding Speaker B's interest in Greece and mythology, but lacks cohesive structure and direct relevance throughout."
