Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you? Speaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses. Speaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set? Speaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up. Speaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe? Speaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood. Speaker A: Chemicals!  Do the actors hate working with it then?  I can imagine they are a pretty high maintenance bunch.  Do they worry about the blood messing with their looks? Speaker B: Our actors are pretty amateur.  No big name ones so they are really good to work with.  Hey, how about you?  How is your interview practice going?  I am pretty sure you be excellent during it! Speaker A: I think this discussion is helping me with making small talk, so thanks.  I just have to try and remember who i am and try to sell my good points. Speaker B: That is a good approach.  I suppose you have been doing research on the company you are interviewing with?  I find it always helps to know the company as best you can for an interview.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n2. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.\n3. Speaker A is preparing for an upcoming interview and is nervous about it.\n4. Speaker A has recently received a call for a job interview and is excited about it.\n5. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n6. Speaker A is nervous about an upcoming interview and wishes for a government job like Speaker B's.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, I've been researching non-stop. It's essential to show them how passionate I am about their work and how I can contribute. I appreciate the encouragement, and I'll definitely keep practicing my pitch until I nail it during the interview.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could aid in generating a response for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Here's a breakdown:\n\n- Memory 1 and Memory 2 provide context about Speaker B's involvement in making horror movies, which aligns with the discussion in the dialogue context about Speaker B's work in horror movie production. Additionally, Memory 1 details a creative process with their dad, which adds depth to the conversation about creative fulfillment and would be helpful in formulating further responses around career and family influences.\n\n- Memory 3, Memory 4, and Memory 6 are pertinent to Speaker A's current concern about their interview, as previously mentioned in the conversation. This can help create responses that encourage or relate to Speaker A's interview experience.\n\n- Memory 5 talks about Speaker A's interest in mid-century design and horror movies, which, although not directly part of the dialogue context, provides a broader understanding of Speaker A's creative inclinations.\n\nHowever, the connections between sentences in MEMORY could be structured better to demonstrate a clear development and relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the individual pieces of information are generally relevant, they are somewhat disjointed and lack a seamless narrative that clearly supports the ongoing conversation about work fulfillment and career paths in a coherent manner."
