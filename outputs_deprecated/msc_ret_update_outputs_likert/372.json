Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? Speaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month Speaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation? Speaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there! Speaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n2. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo.\n4. Speaker A enjoys seeing pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister.\n5. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n6. Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I've been to San Diego Zoo a couple of times, and it's amazing! They have a fantastic variety of animals, especially the pandas and penguins. It's definitely worth a visit if you enjoy zoos.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant pieces of information that would assist in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 5 directly connects to Speaker Bâ€™s contemplation about adopting a kitten, which is a part of the ongoing conversation. Additionally, Sentence 1 touches on Speaker B's interest in visiting the zoo, which is relevant to the current focus on Speaker B's upcoming vacation to San Diego and the mention of visiting the zoo there. \n\nHowever, other sentences provide limited direct benefit regarding the immediate context of the conversation, such as Speaker A's preferences regarding zoo animals (Sentence 4) or pets (Sentence 6), which aren't directly relevant to the current topic of discussion. Some sentences (e.g., 2, 3) give peripheral context but do so in a way that isn't directly related or necessary for the immediate next reply. Therefore, while the MEMORY is structured in readability, it only partially aids in producing a next response fitting for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
