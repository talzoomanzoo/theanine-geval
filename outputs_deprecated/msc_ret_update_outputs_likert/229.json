Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A suggested the name Zhao for one of the kittens.\n2. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n3. Speaker B has an older mellow cat and is concerned about training the new energetic kittens.\n4. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n5. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n6. Speaker B lives in the city they grew up in, loves animals, and has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I've been thinking of naming them based on their personalities. I've decided on Zhao for one of them. What do you think?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding kitten names. Specifically, Memory 1 is directly relevant as it mentions a name suggested by Speaker A, Zhao, which connects with the context of discussing kitten names. Memory 2 also adds context about Speaker B's intention to give the kittens Mandarin names based on their personalities, which is relevant to the naming discussion. Memory 3, although related to Speaker B's concerns about training, offers character background knowledge that could influence the conversation. Memories 4, 5, and 6, while not directly relevant to naming, provide background on the speakers, facilitating a deeper understanding of the setting and their interests. Overall, the memories are naturally structured, mostly connected to the topic, and allow for identifying useful contextual cues. There could be slightly tighter connection in all memories to the kitten naming theme for a perfect score."
