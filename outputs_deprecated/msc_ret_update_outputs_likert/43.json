Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden. Speaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways? Speaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there? Speaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot.  Speaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden? Speaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends. Speaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going? Speaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery. Speaker A: Does that add a lot of extra work to your plate? Speaker B: At the moment, yes. I'll be in Pediatrics, which has always been my passion. It's a completely different environment than the ER. Speaker A: Oh wow! That is so exciting for you. Will you get to stay in pediatrics after the training is complete?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n4. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n5. Speaker B's parents still live in Sweden, and they find it expensive to travel there.\n6. Speaker B attends a Methodist church, was not raised with religion in Sweden, and moved to the United States for a job opportunity in medicine.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, that's the plan! I hope to stay in Pediatrics long-term. The thought of making a difference in a child's life is what keeps me going.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided includes relevant information but also contains some inaccuracies or irrelevant points. For instance, sentences 2 and 3 correctly identify Speaker A's cousin in Sweden, which is mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, and sentence 4 reveals Speaker B's fondness for Sweden, aligning with their plans to return. However, sentence 1 incorrectly states that Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel together, which contradicts the context. Sentence 5 mentions Speaker B's parents living in Sweden, but this is not relevant to the current dialogue about Speaker A's trip. Sentence 6 contains information about Speaker B's past and religious background, which, while interesting, is not directly related to the conversation about the trip or Speaker B's job in pediatrics. The MEMORY does provide some helpful context but lacks cohesion and accuracy, leading to a moderate score."
