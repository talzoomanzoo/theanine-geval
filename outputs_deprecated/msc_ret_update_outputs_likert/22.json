Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n2. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n3. Speaker B is considering giving up their night job to focus on lab work and school.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the challenges and rewards of having a dog with hearing issues.\n6. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context is about the cloning of a cow and Speaker B's plans regarding it. The MEMORY appropriately indicates that Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology (Sentence 1), works in a lab (Sentence 2), and is considering focusing more on lab work (Sentence 3), which aligns well with the given topic of cloning—a lab-related activity. This indicates Speaker B's dedication and interest in their scientific pursuits, which is relevant for generating a response. The other sentences, while not directly related to the context of cow cloning, are naturally phrased and provide a deeper understanding of Speaker B’s life and interests, such as their differing fields of work with Speaker A (Sentence 4) and their mutual interest in cooking (Sentence 6). Sentence 5 is less relevant but still provides background on Speaker A and Speaker B's past discussions, potentially enriching the conversation. Overall, the MEMORY helps indicate Speaker B's inclination toward science and research, making it useful for the context of the dialogue."
