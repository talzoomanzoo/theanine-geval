Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships! Speaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field? Speaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate? Speaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n2. Speaker B is looking for internships in the sports medicine field and has asked professors for letters of recommendation.\n3. Speaker B is interested in sports medicine and enjoys surfing.\n4. Speaker A suggests that surfing could be a way for Speaker B to make connections in the medical field.\n5. Speaker A enjoys hiking along the coast and collecting shells, mentioning that their knees can't handle much else.\n6. Speaker B is studying sports medicine and plays soccer, looking to join their college team in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's great that you're already planning ahead for internships. As for my knees, it's just wear and tear from years of hiking and being active. Surfing could be a good way for you to relax and network. Have you tried reaching out to any sports medicine clinics or local teams for internship opportunities?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not perfectly aligned and lacks clear development or causality between the interactions. Points 1 and 2 are somewhat aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as they mention advice and support regarding internships and the field of sports medicine, which are part of the ongoing conversation. However, points 3, 4, and 5 introduce new activities and suggestions that are not directly connected to the context, such as surfing and hiking, neither directly mentioned in the dialogue. These additional elements might cause confusion regarding their relevance without clear connections or transitions to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Point 6 is relevant in terms of Speaker B's studies and goals, but it too lacks integration or a direct link to the ongoing dialogue. Overall, while MEMORY provides a broad understanding of past interactions, it misses some opportunity to be tightly aligned with the current conversation progression in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
