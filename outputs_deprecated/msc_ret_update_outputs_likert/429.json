Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha! Speaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes? Speaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe.  Speaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm?  Speaker B: I'll be living off campus, so absolutely. How about you? Are you staying in the dorms? Speaker A: I'm glad your taking them with you. My mum wants me to stay in dorms. But I think I just want my own place, less drama and more freedom that way.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n3. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n4. Speaker B goes to Hawaii for scuba diving and is considering studying marine life or a different type of animal.\n5. Speaker B has an interest in diving and is planning to take neuroscience classes using the GI Bill.\n6. Speaker B is a veteran who went to the army after high school, interested in neuroscience and seeking advice on studying it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a good plan. Having your own place definitely has its perks. Plus, you'll have the freedom to focus on your studies without any distractions. And it's great that you can bring your pets along for the adventure!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information related to Speaker B's character and background, which could be useful for generating responses. For example, Speaker B has two snakes named Hensel and Gretel (related to the context of having pet snakes), and they've served in the army and are interested in neuroscience (provides depth to Speaker B's interests mentioned in the dialogue). However, certain details like Speaker B scuba diving in Hawaii, and Speaker A volunteering at a lab do not directly connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY includes interesting facts but lacks a consistent connection or relevance that directly supports the immediate flow of the dialogue. Thus, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but contains elements that seem less connected to the current conversation."
