Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me. Speaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n2. Speaker A is nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes.\n3. Speaker A leads hikes for the group they camp with, which are usually an hour or two long.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy being outdoors, but Speaker B prefers the fresh air over being in the mud and rain.\n5. Speaker B dislikes bugs and is not a fan of camping, hiking, or the outdoors.\n6. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "They did! I think they enjoyed the change of scenery and fresh air. It's always nice to get out and explore, even if it's not something you do often.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could help Speaker A generate a response in the context of discussing hiking and outdoor activities. For example, items #4 and #5 indicate that Speaker B dislikes bugs, camping, and hiking, which aligns with Speaker B's statement in the dialogue about not being a fan of the outdoors. This could inform Speaker A's response by acknowledging Speaker B's preferences or experiences. Additionally, memory item #3 relates to Speaker A leading hikes, which is relevant as they mentioned leading friends on a hike recently. However, other items in MEMORY, such as Speaker B recently enjoying a hike (#1) or Speaker A's plans for the Appalachian Trail (#2, #6), do not directly align with the current focus of the dialogue, which is more about the friends' experience and Speaker B's attitude towards the outdoors. As such, while MEMORY is partially helpful, it is not cohesively structured to fully benefit generating a response."
