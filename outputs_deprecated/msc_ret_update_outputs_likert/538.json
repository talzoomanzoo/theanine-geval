Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?   Speaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere! Speaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it. Speaker A: I don't have recipes but I know how to make a good grilled asparagus. Are you looking to bolster your chef book? Speaker B: I sure am!  Grilled asparagus does sound good.  Do you pair the grilled asparagus with your fajitas?  What do you prefer, chicken or beef fajitas? Speaker A: I prefer chicken to beef. I pair it with beef fajitas andI think it's great to have with a glass of merlot. Do you like wine? Speaker B: You're making me hungry!  Yes, I do love wine.  As a matter of fact, I used to live in the Bordeaux region in France, so my favorite wine is Bordeaux wine.  But I also love champagne and cognac. Speaker A: Haha, I know right? I lived in the Champagne region for a bit! Always wanted to go to Bordeaux. How was it there?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters.\n2. Speaker A enjoys grilling indoors and suggests grilled asparagus with lemon on it.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines.\n4. Speaker A is more interested in science than music, while Speaker B enjoys listening to Black Sabbath and grilling meat.\n5. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n6. Speaker B is interested in becoming a chef but hasn't had the time to apply for jobs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Bordeaux was incredible! The vineyards, the wine, the food - everything was just so rich in flavor. You'd absolutely love it there with your passion for cooking and wine. Maybe we can plan a trip there together one day and explore the culinary delights of the region.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, memory #1 and #5 relate to Speaker A's interest in animal shelters and dogs, which reflects Speaker A's mention of the new cat at the shelter and preferences for puppies in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Memory #2 about grilled asparagus directly ties into the discussion about recipes and cooking in the context, giving Speaker B the idea for the dish they were inquiring about. Additionally, memory #6 aligns with Speaker B's interest in bolstering their chef book, providing context on Speaker B's aspirations. The sentences show coherence and naturally depict the interests and development of the interactions between the speakers. Although some sentences like #3 and #4 provide additional context and character for the speakers, they are well-phrased so that they can easily be identified as less directly beneficial in this context, hence why this receives a strong score of 4."
