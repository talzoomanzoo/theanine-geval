Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast. Speaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project. Speaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on? Speaker B: I'm sure the student appreciate that. You teach as a group as apposed to one-on-one right? And one of the companies I work for had their system hit with a virus so I've been upgraded their software to debug the system. Speaker A: I teach group classes and one on one, but I was the student today. I specialize in jiu-jitsu but today I got to be the student in a taekwondo class.  Speaker B: That's even better, learning is a life-long journey. How are you class on martial art history? When you have time teach me too, I'd love to learn.  Speaker A: It's been a little stressful lately, because finals are coming up...but I'm confident in that class. I could've aced it before I even started! I'll definitely get started with you after finals. Speaker B: Ahaha we;; for someone who's so passionate about martial arts I'm not surprised. Great, I'll try to be the best student I can. I'm starving, think I should grab some take-out from Sufi?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it.\n2. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\n3. Speaker A is a martial arts teacher and student and is pursuing an athletic training degree in college.\n4. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things.\n5. Speaker A is a college student who teaches jiu-jitsu and is lactose intolerant.\n6. Speaker A is interested in trying new restaurants, mentioning Taco Bell as their favorite.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate your enthusiasm for learning martial arts history! Sufi sounds like a great choice for take-out, but have you considered trying the new Taco Bell in town?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided is mostly helpful and relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures important aspects of past interactions between Speakers A and B, such as Speaker A's involvement in martial arts, being both a student and a teacher, and Speaker B's recent engagement with martial arts history classes. These points are pertinent to the current dialogue which revolves around martial arts classes and interests. The MEMORY mentions Speaker A's work towards an athletic training degree, their lactose intolerance, and their favorite restaurant, Taco Bell. Although not directly related to the current context, these details are naturally phrased such that a language model can easily consider them as additional background. Overall, the MEMORY helps in understanding the context and could inform generating an appropriate response, particularly in the continuation of a conversation about martial arts or related topics. A slight improvement could be in making stronger connections or causality lines, particularly linking the restaurant preferences and dietary needs with any discussion points, decreasing slightly from a perfect score."
