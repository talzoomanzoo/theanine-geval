Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes? Speaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try? Speaker B: I mean I always recommend Karate since that's what I study! I can bring you by the dojo sometime if you want to see what it is like.  Speaker A: OMG!! That would be so awesome, Yes please.  When is a good time for you? Speaker B: Awesome! Tomorrow afternoon anytime between 3-6 would work for me! Speaker A: Perfect.

I was thinking that new sandwhich shop by the collage that just opened, what do nyou think? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate.\n2. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.\n3. Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork.\n4. Speaker B enjoys water-related activities and movies like \"Jaws\".\n5. Speaker A has a love for seafood and imagines wanting to eat fish while watching them swim.\n6.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as it offers insights into Speaker B's involvement in karate and their background in other activities, which relates to the ongoing conversation about martial arts. However, much of the MEMORY contains details that are not directly relevant to the immediate context of visiting the dojo or planning the lunch, such as Speaker A's love for seafood or Speaker B's enjoyment of movies. While these are structured in a natural way, they do not significantly aid the generation of the next conversational response. The MEMORY does reflect the broader context of prior interactions, but some elements are not as helpful for the specific next steps in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
