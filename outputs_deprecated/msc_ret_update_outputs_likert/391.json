    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes.  Speaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n2. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n3. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n4. Speaker A is worried about the raccoon potentially eating the bearded dragon.\n5. Speaker A hears raccoons and cats fighting in their neighborhood.\n6. Raccoons are known for being able to escape despite efforts to secure trash containers.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm a bit hesitant about befriending the raccoons. I'm just worried about potential conflicts with other pets in the neighborhood, like my bearded dragon. It's good to hear that Bandicoot is so clever though!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could help a language model generate a proper response to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it's not well-organized or completely aligned with the context. Sentence 1 is relevant as it mentions the aluminum sheeting and Speaker A's raccoon problem, aligning well with the immediate context. However, there is a discrepancy since Speaker A has already bought the sheeting, not just planning to buy it. Sentence 2 and Sentence 3 loosely relate to the conversation; they provide context on Speaker B's perspective on raccoons, which is useful in understanding their suggestion about befriending raccoons. Sentences 4 and 5 are not directly related to the present dialogue context but do add background about Speaker A's experiences with raccoons, which could inform their reluctance to befriend them. Sentence 6 is a general fact about raccoons that relates to the conversation about their intelligence but is not specifically helpful in this context. Overall, the MEMORY provides some useful information but lacks cohesion and relevance needed for a higher score."
