Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim.  Speaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n2. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n3. Speaker B is looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing.\n4. Speaker A knows how to swim since the age of 5.\n5. Speaker A finds swimming relaxing and uses it to destress from their job.\n6. Speaker B is interested in learning programming and is already practicing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that can aid a language model in generating an appropriate response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY includes details relevant to the context, such as Speaker B's enjoyment of punk music and their interest in learning programming (as seen in points 1 and 6), which aligns with the playlist creation and study session mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, Speaker A's offer to teach swimming (point 2) ties in well with their conversation about swimming and Speaker B's desire to learn. Points 4 and 5 provide background information on Speaker A's swimming ability and their personal reasons for swimming, which, though not directly linked to the current dialogue, enrich the understanding of Speaker A's character. Point 3, though a more tangential detail, still aligns with the playful and fun aspect of the meetup. Overall, the MEMORY sentences are clearly structured and logically connected, facilitating the identification of relevant cues for Speaker B's response development."
