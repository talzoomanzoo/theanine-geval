Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad. Speaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs! Speaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours? Speaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock?  Speaker B: I guess I was going to get like an umbrella table and some chairs to go with it or maybe even a screened in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle. Speaker A: That's a great idea! Sounds like a very nice place for a barbeque. What were you planning on grilling for the barbeque?  Speaker B: I'll get the steaks to grill if you will bring the corn. And I have a request for you to play on the guitar, I know you are into country so if you could maybe play a song or two by Miranda Lambert, that would be awesome.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n2. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy barbecuing and have a love for pets.\n4. Speaker B plans to grill steaks this weekend and prefers using an old charcoal grill over a gas one.\n5. Speaker B plans to bring a new marinade and a six pack of beer for the gathering.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I can definitely play some Miranda Lambert songs for you, no problem! I'm excited for the barbecue, and I'll make sure to bring the corn. It sounds like it's going to be a fantastic evening with good food, music, and company. Can't wait!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided several points relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B planning to grill steaks and the discussion involving furniture and home decor. This information aligns with the context of the barbecue gathering. However, while there are details related to the barbecue and furniture, many of the sentences are somewhat generic and do not provide a strong sense of interaction development or causality. For instance, the mention of the love for pets, while characteristic, does not relate directly to the immediate conversation about the barbecue. Additionally, the MEMORY does not clearly convey whether the gathering with music, food, and company is a new or ongoing plan or event. Overall, the MEMORY includes relevant information but lacks clarity and depth that could give a language model specific cues about past interactions or significantly enhance the conversational context."
