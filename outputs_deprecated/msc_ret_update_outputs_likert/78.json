    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments.\n2. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n3. Speaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\n4. Speaker A's other children are addicted to tablets and phones, unlike the youngest one who is interested in music.\n5. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n6. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a nice way to keep things personal. Speaking of which, have you tried introducing your grandkids to any traditional hobbies or activities like fishing?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several facts relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B having grandkids and their interests in technology (MEMORY 1, 2, 3, 6). This is directly related to the context where Speaker A is asking about Speaker B's interaction with grandchildren through technology. Though not all entries are directly relevant (like information about Speaker A's kids), overall, the MEMORY offers a coherent background about Speaker B's preferences and experiences related to grandchildren and technology. This helps a language model understand the dynamics and develop a suitable response."
