Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it? Speaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see.  Speaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself? Speaker B: I was in Greece last two years ago.   I am excited to go again soon!    At somepoint I would like to take a cruise around the islands there.  It seems like a neat way to see all the Islands in an easy way.   Have you ever taken a cruise?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece.\n2. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\n3. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five.\n4. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian.\n5. Speaker B asks Speaker A if their trip is more for relaxation or sightseeing.\n6. Speaker A has traveled around Europe before, visiting capital cities of each country.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've never taken a cruise, but it sounds like a fantastic way to explore the Greek islands! The idea of sailing around and hopping from one beautiful island to the next definitely sounds like a dream. Do you have a favorite island in Greece that you'd recommend visiting first?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 1 is directly related to the conversation about Greece and the Acropolis in Athens, which Speaker B recommends visiting. This is helpful in understanding Speaker B's interests in Greek historical sites. However, the rest of the sentences (2-6) are not directly related to the conversation at hand. While they provide some context about Speaker B's interest in Greece, they do not aid in generating a response related to the Acropolis or excursions. The memory lacks a clear structure demonstrating the development of the conversation, as it includes unrelated or indirectly related information. Nonetheless, the included sentences are naturally structured, allowing the language model to discern the relevance of the content. Thus, while the memory is not fully aligned with the dialogue context, it has some degree of utility."
