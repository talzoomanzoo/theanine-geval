Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it. Speaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it. Speaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping? Speaker B: I love being out in the wilderness and sleeping under the stars in the fresh air. It makes you realize how beautiful life is and how small we really are in comparison to the universe.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\n2. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n3. Speaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat.\n4. Speaker B plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge for college applications.\n5. Speaker B is a member of the boy scouts and works at a fast food place\n6. Speaker A is involved in church activities and mentioned a church retreat\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like such a peaceful experience. Nature has a way of putting things into perspective, doesn't it? It's great to hear how much you enjoy it. You know, our church retreat also focuses on connecting with nature and finding inner peace. You might find it to be a nice complement to your scouting adventures.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, Memory 2 and Memory 4 indicate Speaker B's deep involvement and commitment to Boy Scouts, which aligns with the current conversation topic about Boy Scouts and camping. Additionally, Memory 1 and Memory 6 mention Speaker A's involvement in organizing or participating in activities, which could relate to their interest in engaging their kids in similar activities, like the Boy Scouts. However, other parts of the MEMORY, such as B's involvement in tennis and work at a fast food place (Memories 3 and 5), do not directly relate to the conversation about Boy Scouts and camping. These could be rephrased to demonstrate better connectivity between the speakers. While there is some helpful information, the MEMORY as a whole could be better structured to more clearly show the relevance and connection to the specific conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
