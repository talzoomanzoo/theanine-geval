Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there? Speaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay? Speaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n2. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n3. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n4. Speaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\n5. Speaker A, a retired librarian, recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit.\n6. Speaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm doing well, thank you! I recently finished \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter. It's a perfect beach read with a captivating storyline. Have you heard of it?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B going on a trip, which connects with the plane ticket discussion. However, some of the details about the trip, like not having started packing (sentence 1), do not help generate a next response. The mention of the new car and plans to drive during spring break (sentence 4) is somewhat relevant as it relates to travel, but less so to their current dialogue about Costa Rica. The parts about Speaker B's spring break excitement (sentence 3) and Speaker A's quiet spring breaks (sentence 2) offer context but don't directly pertain to planning for Costa Rica. Information about Speaker A being a retired librarian and recommending a book (sentence 5) hints at A's personality but isn't directly useful for generating responses about the trip to Costa Rica. Sentence 6 seems out of context as they are discussing plane trips specifically, not car travel. Overall, while the MEMORY contains interesting context, it only offers partial assistance to the model in generating dialogue related to the current context."
