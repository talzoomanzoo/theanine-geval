Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that? Speaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading? Speaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha. Speaker B: Well if it's any good I know you'll be watching the whole thing.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n2. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n3. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n4. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n5. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n6. Speaker A enjoys watching Jeopardy with their grandchildren and cooking for them, with the busiest time being the weekend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Oh, absolutely! If it's as gripping as the book, I'll probably binge-watch it in one sitting. It's the perfect way to unwind after a busy weekend with the grandkids.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides somewhat helpful information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It offers details such as Speaker A having grandchildren, their preference for watching certain types of Netflix shows, and a shared interest in animals between the two speakers. Some of these points, like Speaker A having grandchildren and their habits with them, are relevant to the conversation and can help in generating a natural and informed response. However, certain details (such as specifics about Netflix show ratings) don't directly contribute to the immediate context around their discussion of books and a potential film adaptation. Additionally, while memory notes Speaker B's fascination with animals, it would be more helpful if it contained more about Speaker B's specific preferences in books or how this relates to their current conversation. The information is structured coherently, but not all of it connects directly to the conversation at hand, which limits its helpfulness somewhat."
