Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended.  Speaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along! Speaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them. Speaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n2. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n3. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot.\n4. Speaker A suggested the name Zhao for one of the kittens.\n5. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n6. Speaker A's parrot Tasha has seen cats before and ignores them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a mix of information that is somewhat related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it lacks direct helpfulness in generating an immediate response within the ongoing conversation. \n\n1. Relevant Points: \n   - Sentences 1 and 2 confirm that Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten, which directly ties into the conversation about adopting animals and the potential interaction between cats and the parrot.\n   - Sentence 6 provides additional context about Tasha's behavior towards cats, which may help in understanding the dynamics mentioned in the dialogue.\n   \n2. Irrelevant or Unutilized Points:\n   - Sentences 3 and 4 introduce facts about training and names for the kittens, but these details are not directly engaged in the current context of the dialogue.\n   - Sentence 5, which talks about Speaker B's adoption paperwork and naming preferences, doesn't appear relevant to the current flow of conversation and doesn't offer information that would inform a response to Speaker B's last question about hiking.\n\nThe sentences related to the conversationâ€™s themes (rescue kittens and Tasha the parrot) are useful, but their phrasing does not entirely align with the natural flow or the immediate needs of the dialogue. The memory could benefit from clearer connections directly addressing the ongoing conversation or directly assist in formulating the next response, thus the rating is a 3."
