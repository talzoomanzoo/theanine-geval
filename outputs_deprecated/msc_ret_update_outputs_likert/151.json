Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping? Speaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp? Speaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer? Speaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping? Speaker B: We usually do tents but we have camped in yurts too. Did you go to the zoo last weekend? Speaker A: I see. Yes, I did make it to the zoo.  Have you gone to your local zoo? Speaker B: I went to the Bronx zoo it was amazing! Did you get to see Joshua? Speaker A: I think the Bronx Zoo is one of the best in the country.   Yes, I did see Joshua.  Did you use a season pass for the zoo or just a one time ticket?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n2. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys.\n3. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n4. Speaker B is interested in finding family discounts for the zoo.\n5. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n6. Speaker A has a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo, particularly to see the tiger named Joshua.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information that could assist a language model in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, it is not entirely comprehensive or directly relevant in all aspects. \n\n1. The MEMORY highlights that Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and sees tigers, including a specific tiger named Joshua. This aligns with the context where Speaker A mentions visiting the zoo and seeing Joshua, which is beneficial for creating a connected response.\n\n2. Speaker B's parenting role is mentioned, as well as interests in family discounts and field trips to the zoo, which could be relevant when discussing zoo visits, although this context isn't directly brought up in the current dialogue.\n\n3. Some of the information concerning Speaker A's weekly zoo visits is not addressed in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Similarly, Speaker A's possession of a kitten is not related to the ongoing dialogue flow.\n\n4. The MEMORY is structured in a way that connects the information regarding the zoo preferences and has a sense of coherency, which can allow a language model to identify helpful cues for upcoming responses even if not all content is immediately relevant.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY contains useful information that could guide responses about the zoo, but it lacks comprehensive connectivity with the specific details in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
