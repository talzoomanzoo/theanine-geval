Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n2. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n3. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n4. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n5. Speaker A is a college student studying Humanities and wants to finish college before looking for a job.\n6. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about the soccer context, such as Speaker B's involvement in college soccer and fandom for Manchester United, which could be useful for generating a response related to collegiate or professional soccer interests. However, most of the MEMORY focuses on details about Speaker A, such as their position, scoring prowess, and fandom for Arsenal, which are not directly related to Speaker B's interaction. The memories are somewhat connected but do not offer much development or deeper insight into past interactions between the speakers. The memory about Speaker A studying Humanities and career plans is not relevant to the dialogue context. Overall, while there is some useful information, it is limited and lacks strong relevance to the specific question Speaker A posed."
