Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends? Speaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do. Speaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars. Speaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there, \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n2. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n3. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n5. Speaker A mentions that Alaska has mountains and glaciers, unsure if skiing is possible there.\n6. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's interesting about the daylight cycles in Alaska! Camping under the stars during the dark months sounds like a unique experience. And yes, trying some delicious Alaskan ice cream sounds like a must-do on the trip. I'm sure we'll find plenty of fun activities to keep us busy while we're there.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains some helpful information that relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but also includes details that are not directly relevant. Items 1, 2, 3, and 5 include useful context about Speaker A and Speaker B's perceptions and questions about Alaska, such as questions about outdoor activities, the conditions in Alaska, and the uncertainty about possibilities for skiing. However, these sentences could be phrased in a more coherent way to indicate their connection to each other. Meanwhile, item 4 suggests a joint plan that isn't apparent in the current dialogue context, and item 6 provides a general statement but lacks detail. While these details can provide some context for Speaker A's potential response, they aren't all directly or clearly connected to the current dialogue context about daylight, dog sledding, or camping. Thus, MEMORY is partly helpful but not fully aligned or elaborately connected to the current discussion."
