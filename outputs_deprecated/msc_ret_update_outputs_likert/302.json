Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods. Speaker B: Oh that sounds fun!

Do you ever consider any foods to be good for healing? I find that you do healing very fascinating!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B expressed interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A.\n2.

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad you find healing methods fascinating! Actually, some people believe in the healing properties of certain foods. For example, bone broth is said to be good for gut health and overall well-being. Have you ever tried bone broth before?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is mostly not useful for generating a coherent and contextually relevant response. For example, while MEMORY 1 mentions healing methods, it doesn't provide any details or context that could help develop a specific response related to Speaker B's interest in healing. The other memories about Speaker A's brother, salsa dancing, and being on the water do not relate to the current context of discussing movies and foods. MEMORY 4 about Speaker B being a bartender is also irrelevant. Overall, the memory lacks clear connection and relevancy to the dialogue and does not contribute much to generating helpful responses in the context of the conversation provided."
