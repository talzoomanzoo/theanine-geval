Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes.  Speaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me. Speaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house.  Speaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n2. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n3. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n4. Bandicoot was a rescue and has been at the Raccoon Cafe since he was a baby.\n5. Speaker A is interested in animals, specifically raccoons and bearded dragons.\n6. Speaker B owns a raccoon named Bandicoot and a bearded dragon named Bob.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't contacted animal control yet, but that's a good suggestion. It's great to hear that Bandicoot found a loving home with you. Working at the raccoon cafe sounds like a unique and fulfilling experience.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly the information about Speaker B's experience with raccoons and the mention of Bandicoot as a rescue. However, there is room for improvement in how the MEMORY is structured and connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\nThe key points related to the MEMORY align with the conversation about raccoons, such as:\n- Speaker B's belief in caring for raccoons and having a raccoon as a pet (Memory 1).\n- The mention of Bandicoot being a rescue (Memory 4), which somewhat relates to Speaker B's experience described in the dialogues about animal control and the raccoon cafe.\n\nHowever, some details feel slightly redundant or not directly connected to the context, such as Speaker A's interest in animals (Memory 5), as this was not explicitly discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\nOverall, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful, but it could benefit from clearer connections and emphasis on the most relevant past interactions concerning raccoons to better inform the generation of a next response."
