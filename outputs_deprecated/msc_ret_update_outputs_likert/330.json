Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment.  Speaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon? Speaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think? Speaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus! Speaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing? Speaker A: Yea, I think for the more complicated origami it's kind of a use it or lose it but for the simple stuff you can usually take a couple months of and still remember to do it! Did you see origami in Japan?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n2. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n3. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n4. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n5. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n6. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I did see origami in Japan! It was incredible to witness the intricate designs and the skill involved in creating them. I can't wait to learn more about it from you and maybe even try making some adorable origami animals together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several points that align well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and can aid the language model in generating a response. Some of the relevant information includes Speaker A having learned origami by themselves (Memory 1) and offering to teach Speaker B (Memory 3), which echoes the conversation in the context about origami skills and the potential teaching opportunity. Furthermore, it provides clarity on Speaker A's interest and achievement in origami (Memory 2 and 6), which adds depth to their character in the conversation. Memory 5 and the latter part of Memory 6 introduces new information about Speaker B's interests and Speaker A's specific origami projects that, while helpful contextually to some extent, are not directly linked to the immediate dialogue. Overall, the memories are well-structured and relevant, providing useful insight into the speakersâ€™ interactions, with only a slight disconnect in relevancy in Memory 4."
