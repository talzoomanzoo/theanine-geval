Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok?  Speaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish? Speaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus! Speaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well? Speaker A: Yes, I am thinking about trying either the new eclairs, or their tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle! I have too many good options to pick from! What one would you pick?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n2. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n3. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n4. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n5. Speaker A's restaurant plays a mix of songs, mainly easy listening, to create a relaxing environment for diners.\n6. Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Both options sound delicious, but I think I would go for the tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle. It sounds like the perfect combination of sweet and tangy flavors. Enjoy your meal!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for Speaker B to generate a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives background about Speaker A's work environment at the restaurant and their experiences there, which is highly relevant to the context of discussing food at the restaurant. Particularly useful information includes Speaker A getting free meals (point 1), which aligns with the excitement over trying new dishes for free, and the fact that Speaker A finds the restaurant busy but enjoyable (point 3), which could add context to any further discussion about work-life balance or enthusiasm for new menu items. Point 2 about Speaker A inviting Speaker B to visit could be potentially helpful if the conversation shifts towards planning a visit. Though points 4, 5, and 6 are not directly relevant to the current dialogue about food dishes and dessert choices, they are naturally phrased and can be easily identified as less relevant at the moment. Overall, the MEMORY offers a coherent and relevant portrayal of past interactions and conditions that align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
