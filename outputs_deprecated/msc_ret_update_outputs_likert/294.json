Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice.  Speaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with? Speaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think? Speaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point. Speaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.   Speaker B: I didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something? Speaker A: The rice needs to be cool before adding to the pan.  Are you able to take a passenger along in you truck? Speaker B: Oh! That makes since. I didn't realize that the temperature made a difference when frying rice. As for the truck, Yes I can. But, depending on what company I'm working for at the time, they often set restrictions on passengers. Speaker A: The rice tends to stick together if it's warm.  I would like to ride along with you sometime when you're able. Speaker B: I actually have a scheduled haul for next Wednesday. Do you want to come along for that ride? It should take about five hours. Speaker A: Sure, I'm free that day.  What time do I need to meet you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n2. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n3. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n4. Speaker A is interested in running a business with their cooking skills.\n5. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n6. Speaker B lives in a rural area with a farm and can relate to cooking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful context for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning, which is relevant given the conversation about beginner recipes and cooking techniques. The detail that Speaker B's husband enjoys Asian food is directly related to the suggestion of shrimp fried rice. The MEMORY also portrays Speaker A as knowledgeable about cooking, justifying their recommendation of the pressure cooker and fried rice recipe. While not every detail directly links to the conversation, the memories are naturally phrased and allow for easy identification of the relevant background information, such as the rural setting and interest in cooking with a pressure cooker. However, the mention of a business interest in cooking or specific dishes like dahl and tandoori chicken is not directly relevant to the current dialogue, preventing a perfect score."
