Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?   Speaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere! Speaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n2. Speaker B is interested in volunteering and prefers cats over dogs, especially kittens.\n3. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters.\n4. Speaker A enjoys grilling indoors and suggests grilled asparagus with lemon on it.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B are excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines.\n6. Speaker A dreams of meeting all the puppies from history when they can move through space and time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I actually love grilling asparagus! One of my favorite ways to prepare it is by grilling it indoors and then squeezing some fresh lemon juice on top. It gives it a nice citrusy kick that really enhances the flavor. Would you like me to share the recipe with you?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, sentence 1 helps to clarify the nature of Speaker A's involvement with animals, which enriches the conversation about puppies and kittens. Sentence 4 directly relates to the second half of the conversation where Speaker B asks for asparagus recipes, making it highly relevant and helpful. Furthermore, sentence 3 reinforces the idea that Speaker A is involved in both cooking and animal care, which are salient to the topics being discussed. Sentences 5 and 6 are less directly related to the current dialogue but are well-phrased and illustrate clear past interactions or shared interests between the speakers. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured and provides relevant information that can aid in generating a contextually appropriate response."
