Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position.  Speaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it? Speaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days.  Speaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living. Speaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime? Speaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play. Speaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with. Speaker A: Sounds great! Now the tough question: when do you have time? Speaker B: It would have to be sometime when I'm off work, maybe on the weekend.  Speaker A: OK. Just let me know when you want to plan it and I will put in the reservation request. Do you need to borrow cleats or anything? I am a size 11.5.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n3. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n4. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n5. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n6. Speaker A is seeking career advice from a guidance counselor and is open to suggestions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's generous of you, thanks! I think I have an old pair lying around somewhere, but I might take you up on that offer if I can't find them. I'll check my schedule and get back to you about a good weekend to hit the field.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides mostly helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The details about Speaker B playing intramural soccer in college directly relate to the context where Speaker B mentions being a goalkeeper. Similarly, information about both speakers being soccer fans (Speaker B of Manchester United and Speaker A of Arsenal) offers additional background that can be useful for generating conversations related to soccer, which is a central theme in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the last point about Speaker A seeking career advice from a guidance counselor is not directly relevant to the ongoing soccer-related conversation and could be less immediately useful. Despite that, the MEMORY overall is naturally phrased, and the connections to soccer help in understanding the shared interest of both speakers, aiding in generating appropriate responses."
