Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\n2. Speaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally.\n3. Speaker A plays the drums and loves making food for others.\n4. Speaker A enjoys cooking and finds it helpful for stress relief.\n5. Speaker A cooked steak, fried potatoes, and shrimp for dinner with their father.\n6. Speaker B's hobbies include snowboarding, listening to music, singing, spending time with family, and cooking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I can definitely make the garlic chicken for you! Besides that, I've taught myself how to make spicy Thai curry, jalapeno poppers, and buffalo chicken wings. I love experimenting with different levels of heat in my dishes. What about you, any favorite spicy recipes you enjoy making?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided is quite helpful as it offers relevant insights into Speaker B's cooking interests and skills, which directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where cooking is discussed. Specifically:\n\n1. Sentence 1 is directly relevant as it highlights Speaker B's enjoyment of cooking for loved ones and their appreciation of a specific dish (garlic chicken) that Speaker A mentioned, which indicates Speaker B's likelihood of being able to make the dish.\n2. Sentence 6 supports this context by mentioning cooking as one of Speaker B's hobbies, further reinforcing their interest and possible proficiency in making dishes like garlic chicken.\n\nOther sentences, like 2, 3, 4, and 5, while they are about Speaker A and less directly relevant, are phrased clearly enough for the language model to identify them as additional information about Speaker A's cooking hobby and personality in general. \n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides a good amount of helpful information that is relevant to the dialogue context concerning cooking and specific interests of Speaker B."
