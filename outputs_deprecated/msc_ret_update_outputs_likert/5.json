Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there? Speaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay? Speaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately? Speaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"' Speaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n2. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n3. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n4. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n5. Speaker A, a retired librarian, recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit.\n6. Both Speaker A's mother and Speaker A were librarians, but Speaker A is retired.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "\"The Gettysburg Campaign\" is a fascinating account of one of the most critical moments in the Civil War. It delves into the strategies and battles that shaped the outcome of the war. If you're not into history, I would recommend a different genre for you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, especially with the trip and book-related themes. For instance, MEMORY 1 provides context for Speaker B's adventurous trip to Costa Rica, which aligns with the current conversation about Costa Rica. MEMORY 5 and 6 also touch on Speaker A's background as a retired librarian, which could potentially relate to their interest in historical books. However, much of the MEMORY content such as Speaker B not having started packing (MEMORY 2) or being excited about Easter weekend and spring break (MEMORY 3), and the interaction about the recommended book's genre (MEMORY 4) doesn't directly connect with the immediate flow of the dialogue. Overall, while some sentences are relevant and could be useful, others are either not directly related or do not add significant depth to the current interaction, thus leading to a moderate score."
