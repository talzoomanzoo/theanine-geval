Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast. Speaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project. Speaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on? Speaker B: I'm sure the student appreciate that. You teach as a group as apposed to one-on-one right? And one of the companies I work for had their system hit with a virus so I've been upgraded their software to debug the system. Speaker A: I teach group classes and one on one, but I was the student today. I specialize in jiu-jitsu but today I got to be the student in a taekwondo class.  Speaker B: That's even better, learning is a life-long journey. How are you class on martial art history? When you have time teach me too, I'd love to learn. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it.\n2. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\n3. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things.\n4. Speaker A is a martial arts teacher and student and is pursuing an athletic training degree in college.\n5. Speaker A is a college student who teaches jiu-jitsu and is lactose intolerant.\n6. Speaker B is busy debugging software and is a runner.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I couldn't agree more, learning never stops. My class on martial art history is going well, and I'd be happy to share some interesting insights with you. It's fascinating to explore the roots of different martial arts and how they've evolved over time. I'll make sure to incorporate some cool facts next time we chat.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that helps contextualize the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Memories 1, 2, and 3 are helpful as they establish that both speakers share an interest in martial arts, which aligns with the current dialogue about martial arts classes. Memories 4 and 5 highlight Speaker A's role as both a martial arts teacher and student, which correlates directly with the context of teaching and attending classes in the dialogue. Memory 2 also connects Speaker B's work in software with their personal interests, though it introduces an online class about martial arts not mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Memory 6 adds slight context about Speaker B's occupation, which is relevant but not directly aligned with the immediate dialogue. Overall, the memories are well-structured, provide contextual background, and relate well to the context, adding helpfulness to generating appropriate responses. However, minor elements such as lactose intolerance and running are not relevant to the current dialogue, accounting for a score slightly less than perfect."
