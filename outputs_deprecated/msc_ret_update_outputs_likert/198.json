Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position.  Speaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n3. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n4. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n5. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n6. Speaker B started looking for jobs towards the end of college to secure a job for after graduation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I do miss it sometimes, especially the rush of making a crucial save. But I still enjoy watching games and cheering for my favorite teams. Speaking of which, how's your training going for the upcoming match?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a substantial amount of helpful information for the language model, with most of it being relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 3 and 6 directly pertain to Speaker B's past soccer experience, which aligns with the topic of playing soccer in college, thereby giving context to Speaker B's role and interests. Sentence 3 offers relevant background information on Speaker B's soccer experience, connecting to the conversation about being a goalkeeper. Sentence 6 adds depth by mentioning Speaker B's transition phase after college, demonstrating development in their life beyond soccer.\n\nAlthough sentences 1, 2, 4, and 5 focus more on Speaker A, they still help establish the shared interest in soccer, which is a central theme of the dialogue. These sentences are naturally structured and can be easily identified as either relevant or not immediately related to generating a response in the context. The language model can use this memory to understand speakers' soccer-related interests and history, even if not all memory sentences directly contribute to the immediate dialogue context.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY has naturally connected sentences that provide useful background for understanding the speakers' interactions, especially regarding their soccer experiences and interests, which aids in generating a coherent and contextually appropriate response."
