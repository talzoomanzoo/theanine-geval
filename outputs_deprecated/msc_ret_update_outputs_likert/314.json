Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you. Speaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them Speaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued.  Speaker B: Well if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get  Speaker A: Wow! Ok! This is sounding like a bigger undertaking! Should I embrace bugs in the home if they help the plants or am I getting wild? Speaker B: Well from my experince bugs do the complete opposite and don't help at all, so avoid that at all costs! Fertilizers are the way to go to help with growth. Speaker A: Oh man. I have lots to learn. What is the lifespan of a plum tree? Speaker B: around 10 to 15 years but if you take care of them I'm sure you could get 20 out of it. Speaker A: Now we are also talking commitment! This is not how I expected my day to go! I am excited, yet so nervous! \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n4. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n5. Speaker B is also interested in space exploration and plant science, expressing concerns about the fuels used for space travel.\n6. Speaker B jokes about sending space weeds into space and enjoys the idea of it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Don't worry, gardening is a rewarding journey! Just take it one step at a time, and soon you'll be enjoying the beauty of your own little green oasis at home. And who knows, maybe one day we'll have space gardens to tend to as well!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some relevant information that helps in understanding the dynamics between Speaker A and Speaker B, specifically in the context of gardening and Speaker B's knowledge about it. Sentence 1 identifies Speaker A's lack of experience with gardening, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A expresses surprise and excitement about indoor gardening with trees. Sentence 2 establishes Speaker B's expertise in gardening, supporting their role in providing advice in the dialogue. However, the rest of the MEMORY involves topics that are unrelated to the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT (e.g., space plants, space travel, weight issues), which doesn't directly aid in generating the next response based on the current direction of the conversation. While not entirely out of place, these sentences do not contribute significantly to the interaction about indoor gardening. The MEMORY could have been more helpful if it had more direct connections to the topics of discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
