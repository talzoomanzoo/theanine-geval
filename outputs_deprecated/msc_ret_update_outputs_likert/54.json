Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. Speaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?   Speaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone. Speaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you? Speaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know. Speaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient!  Speaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends? Speaker B: No not at all but if you didn't feel comfortable talking to me I can recommend a couple of my colleagues who are just as brilliant Speaker A: I'd prefer to see you since I'm already comfortable talking to you! It will get the awkward part out of the way for me!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n2. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n3. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n4. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n5. Speaker B is a professional in a practice, where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients.\n6. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B could pay a fee to a ranch to take care of a horse.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I completely understand. If you feel comfortable talking to me, then I'm more than happy to help. It's important to feel at ease when discussing personal matters, so if that's with me, then I'm here for you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains several relevant pieces of information that can aid Speaker B in generating a response related to the therapy discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, point 4 clarifies Speaker B's experience in their own practice, which can enhance their credibility when offering therapy to Speaker A. Additionally, point 5 is pertinent as it touches upon the legal and ethical implications of the therapist-client relationship, which could influence the discourse about being comfortable with Speaker B as a therapist. Points 1 and 6, while not directly related to the current conversation, are naturally structured and easy for the model to identify as extraneous to the primary dialogue. However, points 2 and 3 discuss Speaker A and B's knowledge about horses and psychology and are less relevant to the primary focus around therapy in the conversation. Overall, while the memory contains useful information, several elements are not crucially connected to the dialogue's flow about therapy, leading to a moderate score."
