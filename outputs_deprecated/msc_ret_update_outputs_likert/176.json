Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n4. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.\n5. Speaker A frequents live band venues and plays music at home.\n6. Speaker B is not going out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's really thoughtful of you to offer the cabin! I'll talk to my wife and see if that could work for us. It would definitely make things more comfortable for her during the festival. Thank you for the suggestion.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several pieces of information that are directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 3 are particularly helpful because they give context to the conversation about attending a festival, which is the main focus of the current discussion. Sentence 1 specifically states that Speaker B's wife is pregnant, which ties directly into the offer of a more comfortable accommodation option. Sentence 2 establishes a shared interest in Bluegrass music, which is indirectly connected but still relevant. Sentence 4, although not directly tied to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, helps to inform the dynamic between Speaker A and Speaker B and provides context to B's feelings, which can influence conversational tone or content. Sentences 5 and 6, while providing background on the speakers' lifestyles, are less relevant to the immediate conversation but still useful in understanding overall dynamics. The MEMORY is structured in a way that connects the thoughts and gives a coherent picture of the interaction history, hence a score close to the top mark is justified."
