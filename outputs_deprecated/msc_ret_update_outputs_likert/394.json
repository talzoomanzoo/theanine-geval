    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes.  Speaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me. Speaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house.  Speaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it.  Speaker A: That is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n2. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n3. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n4. Bandicoot was a rescue and has been at the Raccoon Cafe since he was a baby.\n5. Speaker A hears raccoons and cats fighting in their neighborhood.\n6. Speaker B mentioned that raccoons cannot legally be sold as pets, but can be rescued and cared for before being released back into the wild.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, Bandicoot has been a quick learner! I've been teaching him some basic tricks like rolling over and standing on his hind legs. It's amazing how intelligent and curious raccoons can be. If you ever decide to befriend them instead of keeping them away, you might be surprised at how entertaining and charming they can be.",
    "prediction": "**Helpfulness Score: 4**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains several pieces of information that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and can assist Speaker B in generating a proper next response:\n\n1. Statement 1 mentions that Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it, which ties directly into Speaker A's question about teaching raccoons tricks.\n   \n2. Statement 2 discusses Speaker B's belief that raccoons can be good pets if properly cared for, which aligns with Speaker A's concern over having raccoons near their house and whether it's feasible to befriend them.\n\n3. Statement 3 notes that Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes, which closely matches the beginning of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\n4. Statement 4 adds background on Bandicoot being a rescue, explaining its presence at the Raccoon Cafe, which aligns with previous dialogue about how Speaker B acquired Bandicoot.\n   \n5. Statement 5 about raccoons and cats fighting introduces another aspect of raccoon behavior that Speaker A might find relevant, although it isn't directly part of the current dialogue; it could be used as additional context or talking points.\n   \n6. Statement 6 discusses legal aspects of raccoon handling, providing a useful contextual layer even if it's not directly relevant to the immediate conversation.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY mostly provides contextually relevant information that connects well with the current dialogue, aiding in the development of an appropriate response. However, some background points, although relevant, are less directly linked to the specific conversation at hand, which is why it doesn't achieve a perfect score."
