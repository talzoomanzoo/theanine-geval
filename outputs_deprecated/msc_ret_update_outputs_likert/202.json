Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position.  Speaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it? Speaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days.  Speaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living. Speaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime? Speaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n3. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n4. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n5. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n6. Speaker A is seeking career advice from a guidance counselor and is open to suggestions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! It'll be a fun way to stay active and bond over our love for soccer. Let me know when you organize it, I'll definitely be up for some friendly matches.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information about Speaker A's and Speaker B's backgrounds and interests related to soccer, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Memories from sentences 1 and 2 help highlight Speaker A's active participation in soccer, enhancing the dialogue about being a soccer video game commentator. Sentence 3 connects with Speaker B's history in soccer and current fandom, aligning with his suggestion to get back into playing. Other facts, like Speaker A's performance (sentence 4) and interest in soccer (sentence 5), support the idea of arranging a friendly game among friends in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Although not directly related, sentence 6 is naturally phrased and does not disrupt understanding but provides a broad perspective on Speaker A's character development. Overall, the MEMORY contains relevant and naturally structured information that aids in generating a coherent response in the dialogue context."
