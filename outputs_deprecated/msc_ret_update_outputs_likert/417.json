Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin! Speaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name?  Speaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls!  Speaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well? Speaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens. Speaker B: hehe you're right. But i can't explain that why I am not a cat person to you sorry. How's the weather like today, still good weather to have iced tea out there?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n2. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n3. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n4. Speaker A is from a city known for great iced teas and prefers unsweetened iced tea.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted and humorous conversation about their pets and travels.\n6. Speaker A enjoys drinking tea and water.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "The weather is perfect for some unsweetened iced tea today! It's so refreshing. And don't worry about not being a cat person, everyone has their preferences. Maybe one day Pumpkin will win you over with those cute orange furballs!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several useful pieces of information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 3 connect directly with the discussion about the kitten's name and Speaker B's relationship with cats, showing past interactions and opinions. Sentence 4 ties into the current conversation about the weather and drinking iced tea, enhancing the context for Speaker B's question regarding the weather and iced tea. Sentence 5 reflects the tone of their interactions, which is helpful for maintaining the appropriate conversational style. Sentence 2, although relevant to the subject of pets, is not immediately helpful in generating the next response, as it does not add new insight to the ongoing conversation. Sentence 6 offers additional context but is more general in scope. Overall, the MEMORY provides a well-rounded context with a clear relevancy to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, warranting a high score, but some details could be better aligned with the immediate context of the dialogue."
