    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer? Speaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to? Speaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors? Speaker B: Yes. That way they could have a fireworks show too. I love fireworks. Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle? Speaker A: No, but I have been to Disney World in Florida.  I love fireworks too.  I want to get married on the 4th of July.  That was we will have a national holiday and fireworks for us every year!  It sounds like you've been to Disneyland? Speaker B: No, but I thought you might have since you lived in LA for awhile. Did you get to see any live Disney music performances while you were at Disney World? Speaker A: No, we rode a lot of rides that broke down.  We had to be rescued from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.  It was stuck.  Someone put on waders and pushed us to the side to climb out. Speaker B: Oh no! Hopefully your trip to the art museum is much better than that. Did your boyfriend go to Disney World too? Speaker A: No, I had a cousin that I went with.  We stayed in a hotel in Miami too and I got so sunburned on the beach!  I'm sure the art museum will be good if it isn't too crowded.  Was your concert crowded? Speaker B: It was so crowded, but my older brothers went with me and kept me from getting squished. Make sure you wear sunscreen when you visit the beach this time! Speaker A: Yes, I know to put on SPF 75 this time!  So what is the art museum in Sao Paulo like?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is planning to visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend.\n2. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo.\n3. Speaker B recommends visiting the Museum of Art of São Paulo in the city.\n4. Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods.\n5. Speaker B mentions that there are all kinds of beaches in São Paulo, including busy, calm, and trendy ones.\n6. Speaker A loves Disney music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "The Museum of Art of São Paulo in São Paulo is a spectacular place. It's renowned for its diverse galleries, including impressive sculpture gardens. You'll be amazed by the art collection, especially if you enjoy impressionist paintings like Van Gogh. It's definitely a must-visit while you're in the city!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that could assist in generating a coherent response. Sentences like \"Speaker A is planning to visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend,\" and \"Speaker B recommends visiting the Museum of Art of São Paulo in the city,\" connect with the dialogue context where Speaker A shows interest in museums. The memory also mentions their interest in music concerts and in São Paulo, which aligns with parts of the context, as they also talk about concerts and fireworks. However, the MEMORY could be more helpful if it included details about past conversations or interactions specifically related to Disney or Speaker A's trips since these topics are highlighted in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Some other items in the memory, such as \"Speaker A loves Disney music,\" do not directly connect with the context of the last conversation, but they are still related. This MEMORY would benefit from a greater focus on the current dialogue topics for higher helpfulness."
