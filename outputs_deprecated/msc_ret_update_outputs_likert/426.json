Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha! Speaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes? Speaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n3. Speaker B prefers animals to humans but acknowledges the importance of curing diseases.\n4. Speaker A's interest in neuroscience was further fueled by their experience in a research lab and being in the Eagle Scouts.\n5. Speaker A is interested in scuba diving and neuroscience, with experience in a research lab.\n6. Speaker A is scared of sharks but finds the idea of going into a steel cage with them interesting.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fascinating! It's amazing how diverse the animal kingdom is and how much we can learn from observing different species. Have you ever thought about incorporating your love for reptiles into your scientific interests?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3 \n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context for generating Speaker A's next response. The mention of Speaker B having two snakes named Hansel and Gretel is directly relevant to the dialogue, as it confirms Speaker B's affinity for reptiles discussed in the context. However, the MEMORY mostly focuses on Speaker A's interests outside of reptiles, such as neuroscience, scuba diving, and fear of sharks. While this additional information about Speaker A can guide the conversation if it shifts topics, it is less directly helpful in constructing a response strictly about Speaker B's appreciation of reptiles, which is the current topic of the dialogue. Some connections between Speaker B's love for reptiles and Speaker A's scientific interests (in neuroscience) can be inferred but are not explicitly clear. The MEMORY includes information that isn't detrimental but is phrased and structured in a way that makes it clear which parts are directly relevant and which are not."
