Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make? Speaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it. Speaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too? Speaker B: Yeah definitely! I know you like hot foods, so if you learn and can make them fresh it will taste amazing. Have you tried any new foods lately? Speaker A: Not any new foods, but I did try a new food truck near me that was delicious! It was street tacos and you could pick from barbacoa, chicken, and steak for the protein. Do you like Mexican food?  Speaker B: Oh god I do love Mexican food. That was be so hard to pick because they're all so good! Did they have al pastor by any chance? I loved marinated pork tacos.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\n2. Speaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally.\n3. Speaker A plays the drums and loves making food for others.\n4. Speaker A enjoys cooking and finds it helpful for stress relief.\n5. Speaker A cooked steak, fried potatoes, and shrimp for dinner with their father.\n6. Speaker B's hobbies include snowboarding, listening to music, singing, spending time with family, and cooking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, they did have al pastor! The marinated pork was so flavorful and juicy, it was definitely one of the highlights. I'll have to bring you some next time I visit, along with some of my latest cooking experiments. What's your favorite Mexican dish to cook at home?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it contains details about Speaker B's enjoyment of cooking and a specific family recipe (garlic chicken), which is particularly relevant since garlic chicken was mentioned in the dialogue as a dish Speaker A expressed interest in. Additionally, Speaker A's interest in cooking and following recipes, as noted in the MEMORY, aligns with their expressed desire to learn how to make spicy foods and their enjoyment of cooking as mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nHowever, not all MEMORY sentences are directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A playing the drums. Moreover, while the MEMORY captures some relevant interests and activities for both speakers, it could be more directly tied to specific past interactions or shared experiences between Speaker A and Speaker B to enhance the helpfulness for generating the next response. Thus, the MEMORY provides a moderate amount of helpful information, earning a score of 3."
