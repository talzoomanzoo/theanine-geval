Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys Greek mythology and did a case study on Poseidon, the God of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses.\n2. Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology.\n3. Speaker B has a child referred to as \"the little monster\" and is a parent.\n4. Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries.\n5. Speaker B's daughter is lucky to grow up close to the beach, only a fifteen-minute walk away.\n6. Speaker B appreciates the idea of superhuman powers and is interested in historical events that involve such figures.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, she's doing well, thank you for asking! I have started introducing her to Greek mythology through children's books and animated shows. She's quite fascinated by the stories of gods and goddesses.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that aids in generating a proper response in the dialogue context. The first memory point highlights Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology, which is directly connected to Speaker A's inquiry about sharing this interest with their daughter. The third and fifth points are also helpful because they establish that Speaker B is a parent and provides some context on their daughter's environment, which may influence her interest in Greek mythology. Additionally, Speaker B's interest in visiting Greece for its history and mythology (point 2) and their appreciation of superhuman powers (point 6) also complement the context by revealing how deeply they are engaged with this theme, potentially shaping their interactions with their daughter. The memory is structured naturally, allowing the language model to discern relationships and relevance effectively. However, not all sentences are directly beneficial to the dialogue context, which is why the rating is not a 5."
