    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden. Speaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n4. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n5. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n6. Speaker B's parents still live in Sweden, and they find it expensive to travel there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a substantial amount of helpful information that could aid in generating a proper next response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains relevant details such as that Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip together, which ties directly into Speaker A's statement about planning a trip to Sweden. Additionally, it includes Speaker A's consideration of visiting a cousin and needing to save money, which could influence their conversation. The MEMORY also mentions Speaker B's past visits to Sweden and fond memories, which might affect how Speaker B responds about the trip's progress. The included information about Speaker B's connection to Sweden through family also adds depth to the context, providing conversational nuances that can be explored in their dialogue. These details, although not strictly sequential, are interconnected and provide a sense of continuity in the conversations between Speaker A and B regarding their trip planning, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the absence of direct previous dialogues or a chronological sequence of interactions prevents it from scoring a full 5."
