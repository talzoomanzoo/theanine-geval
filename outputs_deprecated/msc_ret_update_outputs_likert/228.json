Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food? Speaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too? Speaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also? Speaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways? Speaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy? Speaker A: I think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals. Speaker B: Yea, that totally makes sense! I just wanted time off to spend with the dogs and look for a better job elsewhere, I'm hoping that I'll be able to get a job outside of a warehouse! Speaker A: That is understandable. I didn't always think I would end up a zookeeper. Do you have anything in mind? Speaker B: Well, I really enjoy animals so I might think of applying to work in a zoo aswell! Is it a super busy job? Speaker A: That sounds like a great idea! You would be surprised how busy it can be. Not every job is high demanding and you don't have to work with all the animals either. Is there anything you don't like to do?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a zoo and is willing to help Speaker B get an entry-level position there.\n2. Speaker A mentions that entry-level positions at the zoo involve cleaning enclosures and feeding less dangerous animals but offer decent pay, training, benefits, and assistance with schooling.\n3. Speaker B is looking for a new job and is excited about the opportunity at the zoo.\n4. Speaker A works as a zookeeper and loves animals, especially white tigers.\n5. Speaker A works at a zoo and has tried playing music for the white tigers and home concerts for their pets.\n6. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm not a big fan of cleaning but I'm willing to do it if it means working with animals. I'm really excited about the opportunity at the zoo!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a relevant background for generating a proper next response in the context of the dialogue. It captures important aspects such as Speaker A's job at the zoo, willingness to help Speaker B get a job there, and details about entry-level positions that were discussed. This makes it useful for furthering the conversation about job opportunities related to animals and Speaker B's interest in working at a zoo. However, some memories—like Speaker A's admiration for white tigers and the mention of concerts—are slightly less immediately relevant to the current dialogue without further context from Speaker A, though they are naturally connected and well-structured. Overall, the MEMORY provides mostly helpful cues directly following the trajectory of the conversation, earning it a score of 4."
