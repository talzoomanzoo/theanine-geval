Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates.\n2. Speaker A works for a small local business with a demanding schedule.\n3. Speaker A enjoys reading books about ice cream, Disney World, and computers.\n4. Speaker A is 27 years old and hopes to change careers soon.\n5. Speaker A is considering a career in dentistry but is also interested in working at Disney for happiness.\n6. Speaker A is torn between choosing a career in dentistry for the money or working at Disney for happiness.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant context for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it could be improved for better clarity and relevance. Specifically, item 2 mentions that Speaker A works for a small local business, which is somewhat related to the topic of jobs being discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Items 4, 5, and 6 provide background information on Speaker A's career aspirations, which could be relevant if the conversation shifts to career changes or aspirations. However, the MEMORY could be more helpful by connecting specific details about Speaker A's current job at the computer company, if applicable, since Speaker B is directly asking about this aspect. Overall, while the MEMORY contains some useful information, it does not clearly support the specific direction of the current conversation, thus earning a mid-level score."
