    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it! Speaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to? Speaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you? Speaker B: I have been relaxing with the kids as much as I have. My husband has been busy with work, so we haven't had time for anything big. I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before? Speaker A: I have never gone to Italy because I'm always so busy. If I ever go, I would want to spend a month there, but work has been hectic lately. Would your kids go with you if you went to Italy? Speaker B: Absolutely! I'd love to travel all over the world with my family to see everything. Hawaii sounds like just as much fun though. What are you most excited about doing when you get there? Speaker A: I'm extremely excited about the sunset tour. Each day is at a new location to watch the sunset. It's suppose to be romantic, but I am just going alone, so I see it as more calming than anything. Speaker B: I hope you have a lot fun. It sounds like a nice time to get away from everything. You should eat as much of the local Hawaiian food as you can. Have you had Hawaiian food before? I think it's great. Speaker A: No, I acctually haven't. I'm expecting pineapple and ham on everything, but I know they will having some amazing cultural food that is probably going to blow my mind! Is there a specific dish you would recommend Speaker B: I enjoy foods like Spam musubi, loco mocos, and poi. My favorite might be kalua pork. The way they prepare the pig makes it taste so good.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has seen the Disney movie 'Luca' recently.\n2.

    "raw_prediction": "Kalua pork sounds delicious! I'll definitely make sure to try it when I'm in Hawaii. I can't wait to experience the local cuisine and soak in the beautiful sunsets. It's going to be an unforgettable trip.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided is moderately helpful for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Here is a breakdown:\n\n1. Relevancy: Some parts of the MEMORY, such as Speaker A seeing the movie 'Luca' and booking a Hawaii sunset tour, are directly relevant to the dialogue context as they were discussed in the conversation. This helps maintain coherence in future responses.\n\n2. Additional Information: The MEMORY includes details that weren't explicitly mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A working two jobs and struggling to make time for themselves. This could offer additional insight into Speaker A's character and aid in generating responses that show empathy or understanding. However, the mention of 'first time' is inaccurate as it's not stated in the context and could mislead the language model.\n\n3. Miscellaneous Details: Some of the other points, like Speaker B's kids enjoying watching 'Luca' and Speaker B enjoying watching movies with her kids, align with the context but offer little new information that would meaningfully alter a response.\n\nThe MEMORY lacks clear development and context connections that would warrant a higher score, yet it contains some helpful points. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate."
