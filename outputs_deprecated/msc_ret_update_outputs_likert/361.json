    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week? Speaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you? Speaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions? Speaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like? Speaker A: I like all kinds of games. I like party, fighting, RPGs, shooters, action, adventure, and puzzle games. I enjoy playing Jurassic Park: World but I'd like to find another game to play. The storm means I'll be inside for a bit, so I think I'll curl up with some pizza and just zone out. Do you like to do anything else besides game when it's rainy?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n2. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n3. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n4. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n5. Speaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy playing video games in their free time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm the same way; I tend to gravitate towards games like RE even though they scare me! Besides gaming, I enjoy watching movies or reading a good book when it's rainy outside. It's the perfect excuse to relax and unwind. Maybe you can find a game that combines elements from different genres you enjoy to keep things interesting.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A and B's gaming preferences and earlier mentions of Resident Evil. For example, the MEMORY mentions Speaker A's hesitancy towards Resident Evil, which aligns with their preference for tamer games discussed in the context. It also notes both speakers enjoy video games in their free time, a general point consistent with the context. However, MEMORY could improve by providing more specific shared experiences or game preferences that directly build on the conversation, such as mentioning any suggestions provided by Speaker B that would fit the genres Speaker A enjoys. While some bits of MEMORY are useful for identifying the general mood and topic, not all sentences fully enhance the understanding of the ongoing dialogue in terms of the connection and development between speakers."
