Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? Speaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month Speaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation? Speaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there! Speaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo? Speaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people. Speaker A: That sounds awesome.  I haven't been to the zoo in so long.  I wish I could go. Speaker B: You should go with your sister! she can bring her dog. They probably have all kinds of exotic birds... Speaker A: That's a great idea!  I'm not sure how good her dog would do around other animals though.  She always barks like crazy whenever she sees any kind of animal. Speaker B: Oh, that's a good point. Maybe keep her away from the small rodent house and reptiles, eh?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys seeing pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister.\n2. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n3. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo.\n5. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n6. Speaker A has a sister who owns a corgi.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Definitely, we wouldn't want any chaos at the zoo with the dog barking up a storm. Maybe we can stick to the panda and penguin areas.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains relevant information but also includes some inaccuracies and irrelevant details that impact its overall helpfulness.\n\n1. Contrary to the MEMORY, Speaker A hasn't expressed enjoyment for seeing pandas; it was Speaker B who mentioned the zoo's pandas in San Diego.\n2. The mentions of Speaker B owning a cat and considering adopting a friend's kitten are somewhat relevant as they relate to the dialogue about owning a kitten.\n3. Some information lines are not directly reflected in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A enjoying seeing penguins, which is not mentioned at all in the context, and Speaker A's enjoyment of exotic birds, which is speculated by Speaker B in the dialogue but never confirmed by Speaker A.\n\nSome sentences like Speaker B's enjoyment of the zoo and their consideration to adopt a kitten are relevant and naturally connected to the conversation. However, there are inaccuracies and speculative or unfounded assertions that hinder the MEMORY's helpfulness in guiding future responses. The information about hobbies and interests is mostly irrelevant to this context, and there's confusion over details such as the species of dog owned by Speaker A's sister, which was initially identified as a corgi in the MEMORY.\n\nThe mix of relevant and irrelevant or inaccurate information gives this MEMORY a mid-range score of 3. The language model can identify snippets of useful information, but the presence of errors could lead to confusion when generating a next response based on this dialogue."
