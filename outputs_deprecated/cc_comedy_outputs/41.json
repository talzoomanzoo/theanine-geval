    "raw_prediction": "Co-workers B: I understand that you want to protect the bride, but kidnapping her is not the right way to go about it. We need to find a solution that doesn't involve taking drastic measures. Let's brainstorm together and come up with a plan that will ensure her safety without causing harm. Your intentions are good, Co-workers A, but we need to find a better way to handle this situation.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT discusses an unusual plan by Co-workers A to prevent a wedding, which is unrelated to any past events or characteristics shared in the MEMORY. The MEMORY talks about Co-workers B's supportive nature and previous events, none of which seem to give specific insight into the situation at hand in the conversation. The context doesn't require past information to respond appropriately.\n\nJudgement: No"
