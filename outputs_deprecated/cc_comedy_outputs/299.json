    "raw_prediction": "Neighbors B: I really appreciate you marking the boundary line, it shows how considerate you are. You know, seeing how dedicated you are with your routines and commitments, it really motivates me to stay on track with my own goals. Maybe we can check in with each other more often to keep each other accountable. Thank you for always being there for me as a neighbor.",
