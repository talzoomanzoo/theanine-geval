    "raw_prediction": "Response: \nClassmates B: I understand why you might feel uneasy about me knowing something so personal. Just know that my intentions are not to make you uncomfortable. I stumbled upon this information accidentally and it's nothing negative. Maybe it's a message for you to keep exploring new things and taking risks, just like we discussed before. Let's focus on the positive aspects and see where this new knowledge can take us.",

However, the MEMORY does not contain any specific past events or secrets that Classmates A is seeking information about, but rather general behaviors and discussions on positivity and exploring. \nJudgement: No"
