    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about Co-workers A's appreciation for a supportive boss. MEMORY provides information about the relationship and dynamics between Co-workers A and B, but it does not directly inform how Unknown should respond to Co-workers A's statement about feeling grateful, as it centers on support from a boss. The MEMORY does not contain specific information related to Co-workers A's boss or any relevant past events connected to this sentiment, making it irrelevant in generating a response.\n\nJudgement: No"
