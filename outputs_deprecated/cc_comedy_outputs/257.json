    "raw_prediction": "Co-workers A: Yeah, I remember that time we uncovered that mystery at the clothing store. It was so exciting using our detective skills to solve the case.\n\nCo-workers B: Definitely! It was like something out of a detective movie. You've always had a knack for uncovering secrets.\n\nCo-workers A: Thanks, it's just a fun hobby of mine. Hey, speaking of mysteries, have you heard anything about Ms. Singh lately?\n\nCo-workers B: Not really. I think she moved to another state, but I'm not sure where. It's a shame she left, she was such a great teacher.\n\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I miss her. Remember how she used to always bring us donuts on Fridays? Good times.\n\nCo-workers B: Absolutely. Those were the days. Hey, let's celebrate our detective work with drinks after work tonight. It'll be like old times at the clothing store.\n\nCo-workers A: Sounds like a plan! I'll meet you there. Thanks for always being my partner in crime, both at work and in solving mysteries.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves a personal experience (singing a solo at church) shared by Co-workers A, which is unrelated to any past events or information described in the MEMORY. The MEMORY focuses on work-related experiences, detective skills, and relationships with other co-workers, none of which seem relevant or necessary for generating a response to the current context of sharing a personal achievement at church. \n\nJudgement: \"No\""
