    "raw_prediction": "Co-workers B: Yeah, time really does fly. Remember when we used to work at the clothing store together? Those were some good times. And speaking of surprises, I still can't believe you uncovered that mystery with the employee hiding clothes to sell. You really have a knack for detective work. Let's celebrate tonight with some drinks after work!",

The memory contains details about Co-workers A's detective skills and their past work experiences, which do not pertain to the topic of singing at church. Therefore, this past information is not useful for generating a response relevant to the context provided.\nJudgement: No"
