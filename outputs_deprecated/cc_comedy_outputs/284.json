    "raw_prediction": "Student: Yeah, the hot sauce definitely gives my taste buds a workout! It's like a love-hate relationship, you know? I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's just too intense for me to handle. Just like how I enjoy trying new languages and planning fun activities with my grandkids for retirement - it's all about finding that balance between excitement and comfort.",

The MEMORY details several past actions and characteristics of the Student unrelated to this context of sensation or food discussion.\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
