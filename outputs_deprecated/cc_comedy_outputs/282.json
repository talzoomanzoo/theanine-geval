    "raw_prediction": "Student: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\n\nResponse: Well, it sounds like you're definitely not afraid of a little heat! Just like how you didn't hesitate to jump in and save that kid at the beach. Your bravery always shines through, even when faced with spicy challenges. Maybe next time, we can find a milder sauce for you to try!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on the immediate experience of consuming hot sauce, which does not seem to require any historical or past information about the Student for an appropriate or relevant response. It would likely be a conversation about the hot sauce experience or related to food, rather than the student's past actions or characteristics.\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
