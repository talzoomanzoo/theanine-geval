And thank you for the software recommendation, I'll definitely check out Microsoft Office. By the way, do you remember that time when you helped me with my homework and I really appreciated it? You've always been such a great friend, and I'm glad to have you in my life.",

The MEMORY contains information about the supportive relationship and past interactions between Classmates A and B, but it doesn't directly relate to the topic of the computer course or learning about computers. Therefore, the MEMORY isn't needed for generating a response to the current context.\n\nJudgement: N/A"
