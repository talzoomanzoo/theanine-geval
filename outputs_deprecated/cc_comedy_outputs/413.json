    "raw_prediction": "Response: That's awesome to hear! Your dedication and hard work really show in the product you've created. I remember when we talked about the importance of staying focused and determined. I'm sure your new workout equipment will attract plenty of interest from potential buyers. Have you thought about reaching out to fitness influencers or gyms to showcase your product? I'm here to support you every step of the way.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around Neighbors A expressing excitement about a potential buyer for their product, which does not inherently require past information. If Neighbors B's role is to be supportive or offer guidance, the MEMORY about their relationship could be relevant, but no specific past information is necessary for a language model to generate an appropriate supportive response.\n\nJudgement: N/A"
