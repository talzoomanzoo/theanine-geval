    "raw_prediction": "Co-workers A: Thank you for the kind words. I always try to handle conflicts with maturity and stand up for what's right.

Thus, past memory information such as advice and warnings, their supportive relationship, or past events is not needed for the lm to generate a proper next response.\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
