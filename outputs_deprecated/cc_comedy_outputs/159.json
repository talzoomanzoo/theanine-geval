    "raw_prediction": "Classmates B: Your dedication to your studies is truly admirable. I remember when you threw that belt in frustration, but look at how far you've come since then. It's inspiring to see how you've channeled that energy into something positive. And I agree, being a little weird and unique definitely adds some excitement to life. By the way, I'm glad you found the girl of your dreams at that party a couple of years ago. It seems like things are really falling into place for you.",
