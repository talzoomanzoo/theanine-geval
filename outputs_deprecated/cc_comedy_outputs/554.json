I've always admired your musical talent, and it would be cool to be able to play some tunes on my own.\n\nClassmates A: That's a great idea! I'd be more than happy to teach you some basics and jam together. It could be a fun way for you to start feeling more independent and explore your musical side.\n\nClassmates B: Thanks, that sounds like a great way to start. I appreciate your offer to help me out. Let's make some music together!",

It does not specifically require background information from the MEMORY about Classmates A's musical interests, new car purchase, or any shared events to generate an appropriate response. The question is general enough that a response can be crafted without any such past context.\nJudgement: N/A"
