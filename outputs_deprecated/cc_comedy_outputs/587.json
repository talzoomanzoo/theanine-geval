    "raw_prediction": "Response: Why don't we try brainstorming together again? I love hearing your ideas and helping you out with your writing. Remember, I'm here to support you and bounce ideas off of. Let's work through this together, just like we always do.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves the Husband expressing difficulty in finding new ideas for his writing. The MEMORY focuses mainly on Husband's personal characteristics, past experiences and his relationship with his wife, with no direct reference to his writing tasks or processes. Therefore, the MEMORY does not contain specific past information that would be helpful in generating a response for the current context of needing new ideas for writing.\nJudgement: No"
