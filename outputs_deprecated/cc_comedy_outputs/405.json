    "raw_prediction": "Classmates A: Hey, Classmates B, why is your face so red and splotchy? Did you get sunburned?\n\nClassmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed.\n\nClassmates A: Embarrassed? Why?\n\nClassmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier.\n\nClassmates A: Come on, tell me! I won't judge you, I promise.\n\nClassmates B: Well, I accidentally spilled my lunch all over myself in front of some people.\n\nClassmates A: (laughs) That's it? That's why you're embarrassed? I thought it was something serious.\n\nClassmates B: (sighs) Yeah, it's silly. But still embarrassing.\n\nClassmates A: Don't worry about it, Classmates B. We all have our embarrassing moments. Remember when you helped me redirect the ship's course to avoid that storm? You were so quick thinking and resilient. Your positive attitude always inspires me to do my best and avoid regrets.\n\nClassmates B: Thanks, Classmates A. Your dedication and patience in helping me prepare for the driving test meant a lot to me. We really do support and uplift each other, don't we?\n\nClassmates A: Absolutely. And remember that fossil you found? We should take it to a museum sometime. Our shared experiences and mutual support mean a lot to me. Let's keep lifting each other up.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is focused on Classmates B's physical appearance, specifically the redness and splotchiness of their face. MEMORY contains information about mutual support, admiration, and past events, but does not contain relevant past interactions or information regarding Classmates B's sunburn or similar experiences that could provide context for the redness. The MEMORY does not seem necessary for generating a response to the current inquiry about sunburn.\nJudgement: N/A"
