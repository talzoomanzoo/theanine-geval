    "raw_prediction": "Husband: You know, I've been thinking about what you said earlier. Maybe it's time for me to step out of my comfort zone and try writing in a different genre. I appreciate your support and encouragement, darling.\n\nWife: I'm glad to hear that, my love. You have so much talent and creativity, I know you'll come up with something amazing. Remember, I'm always here to help you bounce ideas around and support you every step of the way. You've got this!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT shows that the husband is struggling with his writing and looking for new ideas. The MEMORY does not contain any specific information related to his writing struggles or potential ideas that could help him. It primarily provides information about their relationship dynamics, past events, and encouragement from the wife. Although it mentions instances of reassurance and encouragement from his wife, it does not directly relate to finding new ideas for writing. Hence, the MEMORY does not contain helpful past information for generating a proper next response based on the current context.\n\nJudgement: No"
