    "raw_prediction": "I remember the first time we watched the sunrise together. It was such a peaceful and beautiful moment. I'm always here to listen to you, just like you've always been there for me. Let's make more memories like that, watching the sunrise and cherishing the small moments in life.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves the Parent discussing the importance of being a good listener. Although the MEMORY contains information about the Parent's and Child's life values, activities, and relationship dynamics, it does not specifically contain past information relevant to the concept of listening, which the Parent is emphasizing in the context. Thus, MEMORY does not contain helpful past information for generating a response based on the current context of discussing listening skills.\nJudgement: No"
