    "raw_prediction": "Wife: It sounds like you're really struggling with your writing, dear. Remember, just like how I reassured you after your fifth grade presentation, you have a unique voice that deserves to be heard. Maybe take a break, watch a movie together, and let your mind relax. Who knows, inspiration might strike when you least expect it. Just like how we found each other when we least expected it.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around the husband's struggle with writing and his search for new ideas. The MEMORY contains information about his relationships and past experiences, including being reassured by his wife. While the MEMORY indicates that the husband has been supported by his wife before, it does not provide specific past events or information relevant to overcoming his current writer's block. The context seems more focused on the husband's internal challenge rather than external support.\n\nJudgement: No"
