    "raw_prediction": "Response: That's great that you're focusing on studying algebra to improve your logical thinking skills! It reminds me of how competitive you are and how you always strive to be the best. Remember when you faced tough competition with that fast girl in middle school? It really pushed you to work harder and improve your skills. Your competitive nature definitely motivates you to challenge yourself and be the best you can be.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context is centered around Classmates A's focus on studying algebra. The memory provides background on Classmates A's competitive nature and previous experiences but does not directly relate to studying algebra or provide information that would help generate a specific response about this subject. It is more about their personality and past challenges rather than their current focus on algebra, so the memory is not particularly helpful for a response focused on algebra study.\nJudgement: No"
