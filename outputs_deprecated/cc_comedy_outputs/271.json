    "raw_prediction": "Wife: I love seeing how involved you are in the ministries at church. It's clear that your faith is a big part of who you are, and I admire that about you.\n\nHusband: Thank you, dear. My faith has always been a guiding light for me, and I'm grateful to have your support on this journey.\n\nWife: It's important to have a strong foundation to lean on, especially in times of need. I'm glad we share the same values and beliefs.\n\nHusband: Absolutely. Our faith has brought us closer together and helps us navigate life's challenges with grace and strength. I'm so thankful for that.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves the husband mentioning that he hung up some lights and candles today. The MEMORY contains information reflecting the husband's background, values, and relationships, but none directly relate to the topic of lights and candles. Thus, past information in MEMORY isn't particularly needed to generate a proper response.\nJudgement: N/A"
