    "raw_prediction": "Response: Mentee, your ability to empathize with others and see things from their perspective is truly commendable. Your compassionate heart and understanding nature are what make you such a special individual. It's clear that your experiences have shaped you into someone who values kindness and support for others. Remember, your resilience and determination to make a positive impact on people's lives is a testament to your strength and character. Keep being the compassionate and thoughtful person that you are, and continue to inspire others with your actions.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves the Mentee asking the Mentor about imagining thinking like someone else. The MEMORY provides background information about the Mentee's compassionate nature, their relationship with the Mentor, and past adversities faced together. Although this MEMORY contributes to understanding the depth of their relationship and the Mentee's thoughtful nature, it doesn't directly address the question about imagining thinking like someone else. The context does not require utilizing past information to generate a meaningful response.\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
