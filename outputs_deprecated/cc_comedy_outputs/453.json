Our friendship means a lot to me, and I value the trust and support we have for each other. Let's continue to be there for one another and see where our connection takes us.

Without knowing what Classmates A wants to talk about, it is impossible to assess the relevance of the MEMORY provided.\n\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
