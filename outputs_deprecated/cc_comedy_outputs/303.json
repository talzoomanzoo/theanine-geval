    "raw_prediction": "Neighbors A: It went pretty well, actually. Setting clear boundaries and expectations really helped my team understand what I needed from them. It's all about communication and being on the same page, just like with our boundary line. How's your workout routine going? I know you've been trying to stay motivated, but I'm here to support you in any way I can.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context is about marking a boundary line between properties. This scenario does not require past memory information about their supportive relationship, workout routines, shared interests, or cultural activities to respond appropriately. The context appears to be more about property boundaries and not about their personal relationship.\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
