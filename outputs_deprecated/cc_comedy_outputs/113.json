    "raw_prediction": "Classmates B: That's great to hear that you find carpentry so fulfilling! I remember how excited you were when you signed up for that seminar on starting a business. Have you made any progress on turning your entrepreneurial dreams into reality? And I'm still here cheering you on with your singing aspirations as well. Maybe we can collaborate on a song together in the future!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is focused solely on Classmates A expressing enjoyment in their current job as a carpenter. The MEMORY contents revolve around Classmates A's entrepreneurial aspirations and their passion for singing, both of which are not related to the current context of being a carpenter. Therefore, no past information in MEMORY is directly helpful for generating a response to the current context about carpentry.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
