    "raw_prediction": "Response: That's great to hear that you've been focusing on studying algebra! Your competitive nature definitely pushes you to excel in everything you do. Remember, it's important to find a balance and not always have to win. Just like when you found support from me during personal issues, it's okay to take a break and prioritize self-care. Keep up the hard work, but don't forget to take care of yourself too.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The given DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves Classmates A talking about focusing on studying algebra. The MEMORY provides background on Classmates A's competitive nature, personal challenges, and history of overcoming competition, but does not specifically relate to algebra or studying habits. There is nothing in the MEMORY that directly contributes to understanding or responding to the specific context of studying algebra.\nJudgement: No"
