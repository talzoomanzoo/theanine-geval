    "raw_prediction": "Mentee: Mentor, I've been thinking about personY a lot lately. I can't imagine what they must be going through. I want to help them, but I'm not sure how.\n\nMentor: It's wonderful that you're thinking about personY and wanting to help them. Sometimes just being there to listen and offer support can make a big difference. Have you tried talking to them and asking how you can help?\n\nMentee: I haven't yet, but I think I will. I want to be there for them like you've been there for me.\n\nMentor: That's a great idea. Remember to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, just like we've discussed before. I'm sure personY will appreciate your kindness and support.\n\nMentee: Thank you, Mentor. I'll keep that in mind. I'm grateful for your guidance and support.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT does engage a question of perspective-taking, which aligns with the MEMORY showing that the Mentor is empathetic and good at offering guidance. However, it doesn't specifically require past events or relationship context to respond to the question about imagining thinking like someone else. This scenario is more of a generic philosophical question rather than needing specific past interactions or contextual memory.\n\nJudgement: N/A"
