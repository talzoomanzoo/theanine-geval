    "raw_prediction": "Response: That's great to hear! It sounds like you're really putting in the effort to make positive changes. I believe in you and know you have a lot of potential to succeed.

The memory details Neighbors A's past behavior and relationship with Neighbors B, but it does not contain specific information related to selling a product or the buying market. Therefore, the MEMORY is not helpful for generating a response to this particular dialogue context.\nJudgement: No"
