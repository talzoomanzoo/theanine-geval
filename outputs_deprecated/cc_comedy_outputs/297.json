    "raw_prediction": "Response: Thanks for marking the boundary line, I appreciate the clarity. By the way, I saw a new workout routine online that I think you might like, I can share it with you if you're interested. Also, I remember how much you enjoyed \"The Great Gatsby\" - have you found any other good books to read lately? And maybe we can plan another cultural event to attend together soon.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:  \nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about marking property boundaries, which does not appear to relate to any of the past events or relationship dynamics described in MEMORY. The MEMORY provides information about their shared activities and supportive relationship, but none of this information is necessary for addressing property boundaries.  \nJudgement: \"N/A\""
