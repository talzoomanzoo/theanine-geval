    "raw_prediction": "Classmates B: It sounds like you've learned a lot from your computer course, especially about using different programs efficiently. I'm glad to see you're expanding your skills and knowledge in that area.\n\nClassmates A: Thanks! Yeah, it was really interesting to learn about all the different software options and how to choose the right one for each task. It's been a valuable experience for sure.\n\nClassmates B: I'm proud of you for taking on this course and putting in the effort to learn. It's great to see you growing and developing new skills. Keep up the good work!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on Classmates A completing a computer course. The MEMORY primarily contains details about Classmates A's past experiences with dance, relationships, maturity, and support from friends during tough times. None of this past information seems directly relevant to the specific topic of computer courses or learning about computers. Therefore, it is unlikely that the MEMORY would be helpful in generating a response to the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\nJudgement: \"No\""
