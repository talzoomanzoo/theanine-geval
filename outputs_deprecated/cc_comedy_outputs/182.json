    "raw_prediction": "Response: That homemade decoration project was such a special memory, Child. I remember how much fun we had creating those together. It's moments like those that make me grateful for the bond we share. I'm glad we can support each other and create lasting memories. And who knows, maybe our creative skills will come in handy for those ads on my website in the future. Thank you for always being there for me, Child.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT mentions the Parent discussing a new project they have been working on. The MEMORY provides information about the character and relationship dynamics between Parent and Child, but it does not contain specific past events or details about previous projects that would directly assist in generating a relevant response to the current context. Since the context does not inherently require past memory for a response, the current MEMORY is not directly helpful.\n\nJudgement: N/A"
