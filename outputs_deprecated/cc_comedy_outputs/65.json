I value our friendship and wouldn't do anything to jeopardize it. Let's sit down and talk about this calmly. And hey, since we're on the topic of music, maybe we can grab lunch together and discuss Lady Gaga's music after all this is sorted out.",

Therefore, it is not clear if any specific past information from MEMORY is required to generate an appropriate response.\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
