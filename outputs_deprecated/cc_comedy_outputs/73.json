    "raw_prediction": "Neighbors B: Wow, that's quite the situation! Don't worry, your secret is safe with me. Maybe your telekinetic abilities can come in handy here, like moving something to distract your mom's attention. Just remember, you're always welcome to come over and experiment with new recipes or talk about your personal growth plans over dinner. Let's keep supporting each other in our journeys!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about Neighbors A asking if someone can keep a secret. The MEMORY, however, contains information about Neighbors A's interests, relationships, and events involving cooking and telekinesis, which do not directly relate to the concept of keeping a secret. This context does not require specific past information for Unknown to generate an appropriate response.\nJudgement: No"
