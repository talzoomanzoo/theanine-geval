    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is simply a question asking if someone can keep a secret. It does not inherently require any past information to generate an appropriate response, as the context is too vague to determine what kind of secret might be involved.\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
