    "raw_prediction": "Wife: It's so heartwarming to see you so involved in the ministries at church. Your dedication and passion for your beliefs truly shine through in everything you do.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT contains a simple statement about the husband hanging lights and candles, which does not inherently require past information for a suitable response. The MEMORY primarily pertains to the wife's supportiveness and appreciation of the husband's activities and interests. Unless the dialogue were to develop around those topics, there seems no immediate need for past memory.\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
