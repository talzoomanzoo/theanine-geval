    "raw_prediction": "Co-workers A: Oh, I remember that day vividly. I was so frustrated with how things were going on set, and blowing up that rabbit was definitely a low point for me.\n\nCo-workers B: It's okay, we all have our moments. But I'm glad you were able to acknowledge it and learn from it. Remember when I suggested talking to the director about easing up on the schedule? It's important to communicate when things are getting overwhelming.\n\nCo-workers A: You were right. Your advice really helped me see things from a different perspective. And facing my fear of spiders was definitely a step in the right direction.\n\nCo-workers B: Exactly, it's all about growth and progress. I'm proud of how far you've come since then. And hey, maybe one day we can start our own production company together. Wouldn't that be amazing?\n\nCo-workers A: That would be a dream come true. I'm grateful to have you as a friend and a mentor. Let's keep pushing each other to do our best work.",
