    "raw_prediction": "Response: It's great to hear that you've been focusing on studying algebra! It's such an important subject to grasp. Remember what we talked about before, it's not just about the destination but also the journey. Keep up the good work and don't forget to take care of yourself while studying too.",

Therefore, the past information in MEMORY is not specifically relevant in this case.\nJudgement: N/A"
