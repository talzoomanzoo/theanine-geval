I didn't know you sang.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while.\nCo-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing?\nCo-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites.\nCo-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it.\nCo-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent.\n\nCo-workers B: You know, singing is a great way to express yourself. It's like finding hidden treasures within yourself, just like when we uncovered those hidden clothes being sold on the side. It takes courage to step out of your comfort zone, just like you did with the solo. I can relate to that feeling of discovery and achievement.\nCo-workers A: Thank you for understanding. It means a lot coming from you. Maybe we can treat ourselves to a nice dinner to celebrate both our accomplishments.\nCo-workers B: That sounds like a wonderful idea. I've been eyeing some new workout clothes too, maybe we can check them out after dinner. It's always good to reward ourselves for our hard work.",
