    "raw_prediction": "Co-worker A: Yeah, that was definitely a lesson learned the hard way. Thanks for always looking out for me, B. Your advice and support mean a lot to me.\n\nCo-worker B: Of course, A. I just want to see you succeed and be happy. You're a natural leader and I know you have what it takes to overcome any obstacle that comes your way. Just remember to stay focused and true to yourself.\n\nCo-worker A: Thanks, B. I'll keep that in mind. And next time I'll make sure to have a designated driver or use a ride-sharing service if I plan on going out. It's important to be responsible and reliable, just like you said.\n\nCo-worker B: That's the spirit, A. Always remember to prioritize your safety and well-being. I believe in you and know you'll continue to make great strides in both your personal and professional life.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about a trivial update regarding a trip to the post office, which does not require past conversation details or information about co-worker A's personality or their relationship with co-worker B for a reply. Thus, MEMORY does not contain helpful information for generating a response to this specific context.\n\nJudgement: N/A"
