    "raw_prediction": "Response: That's awesome! I love that you're using your platform to support under-the-radar artists. It's so important to promote talented individuals who may not always get the recognition they deserve. I'm not surprised you started this blog, considering how much you value independence and doing what makes you happy. It's great to see you thriving and following your passions!",

The memory focuses more on relationship dynamics and past gratitude which isn't directly applicable to the current topic of discussing a blog.\nJudgement: No"
