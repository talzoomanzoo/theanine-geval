    "raw_prediction": "Co-workers B: Your solo performance reminds me of the time we worked together at the clothing store, always solving mysteries and having each other's backs. Your detective skills definitely came in handy back then. I'm so proud of you for stepping out of your comfort zone and singing \"Amazing Grace\". Your bravery is truly inspiring. Let's celebrate your success with drinks tonight, just like old times. Cheers to our memories at the clothing store and to many more adventures ahead!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT mentions a recent solo performance by Co-workers A at church, which does not relate to the past information provided in the MEMORY. The MEMORY mainly contains information about Co-workers A's detective skills, shared work experiences, and Ms. Singh leaving, none of which are relevant to the solo performance at church. Therefore, the MEMORY does not contain helpful past information for generating a response about the current event.\n\nJudgement: No"
