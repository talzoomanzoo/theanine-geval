    "raw_prediction": "Classmates B: I understand your curiosity, but I can't reveal how I found out. Just remember to stay positive and be careful in your explorations. Maybe this mysterious woman has a message for you that will lead to making a positive change in the world. Just be cautious in your approach.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT indicates that Classmates A is inquiring about something specific from their past, but the MEMORY does not contain information that directly relates to Classmates A's past.

None of these details provide specific information about Classmates A's past that would help in generating a response to Classmates A's query.\n\nJudgement: No"
