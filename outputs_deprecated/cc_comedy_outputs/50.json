    "raw_prediction": "Co-workers B: Thank you for offering to help, I really appreciate it. I'm actually doing okay with my workload, but I'll definitely keep you in mind if I start feeling overwhelmed. And don't worry, I'll make sure to prioritize my health, especially after that fall I had. It's important to take care of ourselves, right? Thank you for being so supportive, it means a lot to me.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The current context is a simple inquiry about workload and doesn't necessarily require past information from the memory to generate a proper response. The memory details like health issues, past struggles, or a trade involving a horse are not directly related to the immediate question about workload.\n\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
