Plus, maybe you can compromise and go to the dinner for a little while and then come back home to relax.\nNeighbors B: That's a good idea, thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors A: No problem. Speaking of compromise, remember that dinner we went to a few days ago?\nNeighbors B: Yes, it was so much fun!\nNeighbors A: I'm glad you enjoyed it. Maybe we can make it a regular thing and try out new restaurants together.\nNeighbors B: That sounds great! And it gives me something to look forward to after work.\nNeighbors A: Speaking of work, how are you feeling about your job lately?\nNeighbors B: I've been thinking about it a lot, actually.
