    "raw_prediction": "Mentor: I'm originally from a small town in the Midwest. However, I've had the opportunity to travel to different countries and immerse myself in various cultures. It has been a truly enriching experience that has helped me gain a broader perspective on the world and the people in it. How about you, Mentee? Have you had the chance to explore different cultures through your work in helping others?",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves a philosophical question about imagining thinking like someone else, which does not necessarily require past specific memories or background information for a meaningful response. The context doesn't call for personal experiences or past events which are described in the memory section, thus making the past memories irrelevant to the next response.\n\nJudgement: N/A"
