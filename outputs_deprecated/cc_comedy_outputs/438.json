    "raw_prediction": "Mentor: Yes, I have tried to imagine what it's like to be in a different culture or country. It's important to learn about other cultures and broaden our perspectives. Understanding different cultural backgrounds can help us connect with others on a deeper level and foster mutual respect and understanding. It's a great way to expand our horizons and learn from diverse experiences.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves a query from the Mentee about imagining what it's like to think like someone else. The MEMORY describes the Mentor as an empathetic and supportive figure and outlines their relationship and past events. While these characteristics align with the Mentee's question, the memory doesn't contain specific past information that directly addresses the context of imagining thinking like someone else.\n\nJudgement: No"
