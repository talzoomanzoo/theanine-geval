    "raw_prediction": "Response: If you ever feel comfortable enough to share, I promise to keep your secret safe. I believe in the power of positivity and trust that you have good intentions behind whatever it is you're keeping to yourself. Remember, taking risks and exploring new things can lead to amazing opportunities, so don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone. Just stay aware of your surroundings and be cautious, like we talked about with the mysterious woman in the alley. Keep spreading positivity and making a difference in the world - it's what sets you apart.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves Classmates A asking Unknown about their past. The MEMORY, however, contains information about Classmates A's general personality and past events, rather than specific past information that Classmates A is referring to or that is likely anticipated in the current dialogue context. Therefore, MEMORY doesn't directly relate to the inquiry about Classmates A's past.\nJudgement: \"No\""
