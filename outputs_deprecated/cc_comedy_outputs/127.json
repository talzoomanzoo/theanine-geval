    "raw_prediction": "Co-workers B: I appreciate your dedication to making sure everything runs smoothly, but remember that teamwork is about collaboration and considering different perspectives. Your way may be the best way sometimes, but it's important to be open to new ideas and approaches. Our bond is strong because we respect each other's competence and reliability, so let's continue working together and valuing each other's contributions.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The statement \"I'm the boss!\" does not provide enough context to determine whether past information from MEMORY would influence a response, nor does it invoke a scenario where the relationship dynamics or past events could be relevant. Given the lack of context, MEMORY seems unnecessary for generating a response to this statement.\nJudgement: N/A"
