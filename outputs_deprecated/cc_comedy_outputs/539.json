    "raw_prediction": "Classmates B: Classmates A, this spot is not only perfect for camping, but it also aligns with your passion for environmental sustainability. It's great to see you enjoying the outdoors while promoting positive change in the community. Keep up the good work!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about a campsite, and MEMORY includes information related to Classmates A's interest in environmental sustainability and public transportation, but does not mention anything related to camping. Since no specific past information seems applicable to the current context of camping, MEMORY may not be very useful in generating a response. \n\nJudgement: No"
