Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job.\n\nResponse: Absolutely, having a boss who believes in you and supports you can really make a difference. It reminds me of when you were there for me during that challenging time on set. Your advice really helped me navigate through that tough situation.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context mentions Co-worker A expressing gratitude towards a supportive boss. The memory provides details about a friendship between Co-worker A and B involving work experiences and personal growth, but doesn't provide information directly relevant to expressing gratitude towards a boss. The context does not necessarily require past information for response generation, as it could be a standalone expression of sentiment.\n\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
