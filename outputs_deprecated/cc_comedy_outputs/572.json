    "raw_prediction": "Neighbors A: I know what you mean, it can be tough to stay focused sometimes. Maybe you could try setting some specific goals for your project, just like when I build houses. Breaking it down into smaller tasks might help you stay on track. And hey, if you need any help with organizing or planning, I'm always here for you. Just like how I'm helping Neighbors B settle into their new home.",
