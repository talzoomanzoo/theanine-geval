    "raw_prediction": "Classmates A: Hey, Classmates B, don't be too hard on yourself for spilling your lunch. Remember, we all make mistakes. You handled it well, just like you always do in tough situations. Keep your head up and don't let a little embarrassment get you down. You're stronger than you think.\n\nClassmates B: Thanks, Classmates A. Your words mean a lot to me. I'll try to remember to own up to my mistakes and move on, just like you do. Your determination and positive attitude are truly inspiring. Let's face this challenge together and come out stronger on the other side.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The Dialogue Context does not require the use of past information. It is a straightforward question about Classmates B's current physical state. The information within MEMORY about past relationships, events, or Classmates A's personality traits does not seem relevant to generating an appropriate response for Classmates A's query about sunburn.\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
