I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed.\nClassmates A: Embarrassed? Why?\nClassmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier.\nClassmates A: Come on, tell me! I won't judge you, I promise.\nClassmates B: Well, I accidentally spilled my lunch all over myself in front of some people.\nClassmates A: (laughs) That's it? That's why you're embarrassed? I thought it was something serious.\nClassmates B: Yeah, I guess I just got caught up in the moment. But hey, at least it's not as bad as the time we got lost in space together, right?\nClassmates A: Oh, I remember that! Good times. We always manage to find our way back, no matter what. You'll get through this embarrassment too, don't worry.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about Classmates B having a red and splotchy face, possibly from sunburn. The MEMORY does not contain any specific information regarding previous instances of sun exposure, skin conditions, or health issues that might explain Classmates B's current situation. The character traits, relationship insights, and events described in MEMORY do not directly correlate to the context of sunburn.\nJudgement: No"
