    "raw_prediction": "Husband: You're right, I should give brainstorming with you another shot. Your ideas always help me see things from a different perspective. And maybe revisiting those writing prompts from our creative writing class will spark some new ideas. Thanks for always being so supportive and encouraging, it means a lot to me.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves the husband expressing difficulty in finding new ideas for his writing. While the MEMORY contains personal and relationship characteristics of support, patience, and encouragement from the wife, it does not specifically provide past instances or information that directly relate to helping with new idea generation for writing. The context does not seem to require past information for responding to the husband's current problem.\n\nJudgement: N/A"
