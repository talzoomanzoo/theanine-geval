    "raw_prediction": "Co-workers B: Co-workers A, I understand that you have strong feelings for the bride, but kidnapping her is not the answer. Just like how you intervened in that fight and showed bravery, I know you have the strength to overcome these feelings in a positive way. Let's find a way to support you in this difficult situation without causing harm to anyone. Remember, true love is about respecting and caring for others, not controlling them.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves Co-workers A mentioning a plan to \"steal\" a bride, which suggests a potentially mischievous or serious intent that could impact social dynamics or legal boundaries. The MEMORY provides background information about Co-workers A's character, particularly their strong moral values and their supportive relationship with Co-workers B. This background can provide helpful context for understanding Co-workers A's intentions or determining if they are speaking metaphorically, thus guiding an appropriate response.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
