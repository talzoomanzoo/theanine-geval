Remember, just like how you have shown dedication and growth in your decision-making skills, this is also an opportunity for you to connect with new people and make a difference in this community. You have the strength and determination to overcome this loneliness and create meaningful relationships. I believe in you and your ability to make a positive impact, just like you have shown in the past.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT describes the Mentee's feelings of loneliness in a new city due to missing old friends. The MEMORY provides background information on the supportive relationship between Mentor and Mentee, as well as details on Mentee's decision-making capabilities and past experiences of seeking advice from Mentor. This information is indeed helpful as it suggests that Mentor is likely to offer emotional support and useful advice, which the Mentee values. Thus, the MEMORY aids in generating a relevant and supportive response from the Mentor.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
