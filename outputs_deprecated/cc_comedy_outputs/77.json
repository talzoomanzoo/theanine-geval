    "raw_prediction": "Neighbors B: Maybe you could use your telekinetic abilities to help with dinner tonight. It could be a fun way to relax and show off your skills without having to leave the house for the family dinner. Plus, I'm always up for trying new recipes with you!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT shows Neighbors A asking if Neighbors B (or possibly Unknown) can keep a secret, which does not inherently require the past information outlined in MEMORY. There is no indication that Neighbors A's interests, their shared experiences, or their telekinetic abilities are directly relevant to maintaining a secret or the nature of the secret itself. Therefore, past information is not necessary for generating a response.\nJudgement: N/A"
