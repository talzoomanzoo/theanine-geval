I'm so proud of the person you've become, and I'm grateful for the bond we share. Watching the sunrise together is just one of the many moments that remind me how lucky I am to have you in my life.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context focuses on the parent expressing the value of being a good listener, which is an important life skill. The memory contains information mainly about the parent's personality, relationship with the child, and past events. None of this information directly supports or relates to the specific topic of being a good listener. Hence, it is not helpful for generating a related response.\nJudgement: \"No\""
