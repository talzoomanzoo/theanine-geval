    "raw_prediction": "Neighbors B: It sounds like you're really overwhelmed by the thought of going to the family dinner tonight. I remember you mentioning how important it is to take care of your own needs. Maybe you could try talking to your mom about how you're feeling and see if there's a way for you to compromise and still get some time to relax at home. Just remember, it's okay to speak up for yourself and prioritize your well-being.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves a request to keep a secret, which does not appear to be related to the past interactions or shared interests between Neighbors A and Neighbors B as recorded in the memory. The memory primarily contains information about past interactions related to shared meals, telekinesis, and hobbies, none of which seem directly helpful for responding to a request about keeping a secret. Judgment: \"No\""
