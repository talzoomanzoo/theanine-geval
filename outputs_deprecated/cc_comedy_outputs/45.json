    "raw_prediction": "Co-workers B: Co-workers A, I understand that you have strong feelings for the bride, but kidnapping her is not the answer. It's important to respect her choices and feelings. Remember how we always support each other and strive to make the world a better place through kindness and support? Let's find a healthier way to deal with your emotions and move forward in a positive direction.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief Explanation: The dialogue context involves a discussion of a mischievous plan by Co-workers A to interfere with a wedding. This scenario is a shift from the usual supportive and positive interactions described in the memory. The memory includes past events highlighting support, compassion, and positive actions. The current context seems unrelated to these themes of support and kindness.\n\nJudgment: No"
