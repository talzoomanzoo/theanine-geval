    "raw_prediction": "Neighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks? I find that breaking things down into smaller chunks helps me stay focused and motivated. Maybe we can work on setting some goals together to help you get this project done on time. Remember, small steps can lead to big accomplishments!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT reflects a situation where Neighbors A is trying to focus on completing a project before a deadline. The MEMORY includes details about their supportive relationship, shared events, and mutual encouragement to make a positive impact. Although the MEMORY does highlight some aspects of a supportive dynamic, it does not directly contain information relevant to Neighbors A's challenge of focusing on a project. Thus, it doesn't provide specific past information related to focus or project management that Unknown might need to generate a proper response.\nJudgement: No"
