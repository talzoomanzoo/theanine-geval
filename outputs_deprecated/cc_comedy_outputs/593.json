    "raw_prediction": "Wife: Remember when you faced your fear of public speaking during your fifth-grade presentation? You can do this too. Sometimes, the biggest breakthroughs come from taking risks. Just like how you conquered that fear back then, I know you can step out of your comfort zone with your writing now. I believe in you.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves the Husband feeling stuck with his writing and searching for new ideas. The memory contains information about his relationship with his wife, his past interactions and some personal traits, but none of these seem immediately relevant to solving his current creative block. Therefore, the memory doesn't provide the specific past information needed to help the language model generate a proper response.\nJudgement: No"
