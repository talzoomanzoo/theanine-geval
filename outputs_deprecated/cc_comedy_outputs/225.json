    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY mentions that Neighbors B is supportive and understanding and has shared experiences with Neighbors A about career changes and UFO sightings. However, the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about Neighbors A becoming a millionaire, which does not seem directly related to the past events or topics described in the MEMORY. Therefore, the MEMORY does not contain specific helpful information related to the current topic of wealth or becoming a millionaire.\nJudgement: No"
