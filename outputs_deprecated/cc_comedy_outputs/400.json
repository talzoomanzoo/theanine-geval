    "raw_prediction": "Classmates B: Well, I was trying to do something new and challenging, but things didn't go as planned. I guess I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed about it. But hey, I know I can always count on you for support, just like when we were drifting through space with our oxygen running low. Your determination and perseverance inspire me to keep pushing forward, even in tough times. Thank you for always being there for me, even when things get scary.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about Classmates B's physical condition (possibly sunburn), which is not directly related to any of Classmates A's characteristics or their shared history and experiences. MEMORY focuses on Classmates A's determination, their supportive relationship during challenging times, and space exploration experiences, which are unrelated to addressing Classmates B's face condition. Therefore, MEMORY does not contain helpful past information for this context.\n\nJudgement: No"
