    "raw_prediction": "Neighbors B: You know, Neighbors A, just like how you're working hard to finish building my house quickly, maybe you can apply that same dedication to finishing your project before the deadline. I believe in you and your ability to get things done efficiently. And don't forget, just like how you bring beauty to our community with your flowers, you can bring success to your project by staying focused and motivated.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about Neighbors A needing focus to finish a project, possibly indicating stress or the need for concentration. The MEMORY does not provide any specific past information related to Neighbors A's focus issues or methods that help them concentrate. The MEMORY mostly describes Neighbors A's personality, interests, relationships, and a construction event, which are not directly helpful in the context of needing focus on a project.\n\nJudgement: No"
