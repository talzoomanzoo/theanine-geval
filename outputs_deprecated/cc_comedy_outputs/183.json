I'm so proud of you for starting this new project, and I know you've put a lot of effort into it. I'm always here to support you, Parent.

MEMORY contains information about the Child's supportive and appreciative nature and the overall supportive and caring relationship between Child and Parent, which might influence how Child responds. This is potentially useful for generating an empathetic and supportive response to the Parent's new project.\nJudgement: Yes"
