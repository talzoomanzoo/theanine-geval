I'm a millionaire now!\nNeighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen?\nNeighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest.\nNeighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations! What are you going to do with all that money?\nNeighbors A: Well, first I'm going to pay off my mortgage and all my debts. After that, I think I'll take a nice long vacation and maybe donate some to charity.\nNeighbors B: That's very generous of you. Have you thought about investing any of it?\nNeighbors A: Yes, actually. I've been doing some research and I think I want to invest in some stocks and maybe even start my own business.\nNeighbors B: That sounds like a great idea. You have the opportunity to do so much with your newfound wealth.\nNeighbors A: Definitely. It's funny how things can change so quickly. Just a few years ago, I was stuck in a job I hated and now I have all this freedom.\nNeighbors B: Speaking of jobs, have you thought about what you want to do now? You don't really have to work if you don't want to.\nNeighbors A: I know, but I don't think I could ever completely give up working. Plus, I have some ideas for businesses that I want to pursue. I think this money will give me the push I need to start something new.\n\n[MEMORY]\nNeighbors A appreciates Neighbors B's understanding and willingness to listen and talk about the experience, which leads to Neighbor A suggesting planning something else to do together over the weekend. This conversation transitions into how Neighbors A is feeling stagnant in their current job and is looking for more growth and challenge, ultimately causing Neighbors A to make a big career change recently and become much happier.",
