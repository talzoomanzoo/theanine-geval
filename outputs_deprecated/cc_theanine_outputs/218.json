I've been doing it every day for the past week and it's made such a difference.\nNeighbors B: That's really interesting. I've heard that breathing exercises can be really helpful for reducing stress and anxiety.\nNeighbors A: Yes, it definitely has helped me with that. Plus, it's something that I can easily do anywhere, whether I'm at home or out running errands.\nNeighbors B: That's great. It's always good to have a simple tool like that to help manage stress. \nNeighbors A: Speaking of managing stress, remember a few years ago when I pushed your shoulder because I wanted you to accept me?\nNeighbors B: Oh yeah, I do remember that. That was a stressful time for both of us.\nNeighbors A: It definitely was. But I'm so glad that we've been able to move past that and have a good neighborly relationship now.\nNeighbors B: Me too. And remember when you found that great park a few years ago?\n\n[MEMORY]\nNeighbors A showed appreciation for Neighbors B's actions in the neighborhood, leading to Neighbors A being willing to take things slow in their relationship with Neighbors B. This resulted in Neighbors B reassuring Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasizing their current friendship. \nNeighbors A ordered a large cheese pizza with extra sauce for Neighbors B, highlighting the value of their friendship. This conversation transitioned to Neighbor A's daughter starting high school, which has been a significant adjustment for the family.",
