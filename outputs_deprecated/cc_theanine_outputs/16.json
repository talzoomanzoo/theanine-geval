I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\nMentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering.\nMentor: And remember, it's also important to keep in touch with your old friends. You can schedule video calls or even plan a visit back home.\n\n[MEMORY]\n1. The Mentor acknowledges the Mentee's work in advocacy for women and girls and praises their dedication to their values, causing Mentee to agree to go back to the store to make things right and express gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n\n2. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace in reaction to the Mentor believing the Mentee's work has been influential and that they will continue to make an impact in the world.\n\n3. The Mentee hopes to inspire others to join the cause of gender equality and fighting discrimination, wanting to express gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process. This leads to Mentee feeling overwhelmed with the college application process, which is on the same topic as Mentee taking shoes from the store without paying because they couldn't afford them.",
