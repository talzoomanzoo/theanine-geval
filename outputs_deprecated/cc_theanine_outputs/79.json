Plus, maybe you can compromise and go to the dinner for a little while and then come back home to relax.\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, thanks for the advice.\n\n[MEMORY]\nNeighbors A and B are discussing the idea of having telekinetic abilities, and Neighbors B is excited and supportive of Neighbors A's new ability. Neighbors B offers support and suggests planning a dinner to celebrate Neighbor A's new adventures in learning.\n\nNeighbors A enjoys cooking and made roasted vegetables and quinoa for dinner. Neighbors A and B joke about the fun aspects of using telekinesis to surprise people, and Neighbors B is excited and supportive of Neighbors A's new ability. Neighbor A feels there is no room for growth or new projects at their current job.\n\nNeighbors A compares mastering telekinesis to cooking, requiring patience and trial-and-error, and is considering incorporating their telekinesis into their cooking in the future.",

Therefore, the past information is not helpful in this case.\nJudgement: \"No\""
