I'm a millionaire now!\nNeighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen?\nNeighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest.\nNeighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations! What are you going to do with all that money?\nNeighbors A: Well, first I'm going to pay off my mortgage and all my debts. After that, I think I'll take a nice long vacation and maybe donate some to charity.\nNeighbors B: That's very generous of you. Have you thought about investing any of it?\nNeighbors A: Yes, actually. I've been doing some research and I think I want to invest in some stocks and maybe even start my own business.\nNeighbors B: That sounds like a great idea. You have the opportunity to do so much with your newfound wealth.\nNeighbors A: Definitely. It's funny how things can change so quickly. Just a few years ago, I was stuck in a job I hated and now I have all this freedom.\n\n[MEMORY]\nNeighbors B is supportive and believes Neighbors A's story about becoming a millionaire, suggesting looking up UFO sightings in the area. Neighbors A is tired from work and needs to catch up on sleep, but Neighbors B has been supportive of Neighbors A's job search, offering to connect them with people in different industries, which caused Neighbors A to make a big career change recently and become much happier. Neighbors A plans to do some research and possibly report the sighting of the UFO, and suggests planning something else to do together over the weekend, while also planning to start looking for new opportunities soon and updating their resume and start networking, which changed when Neighbors A took the leap to make a change and is glad they did. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's decision to make a big career change and admires the courage it took.",
