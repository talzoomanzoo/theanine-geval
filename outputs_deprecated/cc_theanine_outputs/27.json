Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\nNeighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again.\nNeighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower?\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work.\n\n[MEMORY]\nNeighbors A and B mentioned mowing the lawn with an old push mower, indicating they are responsible for the yard work, causing Neighbor A to feel pressured to look perfect all the time by their mom.\nNeighbors A and B are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together, as Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\nBoth Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn, and Neighbor A enjoys spending time in Neighbor B's cozy home and wants to hang out more often.",
