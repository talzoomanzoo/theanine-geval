I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\nCo-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on.\nCo-workers A: I know you're right, Co-workers B. I just don't know how to get over this feeling.\nCo-workers B: Maybe try talking to someone about it. A therapist or a trusted friend. They can help you work through these emotions in a healthy way.\n\n[MEMORY]\nCo-worker B's willingness to help others was evident when they assisted a customer last week. This trait was further highlighted when Co-worker A borrowed a pencil without asking and felt guilty about it. \nAfter Co-worker A spoke with the police about the incident, the women involved were thankful. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\nReflecting on Co-worker B's past actions, Co-worker A is remembered for their bravery and strength in various situations. Co-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity, noting their ability to stay optimistic even in challenging circumstances, such as the accident where they lost their hands and feet.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY provides information such as Co-worker A's past character traits and incidents. However, these pieces of information do not seem to directly affect the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Co-worker A's extreme idea of preventing a woman from marrying someone else. The dialogue goes on about love, decisions, and getting professional help, none of which is covered in the memory.\nJudgement: No"
