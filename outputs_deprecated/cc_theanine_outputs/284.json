This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\nTeacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation?\nStudent: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle.\n\n[MEMORY]\nThe student felt rewarded by the experience of being aware of surroundings and acting quickly in emergencies. This led to the teacher offering support and reassurance, emphasizing their availability to talk. Furthermore, both the teacher and student share a positive and understanding relationship.\n\nThe teacher's encouragement for the student to prioritize safety and help others caused the student to mention feeling stressed lately, potentially leading to an outburst. As a result, the student expresses excitement about retiring and spending time with their grandkids, already planning fun activities.\n\nThe student's appreciation for the rewarding experience of being aware of surroundings and acting quickly in emergencies was echoed in their gratitude towards the teacher's support. The student also apologized to the teacher for yelling in the hallway, acknowledging it was out of character and seeking to move past it.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory given talks about the student's experiences and feelings about emergencies, their relationship with the teacher, and their future plans - none of these have any relation to the dialogue context where the student is talking about their experience with hot sauce. Hence, the memory does not provide any helpful past information for the teacher to generate their next response.\nJudgement: \"No\""
