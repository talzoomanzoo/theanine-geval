That meant a lot to me.\nCo-workers A: Of course I remember! I'm happy we're friends again.\nCo-workers B: Me too. And do you still have that baby doll and rattle you bought a couple of years ago?\nCo-workers A: Yes, actually! I gave them to my niece and she loves them.\n\n[MEMORY]\nCo-worker A takes pride in their work and enjoys helping others, while both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value communication and understanding in relationships.
