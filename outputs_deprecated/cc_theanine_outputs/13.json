I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\n\n[MEMORY]\n1. The Mentor has been guiding and supporting the Mentee in their work for years, which causes the Mentee to be offered a job and decide to take the job in the city.\n2.

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory includes the Mentee's professional background and aspiration, but it does not provide relevant information that could be helpful in generating a proper response to the Mentee's feeling of loneliness in the city. The relevance of the memory here would depend on whether it contains details about the Mentee's hobbies, interests, and personality traits that could be relevant in suggesting ways to make new connections or feel less lonely.\nJudgement: \"No\""
