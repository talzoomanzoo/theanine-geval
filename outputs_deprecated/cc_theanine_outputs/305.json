I didn't realize there was any confusion about that.\nNeighbors A: Well, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page. I don't want any misunderstandings in the future.\nNeighbors B: I understand. Is there anything else we should do to make sure we're clear about this?\nNeighbors A: I don't think so, but if you have any other suggestions, I'm open to hearing them.\nNeighbors B: No, I think the line is a good idea. It's clear and simple.\nNeighbors A: Great. Hey, speaking of lines and boundaries, remember when we talked about my promotion at work? I had to set some clear boundaries with my team about what I expected from them.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember. How did that go?\nNeighbors A: It was tough at first, but eventually, everyone respected the boundaries I set and our team was more productive because of it.\nNeighbors B: That's great to hear. It's important to set boundaries and stick to them if you want to be successful in any area of your life.\n\n[MEMORY]\nNeighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B. This leads to Neighbor A believing in setting goals, developing a positive attitude, and taking action for personal development and career advancement. As a result, Neighbor A offers to help Neighbors B with getting into a workout routine, and Neighbor B suggests working out together to make it more enjoyable for both of them.",
