I thought we were happy together.\nNeighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left?\n\n[MEMORY]\nNeighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there. This change led to Neighbor A appreciating the emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during their time of grief. Neighbor A was tired of living in a run-down apartment complex, which caused them and Neighbor B to become neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood. Furthermore, Neighbor B's mention of the affluent neighborhood made Neighbor A want to go for walks, leading to both neighbors enjoying walks together, especially to the park. Their shared love for the park has strengthened their close friendship, with shared memories of spending time together there.",
