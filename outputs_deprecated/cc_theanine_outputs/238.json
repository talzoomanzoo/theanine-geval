I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.\nNeighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset?\nNeighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore.\nNeighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end job.\n\n[MEMORY]\nNeighbor A emphasized the importance of maintaining belongings for cost-effectiveness, both indoors and outdoors. This led Neighbors B to appreciate the sense of community that arises from mutual assistance. As a result, Neighbors A and B actively support each other. \nNeighbor A discussed the importance of keeping a tree house clean to prevent insects and spiders from inhabiting it. This topic resonated with Neighbors A and B, who reside in the same neighborhood and often assist each other with various tasks.
