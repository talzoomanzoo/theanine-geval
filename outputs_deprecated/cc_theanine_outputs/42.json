You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\n\n[MEMORY]\n1. Co-worker B mentioned helping a customer resolve an issue last week, showing a willingness to assist others. This reminds Co-worker A of the time when Co-worker B was supportive and willing to help in any way. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it. \n2. Co-worker A spoke with the police about the incident and the women involved were thankful. In reaction, Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time. \n3. Co-worker B mentioned helping a customer resolve an issue last week, showing a willingness to assist others.
