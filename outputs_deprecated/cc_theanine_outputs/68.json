    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory does not provide any useful information that can aid the model in generating the next response in the dialogue context. The memory talks about how Classmates A and B enjoy talking and studying together and Classmate A having a crush on Classmate B, but it does not touch upon the topic about their singing talent and career that the dialogue context is centered on. \nJudgement: \"No\""
