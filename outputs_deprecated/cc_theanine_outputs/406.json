Did you get sunburned?\nClassmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed.\nClassmates A: Embarrassed? Why?\nClassmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier.\nClassmates A: Come on, tell me! I won't judge you, I promise.\nClassmates B: Well, I accidentally spilled my lunch all over myself in front of some people.\nClassmates A: (laughs) That's it? That's why you're embarrassed? I thought it was something serious.\nClassmates B: (sighs) Yeah, it's silly. But still embarrassing.\nClassmates A: Don't worry about it. It happens to everyone. Remember the time I tripped and fell in front of the whole class during our presentation?\n\n[MEMORY]\n1. Classmates A successfully lands on a moon but is running out of oxygen and needs to repair the ship to get back home. This leads to Classmate A showing determination in fixing their spaceship after it was damaged in a meteor shower, which prompts Classmates B to praise Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n\n2. Classmates A and B have been on field trips to other planets or moons before, like Mars, which is a topic they both enjoy. This admiration makes Classmate B see Classmate A's attitude as a good example for others. As a result, both classmates value supporting and uplifting each other in their learning and growth, leading to Classmates A helping Classmates B out of friendship and believing in supporting each other.\n\n3. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during a difficult situation, which is hindered by Classmates A helping Classmates B out of friendship and believing in supporting each other.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory doesn't contain any relevant information to help generate a response to the dialogue context. The conversation revolves around the embarrassment and support between Classmates A and B about a situation at school. The memory, on the other hand, discusses experiences from trips to space, which doesn't relate to the dialogue context.\nJudgement: No"
