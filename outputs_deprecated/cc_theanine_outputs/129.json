I'll try to be more open-minded in the future.\nCo-workers B: That's all we can ask for. Remember that we're a team and we all have something valuable to contribute.\n\n[MEMORY]\n- Co-worker A and Co-worker B share a talent for collaborating well with others and resolving issues, which leads to Co-worker A giving Co-worker B a massage to help them relax.\n- Co-worker A's strong work ethic and positive influence on the workplace are recognized by Co-worker B, emphasizing the importance of communication and understanding in their relationship. This mutual appreciation allows both co-workers to enjoy connecting with each other, making work more enjoyable.\n- Co-worker B's belief that they had permanently lost their watch is overturned when Co-worker A returns it to them, resulting in the repair and rekindling of their friendship.",
