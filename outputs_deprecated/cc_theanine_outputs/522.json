I thought we were happy together.\nNeighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left?\nNeighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him.\nNeighbors B: That's not true, Neighbor A. You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are.\nNeighbors A: I just feel so lost right now. I don't know how to move on from this.\n\n[MEMORY]\nNeighbors A wanted to improve their quality of life by moving out of a run-down apartment complex. This desire led to Neighbors A and B becoming close neighbors who often spend time together outside of their neighborhood. As a result, they enjoy going for walks together, particularly to the park. In addition, Neighbor A is currently grieving the loss of their grandmother, seeking emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during this challenging time.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY provides background information about the close relationship between Neighbors A and B, their customary activities, and the fact that Neighbor A is dealing with the loss of their grandmother. Nevertheless, this information doesn't directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on Neighbor A's recent breakup and feelings of self-doubt. Therefore, it does not provide useful information for Neighbors B to generate a suitable response.\nJudgement: \"No\""
