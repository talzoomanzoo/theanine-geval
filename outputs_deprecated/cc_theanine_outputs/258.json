I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\nCo-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while.\nCo-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing?\nCo-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites.\nCo-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it.\nCo-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent.\nCo-workers A: Thanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it.\nCo-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have a hobby like that. Reminds me of when you uncovered that mystery a while back. You always seem to surprise us with your skills.\nCo-workers A: Haha, yeah. I do like a good challenge. Speaking of surprises, remember when I found out you were married? That was a shocker.\nCo-workers B: Oh gosh, yes. I forget sometimes that not everyone knows. But yeah, I've been married for a few years now.\nCo-workers A: Crazy how time flies. Like when we found out Ms. Singh was leaving our school. I still can't believe that was two years ago.\nCo-workers B: I know, right? She was such a great teacher. Speaking of which, have you heard anything about her lately?\nCo-workers A: Not really. I think she moved to another state, but I'm not sure where.\nCo-workers B: Ah, okay. Well, hopefully she's doing well wherever she is. But hey, getting back to your solo, I think you should definitely do it again sometime.\n\n[MEMORY]\nCo-worker A and Co-worker B both plan to treat themselves to a nice dinner with their paychecks. This leads to Co-worker A suggesting celebrating their detective work with drinks after work. As a result, Co-worker B, who is married, had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends. This then triggers happy memories from their time working together, which Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The information in MEMORY does not directly correlate to the current line of discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around Co-worker A's singing at church and the topic of their former teacher Ms. Singh. The elements in the memory about hiking, dinner with friends or celebrating detective work are not a necessary background information for the model to generate a coherent response.\nJudgement: \"No\""
