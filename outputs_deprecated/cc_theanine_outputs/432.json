It's a great way to better understand and empathize with others.\nMentee: That's exactly what I thought. I've been trying to imagine what personY is thinking lately. It's been helping me to understand their perspective a bit better.\nMentor: That's a great approach. Putting ourselves in someone else's shoes can help us see things from a different angle and see where they're coming from.\n\n[MEMORY]\n1. Mentee, after agreeing to try the advice and expressing gratitude towards Mentor, is currently living in an abusive and controlling cult, which changed when Mentor suggested Mentee volunteer at a local church or religious organization to gain experience, as Mentor became a mentor to help others going through similar situations.\n   \n2. After Mentee agreed to try the advice and expressed gratitude towards Mentor, Mentee reacted by taking the idea of teaching religion seriously and wanting to make a positive impact on people's lives. This made Mentee want to make a positive impact in people's lives and feel grateful for Mentor's support.\n\n3. Following Mentee agreeing to try the advice and expressing gratitude towards Mentor, Mentee reacted by feeling suffocated and eager to leave the cult. This reaction made Mentee want to help others who may be in abusive cults.",
