Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\nNeighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become.\n\n[MEMORY]\nNeighbor B's reminder of Neighbor A's potential to do good things referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them makes Neighbor A consider using their skills for good instead of evil.\nNeighbor A's enjoyment in building houses and finishing them quickly caused them to find building the new house challenging but rewarding with the help of friends.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The information in the memory is not relevant to the dialogue context. The memory talks about Neighbor A's skill in building houses and how they could use their skills for good instead of evil, while the dialogue is about Neighbor A procrastinating on a project and trying various ways to focus. Hence, the information in memory does not provide any helpful past information that could be used to generate a response for Neighbor A.\nJudgement: \"No\""
