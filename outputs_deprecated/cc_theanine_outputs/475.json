Classmates A is struggling with feeling competitive and the need to be the best at everything. This new challenge is worrying because they have not experienced similar pains before.\n2. Classmates A is always looking to challenge themselves and improve their skills. In response, Classmates B offers support and suggests finding a balance. Despite having a muscle strain in their arm, Classmate A did not go to the hospital.\n3. Classmates B offers support and suggests finding a balance.
