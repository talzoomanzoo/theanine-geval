What did you do there?\nCo-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done.\nCo-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends?\nCo-workers A: Ugh, don't remind me. That was such a disaster.\n\n[MEMORY]\nCo-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits, but Co-worker B is supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable. In return, Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides. Both co-workers show a supportive and caring attitude towards each other, which helps in their personal growth and mutual understanding.",
