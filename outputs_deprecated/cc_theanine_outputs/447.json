It's always nice to have someone you can count on.\nNeighbors A: That's true. And speaking of which, I'm helping another friend move next weekend.

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context is revolving around the theme of mutual aid between friends, sharing past experiences where they have helped each other, and present plans where one of them is helping another friend. The memory, however, is completely unrelated, discussing about a necklace bought from Neighbors B's shop and nothing about the mutual aid or past experiences they are discussing. \nJudgement: No"
