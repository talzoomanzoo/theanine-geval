Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking?\nCo-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you.\n\n[MEMORY]\nCo-worker A has made mistakes in the past but is trying to be more aware of their actions, which has led Co-worker B to move on from their arrest and appreciate Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior. As a result, Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A. Co-worker A is trying to be more conscious of how their actions impact others and avoid causing problems for anyone else, prompting Co-worker B to reassure them that making mistakes is okay as long as they learn from them. This reassurance from Co-worker B also encourages Co-worker A to have more confidence. Additionally, Co-worker B mentions that Co-worker A is responsible in their work, even if not always in other aspects of life, and reminds them of their progress and potential for success.",
