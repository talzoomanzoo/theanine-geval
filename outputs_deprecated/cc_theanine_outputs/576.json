Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\nNeighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become.\nNeighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice.\n\n[MEMORY]\nNeighbor A values their friendship with Neighbor B, describing them as a great neighbor, which causes Neighbor A to consider using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\nNeighbor B is grateful and surprised by the generous offer from Neighbor A, which reminds Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them, and Neighbor A believes that plants need sunlight, water, and love to thrive.\nNeighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly, which changed after having help from friends in building the new house, turning into finding building the new house challenging but rewarding.",
