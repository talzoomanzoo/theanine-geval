How does it work?\nParent: Well, I create the ads myself, and then I post them on my website. People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them.\nChild: Do you think people will pay to see your ads?\nParent: I don't know yet, but I hope so. I've put a lot of effort into creating some eye-catching ads.\nChild: That sounds cool, but why do you want to make money from ads?\nParent: Well, I want to have some extra income coming in. Plus, I enjoy being creative and making things, so this is a great way for me to combine those passions.\nChild: I see. Well, I hope it works out for you, Parent.\nParent: Thanks, Child. And who knows, maybe someday you can help me create some ads for the website.\n\n[MEMORY]\nThe Parent and Child have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores. This has changed as the Parent has seen a doctor and is taking medicine for their illness.",
