I wish I could do things on my own.\nClassmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others.\nClassmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone.\nClassmates A: You're not a burden, don't worry. And I'm always here to help you out.\nClassmates B: I appreciate that, but I don't want to always rely on others. I want to be more independent.\nClassmates A: I get it. Maybe there are some small things you can do on your own to start feeling more independent?\nClassmates B: Like what?\nClassmates A: Well, maybe you can start by making a list of things you'd like to do on your own and we can work on achieving those goals together.\nClassmates B: That sounds like a good idea. Thanks for understanding, Classmates A.\nClassmates A: Of course, I'm always here to support you. Hey, speaking of goals, remember when we talked about your guitar playing a few months ago? How's that going?\nClassmates B: It's going really well, thanks for asking! I've been practicing every day and I feel like I'm getting better.\nClassmates A: That's awesome! Have you thought about joining a band or playing gigs around town?\nClassmates B: Not really, I'm still a bit nervous about performing in front of people.\nClassmates A: I get it, performing can be scary. But maybe in a few months, we can work on setting a goal for you to do a small performance somewhere.\nClassmates B: That sounds like a challenge, but also kind of exciting. I'm in!\nClassmates A: Great, I'm looking forward to seeing you rock out on stage. Hey, remember when we talked about your new car a few hours ago? How's that going?\nClassmates B: I'm loving it! It's so much fun to drive. Thanks for asking, Classmates A.\nClassmates A: No problem, glad to hear it. Hey, I remember a few months ago when you talked about being reminded of your childhood and feeling emotional. How are you feeling about that now?\nClassmates B: I'm still feeling a bit emotional about it, but I've also been trying to focus on making new positive memories to replace the old ones.\nClassmates A: That's a great idea. It's important to acknowledge our emotions, but also not let them hold us back.\n\n[MEMORY]\n[Classmates A and B discussing their respective experiences shows they have a friendly and supportive relationship, as evidenced by their conversation about keeping up with homework in their math class.]\n[After talking about pursuing dreams, Classmates A and B plan to collaborate on music in the future, enjoying jamming together.]\n[Classmates A reminisces about childhood memories, including playing on swings and making music with friends, showing a connection to the topic of keeping up with homework in their math class.]\n[Classmates A's pursuit of their passion for music, following dreams, is admired by Classmates B, who also dreams of owning a Mustang GT since childhood.]",
