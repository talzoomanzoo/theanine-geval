Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\nNeighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become.\nNeighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along? \n\n[MEMORY]\nNeighbor A built a new house for Neighbor B with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. This act of kindness helped Neighbor B in creating a new house with amazing features. Neighbor B expressed their appreciation by reminding Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them. This made Neighbor A feel motivated to believe that plants need sunlight, water, and love to thrive. \n\nNeighbor A, who enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly, also possesses skills in manipulation and getting what they want. \n\nNeighbor B, excited about the new project, is looking forward to seeing the finished house. Building the new house was challenging but rewarding for Neighbor A.",
