What did you learn specifically?\nClassmates A: Oh, a lot of things. I learned how to use different programs and software for different tasks, and how to choose the right one depending on what I need to do.\n\n[MEMORY]\n- [Classmates A acknowledges the mistake and plans to learn from it.] - (React) - [Classmate B is a supportive friend who listens and offers to help.] - (HinderedBy) - [Classmates A and Classmates B are friends who help each other with schoolwork.] \n- [Classmates A acknowledges the mistake and plans to learn from it.] - (Changed) - [Classmates A has matured since then and learned from past mistakes.] \n- [Classmates B emphasizes the consequences of Classmates A's actions and the need for responsibility.] - (SameTopic) - [Classmates B and Classmates A used to dance a lot in middle school.]",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory doesn't provide any useful information that can help Classmate B to generate a proper response based on the dialogue context. The context of the dialogue is focused on a specific computer course that Classmate A has finished and what they learned from it, while the memory talks about Classmate A's past mistakes and dance in middle school.\nJudgement: No"
