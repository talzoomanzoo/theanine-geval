How about you?\nNeighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band.\nNeighbors B: Really? You had a band?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, we were called \"The Neighbors A Band.\" We used to play live shows around the city.\nNeighbors B: That's awesome! What kind of music did you guys play?\nNeighbors A: We played rock music, mostly covers but we also wrote some of our own songs.\nNeighbors B: Have you ever thought about starting the band again?\nNeighbors A: Not really, it was just a fun hobby back then. Plus, I don't think I have the same energy as I did when I was younger.\nNeighbors B: That's understandable. Do you still play any instruments?\nNeighbors A: I have a guitar but I haven't played it in a while. Maybe I should start practicing again.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Maybe you could even teach me a thing or two.\n\n[MEMORY]\n- Neighbor A offered to provide the name of their chiropractor to Neighbor B if they decide to go, which led to a discussion about playing together with toys and ended with Neighbor A appreciating the support and friendship of Neighbor B.\n- Neighbor A has been dealing with back pain for a few months but sought help from a chiropractor, avoiding surgery. Neighbor A looks forward to playing with Neighbor B again when feeling better, and Neighbor B is familiar with Neighbor A's dog and looking forward to playing with it again.
