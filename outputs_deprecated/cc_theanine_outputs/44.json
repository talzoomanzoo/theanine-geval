I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\n\n[MEMORY]\nCo-worker B showed a willingness to assist others by helping a customer resolve an issue last week. This demonstrates Co-worker B's supportive nature and readiness to help in any way. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it, similar to when they spoke with the police about an incident where the women involved were thankful. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time. \nCo-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help, leading Co-worker A to try to stay positive and focus on their recovery despite it being a daunting task. Co-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity, describing them as someone who can stay optimistic even in challenging situations, such as the accident where they lost their hands and feet.",
