I didn't realize there was any confusion about that.\nNeighbors A: Well, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page.

It's clear and simple.\nNeighbors A: Great. Hey, speaking of lines and boundaries, remember when we talked about my promotion at work? I had to set some clear boundaries with my team about what I expected from them.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember.
