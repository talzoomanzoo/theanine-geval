You don't have to remind us every five minutes.\nCo-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan.\nCo-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway.\nCo-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way.\nCo-workers B: And sometimes it is, but we all have different ideas and perspectives to bring to the table.\nCo-workers A: Okay, I see your point. I'll try to be more open-minded in the future.\n\n[MEMORY]\n- Co-worker A enjoys helping others and takes pride in their work, which leads to Co-worker A and Co-worker B excelling at working well with others and resolving issues. This results in Co-worker A giving Co-worker B a massage to help them relax.\n- Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace. Similarly, both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value communication and understanding in relationships, as well as enjoy taking moments to connect with each other to make work more enjoyable.\n- Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace, causing them to have a disagreement. However, they resolve it and become friends again, with Co-worker A returning Co-worker B's watch a few years ago being the cause of their rekindled friendship.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY offers some context about the personalities of and relationship between Co-workers A and B, but it does not contain any specific information that would directly inform or shape Co-worker B's next response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The dialogue essentially revolves around Co-worker A's tendency to exert control and be dominant, and Co-worker B's perspective on that. The MEMORY about Co-worker A's good work ethic, or them giving Co-worker B a massage, or returning Co-worker B's watch isn't necessary to generate a relevant next response.\nJudgement: No"
