    "raw_prediction": "You should never cheat, especially on something as serious as taxes. It's important to find legitimate ways to handle financial struggles. How can I support you through this?",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context is about Classmate A's situation that they cheated on their taxes. The MEMORY does provide some helpful context relating to Classmate A's financial circumstances (e.g., working at a grocery store to save for basketball training) and Classmate B's potential sensitivity towards this situation (giving advice, offering help). Therefore, this information could help Classmate B continue the conversation sympathetically or constructively.\nJudgement: Yes"
