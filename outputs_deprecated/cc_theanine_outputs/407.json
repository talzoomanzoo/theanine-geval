Did you get sunburned?\nClassmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed.\nClassmates A: Embarrassed? Why?\nClassmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier.\nClassmates A: Come on, tell me! I won't judge you, I promise.\nClassmates B: Well, I accidentally spilled my lunch all over myself in front of some people.\nClassmates A: (laughs) That's it? That's why you're embarrassed? I thought it was something serious.\nClassmates B: (sighs) Yeah, it's silly. But still embarrassing.\nClassmates A: Don't worry about it. It happens to everyone. Remember the time I tripped and fell in front of the whole class during our presentation?\nClassmates B: Oh yeah, that was pretty bad. But you handled it so well. You just got up, dusted yourself off, and continued with the presentation.\n\n[MEMORY]\n1. Classmates A praised Classmates B for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n2. Classmates B admires Classmates A's attitude and sees it as a good example for others.\n3. Classmate A believes in giving 110% effort in everything they do.",

The conversation is about an embarrassing moment Classmate B had, which is unrelated to the information given in MEMORY about a scary experience in space or the perseverance values held by Classmate A.\nJudgement: \"No\""
