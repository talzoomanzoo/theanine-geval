I'm a millionaire now!\nNeighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen?\nNeighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest.\nNeighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations! What are you going to do with all that money?\nNeighbors A: Well, first I'm going to pay off my mortgage and all my debts. After that, I think I'll take a nice long vacation and maybe donate some to charity.\nNeighbors B: That's very generous of you. Have you thought about investing any of it?\nNeighbors A: Yes, actually. I've been doing some research and I think I want to invest in some stocks and maybe even start my own business.\nNeighbors B: That sounds like a great idea. You have the opportunity to do so much with your newfound wealth.\n\n[MEMORY]\nNeighbors A is tired from work and needs to catch up on sleep. This causes Neighbors A to feel stagnant in their current job and look for more growth and challenge, leading to a big career change that makes them much happier now. Neighbors B has been supportive of Neighbors A's job search, offering to connect them with people in different industries, and admires the courage it took.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: While the memory provides additional context around Neighbor A's work and general situation, it is not directly relevant to the dialogue at hand, which primarily concerns the topic of an unexpected inheritance and the plans Neighbor A has for the money. The MEMORY could potentially be used to guide a line of query into what kind of business Neighbor A might want to start, given the previous job change, but it's not necessary for generating a proper next response in this specific dialogue context.\nJudgement: \"No\""
