Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job.\nCo-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work.\nCo-workers B: It's great to have that kind of positive reinforcement. Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated?\nCo-workers A: Oh yeah, I remember. I was so angry after blowing up that rabbit with the dynamite. But talking it out with you really helped me work through my emotions.\nCo-workers B: That's right. It's important to have someone to talk to when you're feeling overwhelmed or upset.\nCo-workers A: And speaking of talking it out, do you remember when I was a kid and I ran to our parents screaming because of that spider?\nCo-workers B: Ha, yes I do! It's funny to think about now, but phobias are no laughing matter.\nCo-workers A: Absolutely. And on a lighter note, I made a pair of wire earrings the other day. It was so much fun to create something beautiful with my own hands.\n\n[MEMORY]\nCo-worker B emphasized the importance of learning from mistakes and working together as a team, causing Co-worker B to acknowledge that some people have fears and suggests finding healthy ways to deal with frustrations. This led Co-worker A to overcome fears and anxieties to create beautiful earrings. \nCo-worker B expressed disapproval of Co-worker A's actions and suggested talking to the director to address the stressful situation, which caused Co-worker B to encourage Co-worker A to try relaxation techniques or find a hobby to de-stress and overcome fears, ultimately leading Co-worker A to create beautiful earrings. \nCo-worker B expressed disapproval of Co-worker A's actions and suggested talking to the director to address the stressful situation, which caused Co-worker B to encourage Co-worker A to try relaxation techniques or find a hobby to de-stress and overcome fears.
