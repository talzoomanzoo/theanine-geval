Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job.\nCo-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work.\n\n[MEMORY]\nCo-worker B was nervous about working with Co-worker A because of their talent as an actor. This caused Co-worker B to emphasize the importance of learning from mistakes and working together as a team. As a result, Co-worker A felt remorse for what they did and appreciated Co-worker B's understanding, leading them to be grateful for life experiences and open to new possibilities in the future.\n\nDuring their collaboration, both Co-worker A and Co-worker B felt that they brought out the best in each other.
