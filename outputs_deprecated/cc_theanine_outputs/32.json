But it was also a good workout.\nNeighbors B: I prefer to work out indoors where there's air conditioning.\nNeighbors A: Ha, I remember when I took off my jacket and put my feet up in your armchair. It was so warm that day.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, that was a hot day. I'm glad you felt comfortable in my home though.\nNeighbors A: You know, I really enjoy spending time with you. I want to get to know you even better.\n\n[MEMORY]\nNeighbors A and B, who have known each other for years, enjoy spending time together and want to get to know each other even better.

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory provides useful context about the ongoing friendship between Neighbors A & B. It places their conversation in a wider context of long-term friendship and their habits of reminiscing about the past. It also provides additional information about Neighbor A's enjoyment of Neighbor B's home, which aligns with the dialogue where Neighbor A mentions feeling comfortable in Neighbor B's home. However, the dialogue context does not directly refer to or require this information to generate a proper next response. \nJudgement: N/A"
