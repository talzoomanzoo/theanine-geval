    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context revolves around the student experiencing spicy food and the teacher discussing a tolerance build up over time. The information in memory, on the other hand, is about the student's personal issues, safety concerns, and family plans. There is no connection between the two.\nJudgement: No"
