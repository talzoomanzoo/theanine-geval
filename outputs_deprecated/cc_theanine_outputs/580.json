Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\nNeighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become.\nNeighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along? \nNeighbors A: It's finished! Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. It was a lot of work, but worth it in the end. \nNeighbors B: That's amazing, thanks for building me such a beautiful house. \nNeighbors A: Of course, I'm glad you like it. Remember when we watched the sunset over the London skyline? That was such a beautiful moment.\n\n[MEMORY]\nNeighbor A's enjoyment of building houses and finishing them quickly led to Neighbor A helping Neighbor B build a new house with amazing features. This act made Neighbor B grateful for the extra space and reminded Neighbor B of Neighbor A's potential to do good things. Additionally, Neighbor A's love for building houses prompted Neighbor A to take care of flowers as a calming activity.",
