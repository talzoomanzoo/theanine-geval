Did you get sunburned?\nClassmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed.\nClassmates A: Embarrassed? Why?\nClassmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier.\nClassmates A: Come on, tell me! I won't judge you, I promise.\n\n[MEMORY]\n1. Classmates A showed determination in fixing their spaceship after it was damaged in a meteor shower, which caused Classmates B to suggest redirecting the ship towards a nearby planet or moon for help. This led to Classmates B praising Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n\n2. Classmates A and B have been on field trips to other planets or moons before, like Mars, leading to Classmate B admiring Classmate A's attitude as a good example for others. This admiration was reciprocated when Classmate A patiently and helpfully taught driving material to Classmate B, who also mentioned that Classmate A helped them prepare for a driving test, showcasing patience and dedication.\n\n3. Classmates A expressed gratitude for Classmates B's support during a difficult situation, reflecting Classmate A's perseverance in repairing the spaceship and determination to not give up in challenging situations. This led to Classmates B praising Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.",
