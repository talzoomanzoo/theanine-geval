It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you?\nParent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference.\nChild: I'm glad you found someone to talk to. You know, I remember when we watched the sunrise together a few weeks ago. That was really special.\nParent: It was. I love being able to appreciate the beauty of nature. And you know, having my own place to live in the suburbs makes it even easier to do things like that.\n\n[MEMORY]\n1. The Parent and Child enjoy watching the sunrise together, finding it special and memorable.\n2. The Parent's past mistakes lead to finding hope and appreciating small moments, aiming to turn their life around.\n3. The Child is inspired by the Parent's story and suggests continuing the sunrise-watching tradition in the future.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY provides context for their past shared experiences (watching the sunrise) and the parent's personal history (past mistakes and hope), both of which are discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It holds important emotional context that a model representing the Child can use to generate a thoughtful and empathetic response to the Parent.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
