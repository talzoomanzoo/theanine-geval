It's a very fulfilling job.\nClassmates B: That's great to hear! How did you get into carpentry?\nClassmates A: My dad was a carpenter, so I grew up around it. I started by helping him out when I was young, and then I began to really enjoy it myself.\nClassmates B: That's awesome that you were able to learn from your dad and turn it into a career. Have you done any big projects lately?\nClassmates A: Yeah, I just finished building a custom bookshelf for a client. It was a challenging project, but I'm really happy with how it turned out.\nClassmates B: That's impressive! You must have a lot of skill to be able to build something like that.\nClassmates A: Thanks! It definitely takes a lot of practice and attention to detail. But I find it really rewarding to see a finished product that I created with my own two hands.\nClassmates B: I can imagine. It must also be nice to have a steady income from your work.\n\n[MEMORY]\n1. Classmate A supports the President and believes he is doing a good job. This aligns with Classmates A appreciating the support and encouragement from Classmates B, who in turn is supportive and encourages Classmate A to pursue their dream.\n2. Classmate A mentions the President's policies to boost job growth as progress in the economy, leading to Classmates A being interested in entrepreneurship and signing up for a seminar on starting a business. This causes Classmates A to attend the seminar, excited about applying that knowledge to future plans, and wanting to explore singing, a passion that they never thought possible until now.\n3. Classmate A supports the President and believes he is doing a good job, which is the same topic when Classmates A appreciates the support and encouragement from Classmates B. This leads to Classmates A wanting to get to know Classmates B better and become friends, and also considering reaching out to vocal coaches to improve singing skills.",
