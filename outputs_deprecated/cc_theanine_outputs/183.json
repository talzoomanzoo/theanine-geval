How does it work?\nParent: Well, I create the ads myself, and then I post them on my website. People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them.\nChild: Do you think people will pay to see your ads?\nParent: I don't know yet, but I hope so. I've put a lot of effort into creating some eye-catching ads.\nChild: That sounds cool, but why do you want to make money from ads?\nParent: Well, I want to have some extra income coming in. Plus, I enjoy being creative and making things, so this is a great way for me to combine those passions.\nChild: I see. Well, I hope it works out for you, Parent.\nParent: Thanks, Child. And who knows, maybe someday you can help me create some ads for the website.\nChild: Sure, that sounds like fun! Speaking of creativity, remember that time we made those homemade decorations together?\nParent: Yes, I do remember that. That was a fun afternoon.\nChild: It was! Maybe we can do that again someday.\n\n[MEMORY]\nThe Parent values cherishing moments with loved ones and stresses the unpredictability of life, which makes the Child feel it is unfair that they have to do certain chores because the Parent is too tired. The Child suggests creating a schedule for chores to ensure everyone contributes equally, and the Parent agrees to make an effort to start pulling their weight around the house and follow the chore schedule. In open communication, the parent and child discuss various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores, leading to the Parent being seen by a doctor and taking medicine for their illness. The Child expresses gratitude for being adopted by the parent and believes other children will be lucky to have them as a parent, supporting the idea of the Parent adopting more children and hoping for a happy home for them.",
