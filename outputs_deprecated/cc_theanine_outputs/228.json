The dialogue is about Neighbor A having inherited a large sum of money, and planning on what to do with it, whereas the memory is about Neighbor Aâ€™s past job search, which is not directly linked with the current conversation. Therefore, the memory is not required for Neighbor B to continue the dialogue.\nJudgement: \"No\""
