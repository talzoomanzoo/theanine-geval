I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\n\n[MEMORY]\n- The Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace. Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process, feeling overwhelmed with the college application process, and took shoes from the store without paying because they couldn't afford them.\n- The Mentor has been guiding and supporting the Mentee in their work for years, causing the Mentee to be offered a job and deciding to take the job in the city.",
