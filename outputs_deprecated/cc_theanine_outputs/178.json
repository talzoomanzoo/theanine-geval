How does it work?\nParent: Well, I create the ads myself, and then I post them on my website. People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them.\nChild: Do you think people will pay to see your ads?\nParent: I don't know yet, but I hope so. I've put a lot of effort into creating some eye-catching ads.\nChild: That sounds cool, but why do you want to make money from ads?\nParent: Well, I want to have some extra income coming in. Plus, I enjoy being creative and making things, so this is a great way for me to combine those passions.\n\n[MEMORY]\nThe Parent acknowledges being lazy about washing dishes and promises to contribute more to keeping the home clean. This leads to the Parent agreeing to make an effort to start pulling their weight around the house and follow the chore schedule. As a result, the parent and child have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores.",
