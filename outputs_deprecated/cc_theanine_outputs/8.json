It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you?\nParent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference.\nChild: I'm glad you found someone to talk to. You know, I remember when we watched the sunrise together a few weeks ago. That was really special.\nParent: It was. I love being able to appreciate the beauty of nature. And you know, having my own place to live in the suburbs makes it even easier to do things like that.\nChild: Yeah, your house is really nice. You've always been good at taking care of yourself.\nParent: Well, I've always valued my independence. Even as a kid, I wanted to do things on my own. That's why I decided to live on my own a few years ago.\n\n[MEMORY]\n1. The parent values independence and self-sufficiency. This stems from wanting to provide a safe and stable environment for the child.\n2. The child is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes. This reaction was inspired by the parent's story and willingness to appreciate small moments, leading to the parent living in a little house in the suburbs that they love.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The discussion between Child and Parent in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT refers to the Parent's past, their values and their current lifestyle. The MEMORY is appropriate to these topics since it mentions the Parent's values and the child's support towards their parent, which aligns precisely with their conversation. Thus, the MEMORY contains beneficial information for the Child to craft a suitable response. \nJudgement: \"Yes\""
