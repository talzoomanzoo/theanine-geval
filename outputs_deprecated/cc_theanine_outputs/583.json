Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\nNeighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become.\nNeighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along? \nNeighbors A: It's finished! Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. It was a lot of work, but worth it in the end. \nNeighbors B: That's amazing, thanks for building me such a beautiful house. \nNeighbors A: Of course, I'm glad you like it. Remember when we watched the sunset over the London skyline? That was such a beautiful moment.\nNeighbors B: Yes, I still remember the pink and orange hues reflecting off the buildings. It was breathtaking.\nNeighbors A: Speaking of London, have you heard about those recent cases of identity theft? It's terrible that people like that exist.\nNeighbors B: Yes, it's scary to think someone could steal your identity and ruin your life like that.\n\n[MEMORY]\nNeighbor A's enjoyment of building houses and finishing them quickly led to Neighbor A helping Neighbor B build a new house with amazing features. This act caused Neighbor B to remind Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them. Subsequently, Neighbor A expressed a desire to believe that plants need sunlight, water, and love to thrive.",
