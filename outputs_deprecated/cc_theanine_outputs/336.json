    "raw_prediction": "Maybe you can start a new hobby that doesn't require as much energy. Have you thought about picking up a musical instrument again?",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory contains useful information about Neighbor A's back pain, which now seems to be relevant, as it can partially explain why Neighbor A might not think about starting the band again because it could worsen the condition. Additionally, having a history of playing together, paired with Neighbors A's comment about not having the same energy, can provide an empathetic response from Neighbors B.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
