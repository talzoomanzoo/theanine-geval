Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking?\nCo-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you.\nCo-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember that conversation. What about it?\nCo-workers A: Well, I wanted to share some good news with you. I've been recently promoted to the night shift and have been doing a great job. I think I've come a long way since those days.\nCo-workers B: That's awesome, congratulations! I'm proud of you and all the hard work you've put in. You've definitely grown and matured in the workplace.\nCo-workers A: Thank you, I appreciate that. But I have to admit, I'm still a bit nervous about being wrong. Remember when we talked about my constantly questioning myself and second-guessing my decisions?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember that.

I recently auditioned for a major singing competition and was chosen as a finalist.\nCo-workers B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations, I had no idea you were still pursuing singing.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it's always been a passion of mine. It's nice to know that my hard work is paying off.
