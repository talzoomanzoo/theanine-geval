It's all about promoting under-the-radar artists.\nClassmates B: I haven't had a chance to yet, but that sounds really cool! What inspired you to start it?\nClassmates A: Well, I've always had a passion for the arts, but I was too afraid to pursue it. I finally realized that it's what I really love, and I wanted to share that love with others.\nClassmates B: That's amazing. It takes a lot of courage to pursue your passions like that.\nClassmates A: Yeah, it was scary at first, but the response has been really positive. I'm so glad I finally decided to take the leap.\nClassmates B: I'm proud of you. It's always great to see someone following their dreams.\nClassmates A: Thanks, it's been a journey, but I'm really happy with where I am now. It's crazy to think that years ago, I was so hesitant to even share this part of myself.\n\n[MEMORY]\n1. Classmates A and B both emphasize the significance of exploring new opportunities and embracing risks for personal growth.\n2. Classmates B's encouragement led Classmates A to venture beyond their comfort zone and seek personal development, aligning with A's desire to lead a fulfilling life independently.\n3.
