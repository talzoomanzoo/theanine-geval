Plus, maybe you can compromise and go to the dinner for a little while and then come back home to relax.\n\n[MEMORY]\nNeighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation. They then joke about the fun aspects of using telekinesis to surprise people. Neighbors B is excited and supportive of Neighbors A's new ability. Neighbor A feels there is no room for growth or new projects at their current job.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory does not contain useful information for Neighbors A to generate the next response. The dialogue context involves a conversation about a family dinner and Neighbors A's desire to skip it, whereas the memory discusses cooking preparation, telekinesis, and dissatisfaction at work. None of these past topics relate to Neighbors A's current situation.\nJudgement: \"No\""
