I didn't realize there was any confusion about that.\nNeighbors A: Well, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page. I don't want any misunderstandings in the future.\nNeighbors B: I understand. Is there anything else we should do to make sure we're clear about this?\nNeighbors A: I don't think so, but if you have any other suggestions, I'm open to hearing them.\nNeighbors B: No, I think the line is a good idea. It's clear and simple.\n\n[MEMORY]\nNeighbor B admires Neighbor A's career advancement, expresses interest in borrowing the personal development book, and offers to be more supportive by checking in on Neighbor A more often. \nNeighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B, and they both emphasize the importance of taking care of each other as neighbors. \nNeighbor A and Neighbor B went to a concert together in the past and had a great time, but recently, Neighbor A was promoted to manager and is struggling to adjust to the new responsibilities.",
