You always seem to know just what to do to make people feel better.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I've had a lot of practice over the years. It's just something that comes naturally to me.\nCo-workers B: Do you remember that time when you were led to a safe place by the commander? You must have felt pretty grateful for his guidance then.\nCo-workers A: Absolutely. It was a really tough time and I was so relieved to have someone show me the way. I try to pay it forward by being that kind of leader for others.\n\n[MEMORY]\n1.
