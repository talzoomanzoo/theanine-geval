    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory neither does provide helpful information for generating a proper response nor does it contradict the dialogue context. The dialogue context doesn't really require any information from the memory. The section about appreciating the little things in life is kind of hinted at in the dialogue, but it might not be necessarily helpful for generating a response.\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
