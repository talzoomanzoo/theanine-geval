    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context does not provide enough information to determine whether the information in the memory would be helpful for Classmate A's next response. At this point, we only know that Classmate A wants to discuss something important, but we don't know what that topic is. If the discussion moves towards their shared interests, future aspirations, or their relationship, then the memory would be useful.\nJudgement: N/A"
