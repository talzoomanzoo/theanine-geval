    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The information provided in MEMORY is about the husband's activities outside work and his faith journey, his wife's support in these areas, and their involvement in their church community. However, the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about the husband's effort to make their apartment cozy by hanging lights and candles and the wife's appreciation of it. There's no connection between them, hence the MEMORY is not helpful in generating the next response.\nJudgement: \"No\""
