    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory does not provide any helpful information for Neighbor B to base their next response. The context mainly revolves around Neighbor A avoiding a family dinner, the possibility of compromising, as well as going out for dinners with Neighbor B. The memory mentions a past dinner and Neighbor A's cooking skills, however, this isn't relevant for Neighbor's B next response.\nJudgement: No"
