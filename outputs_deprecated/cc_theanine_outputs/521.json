I thought we were happy together.\nNeighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left?\nNeighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him.\nNeighbors B: That's not true, Neighbor A. You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are.\n\n[MEMORY]\nNeighbor A recently moved into the neighborhood and wanted to live in a nicer area, which is why they have a bit of a drive to get to the park where they meet with Neighbor B. This change led to both of them enjoying going for walks together, especially to the park. As a result, Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time. \n\nNeighbor A was tired of living in a run-down apartment complex and wanted to improve their quality of life, which caused them and Neighbor B to become neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood. This connection led to both of them enjoying going for walks together, especially to the park, and developing a close friendship where they have shared memories of spending time together in the park.",
