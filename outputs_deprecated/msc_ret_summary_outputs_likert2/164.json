Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n2. Speaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks.\n3. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n4. Speaker B shared tips on repelling mosquitos using sprays with 20% DEET and other active ingredients.\n5. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities.\n6. Speaker B gets scared by bugs and creepy crawlies in the outdoors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It outlines past interactions where Speaker B shared tips about repelling mosquitoes, which ties directly to Speaker A mentioning loading up on repellent. It also informs that Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking, which aligns with Speaker A's current activity discussion. It provides relevant background about Speaker Aâ€™s plans for hiking and camping, which could be useful for generating a more informed response. However, the connection between MEMORY point 6, about Speaker B being scared of bugs, isn't directly tied to the current conversation, and some of the other points are more background than directly related to keeping the flow of the conversation. Therefore, it doesn't quite reach a perfect score of 5."
