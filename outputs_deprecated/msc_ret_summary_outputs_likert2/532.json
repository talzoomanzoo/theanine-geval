Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends? Speaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do. Speaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n3. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\n4. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n5. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet.\n6. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information about the ongoing discussion regarding an Alaskan trip, particularly focusing on outdoor activities and planning. However, there are several elements of the MEMORY that could be improved to increase its helpfulness:\n\n1. Sentence connections: The sentences in MEMORY are somewhat disjointed and do not clearly establish a connection or sequence of events that have happened in previous interactions. There is no clear development or natural progression from one point to another, which may limit how much the MEMORY aids in generating a coherent subsequent response.\n\n2. Specificity and Relevance: While the MEMORY mentions Speaker A's knowledge about outdoor activities in Alaska, it does not specifically mention sledding with dogs, which is a key point in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Including specific information about previously discussed activities like dog sledding would make the MEMORY more relevant and helpful.\n\n3. Causality: There is a lack of clear causality between the sentences, lacking connections like \"because,\" \"so,\" \"then,\" or other linking phrases that indicate why certain actions (like planning activities) are taking place.\n\nWhile potentially helpful, the MEMORY lacks the connections and specificity needed to be considered highly helpful for generating the next response for a language model."
