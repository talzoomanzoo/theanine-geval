Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends? Speaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\n2. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n3. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n4. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n6. Speaker A mentions that Alaska has mountains and glaciers, unsure if skiing is possible there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a fun idea! Yes, Alaska experiences the Midnight Sun during the summer months, so it will be daylight for most of the day. You'll have plenty of time to enjoy all the outdoor activities you have in mind.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives a general sense of the past interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B, specifically about their trip to Alaska and some considerations about activities and climatic conditions (e.g., hiking, cold and snowy conditions, ski possibilities). However, the details provided in the MEMORY are somewhat repetitive and do not provide a comprehensive view of causality or development of ideas related to Speaker B's interest in dog sledding or concerns about daylight hours. A slightly more enhanced MEMORY could include more on Speaker B's specific interests or queries, as well as Speaker A's responses regarding daylight conditions, which would be more directly helpful in generating follow-up responses in the given dialogue."
