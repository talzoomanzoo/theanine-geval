Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A's favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, saying \"for you I shall live\".\n2. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n3. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n4. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n5. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n6. Speaker B enjoys fishing and wishes their wife and sons could have joined them on the trip.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several pieces of relevant information that can aid in generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reveals the significance of tattoos to Speaker A, especially in relation to their family members, which is directly connected to the context of wanting a tattoo for their mom. Sentences 1, 2, and 3 provide insights into value and history behind Speaker A's tattoos and their personal connection to family, aligning with the context as Speaker A considers a tattoo for their mom. Sentence 4 introduces Speaker A's financial considerations that might play into their decision about getting a new tattoo. Sentence 5 indicates a familial connection to their workplace, adding indirect context that may affect their plans.\n\nHowever, Sentence 6 about Speaker B is unrelated to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and does not contribute useful information for generating a response. It's the only outlier that doesn't help explain Speaker A's perspective in the current discussion, which is why the score is not a 5. Overall, the MEMORY is mostly helpful and the sentences are naturally connected in a way that provides a clear backstory."
