Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has a government job that pays the bills but wishes they could work in interior design.\n2. Speaker B is not entirely satisfied with their job and wishes it was more rewarding.\n3. Speaker A finds job searching challenging and hopes to settle in the new city soon with a steady income.\n4. Speaker A is applying for a project coordinator role at a charity but aspires to become a project manager in the future.\n5. Speaker A has recently received a call for a job interview and is excited about it.\n6. Speaker B has two kids and enjoys painting and taking naps.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker B has a government job that they find unsatisfying and wishes to work in interior design (memory 1 and 2), which directly aligns with the topic of Speaker A's question about taking a chance on something more creative and fulfilling. Moreover, it mentions that Speaker B enjoys painting, hinting at another creative outlet beyond interior design (memory 6). However, the connection between these memories and their development is not strongly evident since their personal desires for change or how these activities (painting) could influence their decisions or aspirations to switch careers are less explored. Furthermore, most of the other memories revolve around Speaker Aâ€™s job aspirations (memory 3, 4, and 5) which are not directly relevant to the context where Speaker A is asking Speaker B about pursuing something creative. Therefore, while there is some helpful content, it lacks cohesion, making causality and relevancy not as clear as it could be."
