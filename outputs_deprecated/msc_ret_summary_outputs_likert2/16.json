Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim.  Speaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you  Speaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. Speaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you? Speaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has planned to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination.\n2. Speaker A has planned a cruise to the Caribbeans.\n3. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n4. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n6. Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and has signed up for several trips.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided is mostly helpful for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains relevant information about both speakers' interests and plans, which is naturally connected and useful in understanding their past conversations. For example, points 2 and 5 are directly reflected in their discussion about a cruise to the Caribbean. Similarly, point 3 is relevant as it mentions Speaker A's offer to teach Speaker B to swim, which aligns with Speaker B's interest. Point 1 and point 6 also support the conversation by indicating Speaker A's interest in activities during the cruise. However, point 4 could be slightly misleading since it implies that Speaker B wants to listen to punk music specifically while swimming and programming, which wasn't directly expressed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, though it does tie into their mutual interest in punk music. Overall, the MEMORY provides a coherent narrative that aids in understanding and forecasting the context of their relationship and conversations."
