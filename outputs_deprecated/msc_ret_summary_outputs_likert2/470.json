Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer? Speaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to? Speaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors? Speaker B: Yes. That way they could have a fireworks show too. I love fireworks. Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle? Speaker A: No, but I have been to Disney World in Florida.  I love fireworks too.  I want to get married on the 4th of July.  That was we will have a national holiday and fireworks for us every year!  It sounds like you've been to Disneyland? Speaker B: No, but I thought you might have since you lived in LA for awhile. Did you get to see any live Disney music performances while you were at Disney World? Speaker A: No, we rode a lot of rides that broke down.  We had to be rescued from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.  It was stuck.  Someone put on waders and pushed us to the side to climb out.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A loves Disney music.\n2. Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods.\n3. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo.\n4. Speaker A used to live in Los Angeles.\n5. Speaker B is waiting for bands to announce their summer tour schedule to plan which shows to attend.\n6. Speaker A plans to do lots of shopping during their trip.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A's previous residence in Los Angeles and an interest in music concerts. However, the details about enjoying museums, trying different foods, and planning a trip to Sao Paulo or lots of shopping do not directly connect or contribute to the development of the current conversation topics, such as the discussion of concerts, fireworks, and Disney experiences. The memory lacks specificity related to the main points of interest in the dialogue, such as fireworks, specific concert experiences involving fireworks, or Disney music performances. Overall, MEMORY could better aid in generating a relevant next response by incorporating more directly connected and causally relevant details."
