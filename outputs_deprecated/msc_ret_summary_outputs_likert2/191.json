Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A. Speaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now? Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done.  Speaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on? Speaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n2. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n3. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n4. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n5. Speaker A wishes to get better grades and is hopeful for a soccer scholarship.\n6. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context regarding both Speaker A and Speaker B, but lacks a strong connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It does indicate that Speaker A struggles with history and maintaining good grades (point 1 and 2), which can be relevant since they are discussing exams and school performance. However, the MEMORY contains information about sports medicine, soccer scholarships, and Speaker B's mother which is not relevant in the current dialogue context, where the conversation is centered around finals and studying strategies. The MEMORY hints that Speaker A may need support with their studies, and Speaker B understands the pressure of maintaining grades, which is applicable to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, not all of the MEMORY points directly contribute to generating the next response, leading to a middling score."
