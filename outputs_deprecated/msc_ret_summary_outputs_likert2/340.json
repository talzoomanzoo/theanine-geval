Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that? Speaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has a son and enjoys reading books, particularly about animals.\n2. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n3. Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys watching movies with them.\n4. Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.\n5. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n6. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several relevant pieces of information that could help Speaker A generate a proper response in the dialogue context. Specifically, it contains sentences 1 and 2, which reveal that Speaker B enjoys reading about animals and has a son. This aligns with Speaker B's comment in the dialogue context about preferring animal books, reinforcing the consistent theme of Speaker B's interests. Sentences 3, 4, 5, and 6 provide context about Speaker A's interest in books, movies, and grandchildren, which ties back to their shared interest in reading and leisure activities after spending time with grandchildren. The memory is structured in a way that showcases these connections and past interactions, making it helpful for understanding the current conversation and supporting a relevant continuation in dialogue. However, some sentences are more indirectly connected to the ongoing context, such as those about the number of grandchildren or Netflix, hence a score of 4 rather than 5."
