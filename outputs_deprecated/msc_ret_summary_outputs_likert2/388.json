Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a number of relevant details that can be used to generate a meaningful response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It informs us that Speaker A enjoys martial arts and is active in that area, which aligns with Speaker A's enthusiasm for their martial arts class in the dialogue. Memory elements 1 and 2 connect to Speaker A's interest in martial arts, while element 5 offers insight into Speaker A's professional and academic background, which enriches the discussion about classes and activities. Memory elements 3 and 4 establish a common interest between Speaker A and Speaker B in martial arts, offering potential avenues for conversation. While there is some redundancy and not all details are perfectly interconnected, the overall memory provides helpful information for continuing the conversation naturally."
