Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys watching movies with them.\n2. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n3. Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.\n4. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n5. Speaker A enjoys watching Jeopardy with their grandchildren and cooking for them, with the busiest time being the weekend.\n6. Speaker B has a son and enjoys reading books, particularly about animals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great way to relax. I've been reading a lot of animal-related books lately, but a good crime drama sounds intriguing.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant pieces of information about Speaker A's grandchildren and their interest in reading books, which can be linked to the context where Speaker A talks about not watching their grandkids and enjoying a new book. However, most of the MEMORY is about Speaker A's interactions with their grandchildren, which isn't very useful for generating a next response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where the focus is more on the book. Additionally, Speaker B's memory line about enjoying books, although slightly relevant, does not sufficiently contribute to the development of the conversation about the crime drama book or further interactions. The relevance and causality between the MEMORY and DIALOGUE CONTEXT could be more clearly demonstrated."
