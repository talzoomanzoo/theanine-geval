Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B shared tips on repelling mosquitos using sprays with 20% DEET and other active ingredients.\n2. Speaker B gets scared by bugs and creepy crawlies in the outdoors.\n3. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n4. Speaker A is a personal trainer who loves camping in remote areas.\n5. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n6. Speaker B dislikes bugs and is not a fan of camping, hiking, or the outdoors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! It's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to those pesky bugs. I hope the repellent works well for you on your camping trips.",
    "prediction": "**Helpfulness Score: 4**\n\nThe MEMORY offers useful context for Speaker B’s dialogue generation. It provides pertinent information regarding the past interactions of Speakers A and B relevant to the current conversation about repelling mosquitoes. Specifically, statement 1 directly connects with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as it mentions Speaker B sharing mosquito repellent tips, which informs Speaker A's response. Furthermore, statements 2 and 6 reveal Speaker B’s apprehension and dislike for insects and outdoor activities, aligning with Speaker A's proactive approach to mosquito protection. Details such as Speaker A being a personal trainer who enjoys camping (Statements 3 and 4) add context for the conversation's backdrop but are less directly linked to aid immediate response generation. The sentences are generally well-connected; however, the varying topics related to practices and preferences regarding the outdoors could be presented more cohesively to fully demonstrate the causality of events. That's why I rated it a 4 instead of a 5."
