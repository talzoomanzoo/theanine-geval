Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok?  Speaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish? Speaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus! Speaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well? Speaker A: Yes, I am thinking about trying either the new eclairs, or their tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle! I have too many good options to pick from! What one would you pick? Speaker B: Hands down, I would pick the tres leches. Ever since I tried it a few years ago, it has always been my favorite dessert.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n2. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n3. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n4. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n5. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n6. Speaker A's restaurant plays a mix of songs, mainly easy listening, to create a relaxing environment for diners.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that can be useful in generating a response in the context of the conversation. Information from points 1 and 4 can be connected to the dialogue context as they describe Speaker A's experience and benefits of working at a restaurant, which ties to Speaker A's excitement about trying the new dish. Furthermore, these points help paint a picture of Speaker A's work life and their relationship with food at the workplace.\n\nHowever, not all the sentences are directly relevant to the immediate conversation. For instance, points 2, 5, and 6 provide extraneous details that don't immediately connect to the current dialogue on the new dish and desserts. Additionally, point 3 is repetitive and doesn't add new information from point 4. The causality and relevancy of events aren't always clearly demonstrated across all points.\n\nThis combination of useful and less useful information justifies a score of 3, as the MEMORY contains partial help for generating a relevant continuation of the conversation. To score higher, the MEMORY would need to include more directly relevant information and demonstrate clear connections between events mentioned within the context."
