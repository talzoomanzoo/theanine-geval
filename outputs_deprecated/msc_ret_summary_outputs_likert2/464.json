Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is waiting for bands to announce their summer tour schedule to plan which shows to attend.\n2. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo.\n3. Speaker A and their boyfriend also look forward to having some refreshing beers by the beach.\n4. Speaker A plans to do lots of shopping during their trip.\n5. Speaker B enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food and live music.\n6. Speaker B has seen Three Dog Night in concert and enjoys their live shows.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides minimal relevant information for generating a next response. Speaker B's interest in music and enjoyment of live shows (point 1 and 6) are slightly relevant but not directly connected to planning Speaker B's concert schedule mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The other information regarding Speaker A's trip plans and lifestyle preferences is not directly related to the question asked about Speaker B's concert plans, thus not aiding in generating a more precise future response. The MEMORY is a bit disjointed because it focuses more on Speaker A's activities than Speaker B's concert-related plans."
