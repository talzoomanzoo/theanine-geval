Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing?

    "raw_prediction": "I don't have any trips planned at the moment, but I would love to visit Greece for the history and Greek mythology. Maybe we can plan a trip together in the future!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides considerable helpful information linked to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clearly highlights Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology and their desire to visit Greece, which corresponds to the ongoing conversation about these topics. Additionally, it tells us that Speaker B has visited Italy before and enjoyed the cuisine, which is relevant and could be brought up in the current or future dialogues about Italy and travel plans. The memory also notes Speaker A's plans for Italy in Spring with friends and their interest in history and architecture, which connects well to the context where Speaker A discusses their upcoming Italy trip. The memory is structured such that there is a clear understanding of the shared interests and past events (e.g., past visit to Italy, working on Greek mythology, etc.) which adds a natural flow and context to the ongoing dialogue. However, it includes some information that may not be immediately relevant to the current dialogue, such as Speaker A having a daughter, which detracts slightly from achieving a perfect score."
