Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week? Speaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you? Speaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions? Speaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like? Speaker A: I like all kinds of games. I like party, fighting, RPGs, shooters, action, adventure, and puzzle games. I enjoy playing Jurassic Park: World but I'd like to find another game to play. The storm means I'll be inside for a bit, so I think I'll curl up with some pizza and just zone out. Do you like to do anything else besides game when it's rainy? Speaker B: Well, I might help around the house with cleaning or laundry, but not that much. Mostly gaming. If I feel I sat too long, I'll switch to Nintendo Switch's Ring Fit Adventure to get my body moving a bit. Do yo know that game? Speaker A: I've heard of it. I think I need to get some exercise, so that might be a good idea. I'd like to stay in shape as much as I can. I guess games are the best way to do that! That's a good suggestion. How about you? Do you only like games like RE? What other genres do you like? Speaker B: I like fighting too, but not RPG types. I tried racing games before, but clearly not good at it so I'm not enjoying them that much.  Speaker A: Maybe when you get the chance, we should play an online game together. I'm not a competitive person. I mainly play games for fun and I don't care if I win or lose. What do you think? Speaker B: Sure! Do you have any suggestion for the game? I also not that competitive, which probably is the reason why I don't enjoy RPG types that much with all their groups and clans and ranks. I always thought RPG players are all these serious gamers. Speaker A: Maybe we can a play fighting game like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. It's a good way to pass the time. I've always wanted to learn martial arts myself. Ha!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy playing video games in their free time.\n3. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n4. Speaker A does not play video games often but may consider trying them.\n5. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n6.

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! I'm up for some Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. It'll be fun to play together and maybe I can teach you a move or two. Let's plan a gaming session soon!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, which aligns with the context's conclusion where Speaker A suggests playing a fighting game like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat with Speaker B. Additionally, it notes Speaker B's enjoyment of video games, specifically mentioning League of Legends and Resident Evil, which is relevant as Speaker B discussed their gaming preferences, including Resident Evil, in the context. However, MEMORY lacks detailed connections or causal information about the development of Speaker A and Speaker B's interactions. Some information, like Speaker A's hesitance to try Resident Evil, is repeated but doesn't enhance generating a next response. There is room for better integration and reflection of the ongoing dialogue, resulting in a middling score."
