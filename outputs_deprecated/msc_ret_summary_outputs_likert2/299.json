Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week? Speaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you? Speaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions? Speaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like? Speaker A: I like all kinds of games. I like party, fighting, RPGs, shooters, action, adventure, and puzzle games. I enjoy playing Jurassic Park: World but I'd like to find another game to play. The storm means I'll be inside for a bit, so I think I'll curl up with some pizza and just zone out. Do you like to do anything else besides game when it's rainy? Speaker B: Well, I might help around the house with cleaning or laundry, but not that much. Mostly gaming. If I feel I sat too long, I'll switch to Nintendo Switch's Ring Fit Adventure to get my body moving a bit. Do yo know that game? Speaker A: I've heard of it. I think I need to get some exercise, so that might be a good idea. I'd like to stay in shape as much as I can. I guess games are the best way to do that! That's a good suggestion. How about you? Do you only like games like RE? What other genres do you like? Speaker B: I like fighting too, but not RPG types. I tried racing games before, but clearly not good at it so I'm not enjoying them that much.  Speaker A: Maybe when you get the chance, we should play an online game together. I'm not a competitive person. I mainly play games for fun and I don't care if I win or lose. What do you think?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n2. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy playing video games in their free time.\n4. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n5. Speaker A does not play video games often but may consider trying them.\n6. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! I'm always up for playing games online with friends, even if it's just for fun. Let me know when you're ready to play together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reflects that both speakers enjoy playing video games in their free time and mentions specific games they have played or are hesitant to play, like Resident Evil and Jurassic Park: World. It also indicates that Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, which aligns with the suggestion in the dialogue context about playing an online game together. However, the MEMORY lacks detailed information on other aspects of the dialogue, such as discussions around game preferences, fitness games, or activities during rainy days. Additionally, while there is some logical flow in the MEMORY (e.g., shared interest in games, specific game titles mentioned), it is not as naturally connected or causally demonstrated as it could be. More specific connections and continuity between the speakers' past interactions and preferences could have been included to make the MEMORY more helpful."
