Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company?

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful for generating a response. Specifically, it gives context about Speaker A's interests and career considerations, which could relate to how Speaker B responds to the conversation about jobs. However, some parts of the MEMORY seem disconnected from the immediate dialogue context, such as Speaker A's interest in ice cream and books, and Speaker B's inability to change careers isn't directly relevant to the current conversation. Moreover, the MEMORY doesn't fully capture the development of the conversation or the specifics of the job discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, while there is some helpful content, it is not consistently connected or relevant for a high score."
