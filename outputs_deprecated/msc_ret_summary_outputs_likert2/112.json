Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position.  Speaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it? Speaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days.  Speaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A enjoys playing soccer but is not into music.\n3. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n4. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n5. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n6. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That would be so cool! You definitely have the knowledge and passion for it. Plus, your goal-scoring skills would make for some exciting commentary!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information, such as Speaker B's college soccer experience and their fan allegiance to Manchester United, which could be leveraged in continuing the conversation about soccer games or shared interests in watching matches. It also mentions Speaker A's current involvement in soccer, being a striker, and upcoming games, which provides context about their passion for soccer. However, despite containing related information, the MEMORY lacks a clear connection or causality to the specific aspects of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the conversation around becoming a voice on soccer video games. The MEMORY sentences are somewhat disconnected, making it less helpful than it could be if more naturally structured around the ongoing dialogue."
