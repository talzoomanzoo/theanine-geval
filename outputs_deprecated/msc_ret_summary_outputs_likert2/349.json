Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin! Speaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name?  Speaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls!  Speaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n2. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n3. Speaker A has a kitten from their cat and enjoys taking them on trips.\n4. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted and humorous conversation about their pets and travels.\n6. Speaker A usually leaves their cats with a friend while traveling.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "They are doing great, thank you for asking! Pumpkin and Ginger are getting along surprisingly well, considering Ginger's usual attitude towards new cats. It's quite entertaining to watch them interact.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for Speaker A, representing their interests, interactions, and dynamics with Speaker B. It clarifies Speaker A's fondness for cats and aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly the choice of names for the kitten, Ginger, and the new kitten, Pumpkin. It also reveals Speaker B's stance on cats, and the humorous and light-hearted nature of their conversations about pets and travels. However, some details, such as the mention of Subaru and traveling with pets, do not directly contribute to the current topic of conversationâ€”naming the kitten, making the MEMORY slightly less tied to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, the information in MEMORY is highly relevant and connects naturally with the dialogue through humor and common themes surrounding pets."
