Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing?

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you for asking about my daughter. She's doing well, thank you. I'm glad to hear that your Greek mythology study is going well. Greece sounds like an amazing place to visit, especially with your interest in Greek mythology. I hope you get to visit the Greek islands soon!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that could aid Speaker A in generating a response. From the MEMORY, we learn that Speaker B has an interest in Greek mythology, and Speaker A shares an interest in history but more so towards the Italian architecture. Additionally, there is the context that Speaker A's daughter is mentioned, which may relate to teaching love for mythology. The MEMORY also indicates that Speaker B has traveled to Italy and enjoyed it, which could relate back to traveling abroad and studying history from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY lacks strong connectivity or causal background between these memories at a deeper level, and some elements, such as planning a trip to Greece or talking more about Poseidon, might not be directly tied to the upcoming response, resulting in a moderate level of helpfulness rather than high."
