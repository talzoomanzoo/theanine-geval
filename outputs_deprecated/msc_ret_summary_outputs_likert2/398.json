Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n2. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n3. Speaker B suggests making enough barbeque for leftovers on nights when grilling is not possible, due to time or energy constraints.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy barbecuing and have a love for pets.\n5. Speaker B plans to bring a new marinade and a six pack of beer for the gathering.\n6. Speaker B plans to grill steaks this weekend and prefers using an old charcoal grill over a gas one.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds awesome! I'll definitely look forward to hearing you play. It'll add a nice touch to our evening of grilling and good company.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for Speaker B to generate a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains several naturally connected sentences that outline past interactions and shared interests between Speaker A and Speaker B. The MEMORY informs us that Speaker A is interested in grilling and is enthusiastic about spending time outdoors, which is directly relevant to the proposed barbecue. Additionally, it mentions past invitations, shared enjoyment of barbecuing, and specific preparations for the gathering, such as bringing marinade and beer. The connection and causality of their interactions are clearly demonstrated, making MEMORY highly useful for generating a contextually appropriate response."
