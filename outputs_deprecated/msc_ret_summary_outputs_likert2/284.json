Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar. Speaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general? Speaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts. Speaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition.\n2. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n3. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n4. Speaker B does not do a lot of cooking or baking but is interested in learning.\n5. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n6. Speaker A is eating their favorite jello.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about the past interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B. It mentions Speaker A's family tradition of making jello with their grandmother, which is connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B teaches their kids to make jello. It shows a shared interest in family traditions centered around jello. However, the MEMORY does not contain information directly addressing the recent shift in the conversation towards baking, sugar consumption, and Speaker B's efforts to lay off desserts. The MEMORY also includes extraneous details, like Speaker A eating their favorite jello, which are less useful for generating a response to Speaker B's current concerns. Therefore, while there is some helpfulness regarding the context of jello, it's not comprehensive or fully aligned with the latest conversation topics."
