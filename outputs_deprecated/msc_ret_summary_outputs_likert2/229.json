Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n4. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n5. Speaker A plays the clarinet in a band concert and has a solar investment for their office building.\n6. Speaker B is focused on developing renewable energy sources for their inventions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains details that could be helpful for Speaker B to generate a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but not all entries are directly related to the topic of gardening. \n\n1. The first memory about Speaker A struggles with gardening and finding space plants intriguing connects with the context and adds depth. It gives Speaker B insight into Speaker A's interest and struggles, which can lead to more informed suggestions.\n\n2. The second memory, detailing Speaker B's knowledge and experience in gardening, is directly relevant as it establishes Speaker B's credibility, which is helpful for making recommendations.\n\n3. The third memory about weight gain and planning to work more in the garden is somewhat related as it could lead to more discussion about gardening practices.\n\n4. The fourth memory with Speaker A's joke about space weeds also touches on gardening and shows Speaker A's humor, but is less directly helpful for actual suggestions.\n\n5. The fifth and sixth memories are less relevant to the direct topic of garden creation, focusing instead on other aspects of Speaker A and B's lives, like music, solar investments, and renewable energy, thus providing little helpfulness for the current context.\n\nOverall, while some of these memories can enhance the conversation and help in making gardening suggestions, others are tangentially connected or irrelevant to the specific topic at hand."
