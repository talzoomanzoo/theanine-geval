Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim.  Speaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you  Speaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. Speaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you? Speaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it. Speaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car? Speaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming. Speaker A: That would be great too. I like to program in several different languages. Do you have a preference? Speaker B: No, I'm just getting started so I don't have a preference. Maybe you could show me what you prefer and we could start there.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n2. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n4. Speaker A has planned to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination.\n5. Speaker A has planned a cruise to the Caribbeans.\n6. Speaker B is interested in learning programming and is already practicing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Sure, I can definitely show you some different programming languages and see which one you like best. It's always good to explore different options in the beginning stages.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains useful and relevant information about the past interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B that can help generate a natural and coherent response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. It accurately captures Speaker A's offer to teach swimming and programming, which is directly mentioned in the dialogue (\"I can teach you!\"), indicating a history of helpfulness.\n2. The MEMORY details the conversation about cruising and programming, which ties back into the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions cruising and programming (\"I'm excited about going to the Carribean,\" \"I like to program in several different languages\").\n3. It correctly identifies that Speaker B is new to programming and open to learning different languages, which aligns with Speaker A's query in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n4. The memory about snorkelling and cruise activities isn't mentioned in the current context, suggesting room for improvement by focusing on more immediate relevancies such as preferences in music during programming.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY largely aligns with the relevant discussion points, though some parts like the activities planned on the cruise are less directly tied to the present dialogue context. Therefore, a 4 is appropriate as it effectively represents relationships and context but includes slightly less necessary or prominent information from the conversation."
