Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me? Speaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week? Speaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day Speaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through Speaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n2. Speaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights.\n3. Speaker B found flights that work for their schedule and price and will be visiting Speaker A in a couple of weeks.\n4. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\n5. Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n6. Speaker A has visited Alaska and describes it as beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights that Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit, mentions the idea of attending folk concerts which relates to the conversation about concerts, and indicates that Speaker B is interested in visiting and attending concerts. However, the MEMORY includes some additional information that is not directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as tours or outdoor activities, which are not discussed in the context provided. The MEMORY also lacks clarity on the specific connection between events and could be better structured to enhance natural progression from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT to the MEMORY. While there is some helpful information, the sentences are not entirely focused or seamlessly connected to the given context."
