Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A. Speaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n2. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n3. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n4. Speaker B is on their way to college and studying sports medicine.\n5. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n6. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides moderately helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights that Speaker B is focused on sports medicine, which ties into their discussion about exams and finals season. This contextual background can help inform Speaker A's next conversational step, potentially relating to how they are both managing their studies. Additionally, Speaker A's struggle with history and grades is relevant since they just discussed how they fared in their history exam. The MEMORY effectively outlines these ongoing academic challenges and aspirations, which could influence the dialogue's direction. However, the clarity of causality and development could be improved by explicitly tying these academic pressures to their current conversation."
