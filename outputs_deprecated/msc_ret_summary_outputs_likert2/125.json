Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't been to Europe yet, but it's definitely on my bucket list. I've heard the beaches there are beautiful too. Hopefully, I can combine my love for sports medicine and traveling in the future.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding internships and the mention of the medical field. It also includes Speaker B's interest in sports medicine and their search for internships. However, some parts of the MEMORY are inaccurate or irrelevant to the dialogue, such as the suggestion that Speaker A enjoys hiking along the coast and collecting shells, which isn't mentioned in the context. Additionally, the suggestion that surfing could be a way for Speaker B to make connections in the medical field is somewhat vague and not presented as part of the original conversation. Thus, while there is helpful information related to the conversation, the MEMORY could be better structured to clearly demonstrate causality and relevancy."
