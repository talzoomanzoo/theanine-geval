Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week? Speaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n2. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n3. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n4. Speaker B plays Resident Evil VIII alone in the dark to make it scarier.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy playing video games in their free time.\n6. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker B enjoys video games, specifically mentioning Resident Evil VIII, which is directly relevant to the context. Additionally, it gives context to Speaker A and Speaker B's past interactions related to gaming, indicating a shared interest. Speaker B's enjoyment of playing video games and tips for Resident Evil provides a background for their current gaming activity. However, while the memory's pieces are somewhat well-organized, a stronger connection and causality could have been made between the sentences, especially regarding Speaker A's reluctance to try Resident Evil. Overall, it is relevant and connects past interactions to the current context reasonably well."
