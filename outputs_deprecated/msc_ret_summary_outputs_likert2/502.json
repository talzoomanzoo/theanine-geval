    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music. Speaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band? Speaker B: I'm big fan of aerosmith. When do you learn music. Whom teach you? Speaker A: aerosmith are great, have you ever seen them live? I have been playing drums since i was a kid, my father taught me when I was young and from then on I just taught myself Speaker B: That's awesome! I have been trying to learn last one year. Still I didn't get right teacher. I'm jealous on you. I don't have like your dad.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician.\n2. Speaker B is willing to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook.\n3. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend.\n4. Speaker A was good at writing in school, while Speaker B was bad at math and preferred fishing.\n5. Speaker A wants to see Sublime live one day but doesn't go to many concerts other than the ones their band plays in.\n6. Speaker A is part of a band that tours different countries for their music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains multiple points about Speaker A that could potentially be relevant to the conversation, such as their involvement in a band and playing drums. However, several other points (e.g., teaching Speaker A to fish and cook, or the specifics about Sublime and concert attendance) are not directly relevant or contextually connected to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Speaker A's musical background is discussed more broadly. Furthermore, the structure does not clearly demonstrate causality or the natural flow of past interactions between the speakers. As such, the helpfulness of this MEMORY in generating a proper next response is limited."
