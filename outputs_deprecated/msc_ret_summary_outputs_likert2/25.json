Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok?  Speaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish? Speaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus! Speaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n2. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n3. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n4. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n5. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n6. Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I wish I could, but unfortunately, the free meals don't include dessert. But I do get to take home any leftover baked goods, so I always have a sweet treat waiting for me after my shifts.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, knowing that Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week (Memory 1) is directly relevant to the context, as Speaker A mentions trying a new dish for free. Memory 3 and 4 reinforce Speaker A's feelings about their job, which might explain why they're so enthusiastic about new dishes. \n\nHowever, several details in the MEMORY are not directly relevant or necessary for generating a response in this specific dialogue context, such as Speaker A's specific work schedule or the fact that Speaker A invited Speaker B to the restaurant (unless this becomes relevant in future dialogues). Sentence connections are somewhat redundant, particularly Memory 3 and 4 which essentially convey the same sentiment. Additionally, Memory 5 about Speaker B's preferences doesn't contribute to the ongoing conversation about the dish.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides some helpful context but lacks precision and could be improved by focusing more on relevant details and reducing redundancy."
