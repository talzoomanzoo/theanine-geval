Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation. Speaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon? Speaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences.\n3. Speaker A enjoyed the movie \"Coming to America\" and expressed interest in watching its sequel.\n4. Speaker A relies on Speaker B for movie suggestions, mentioning a preference for comedies.\n5.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY does contain some helpful information for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it reinforces that Speaker A relies on Speaker B for movie recommendations (points 2 and 4) and is currently interested in movies related to \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Coming to America.\" It also confirms Speaker B's role as a movie aficionado (points 2 and 6) who has recommended \"Coming 2 America\" (point 5), which aligns with the context where A plans to watch \"Coming to America.\" \n\nHowever, the MEMORY is somewhat unfocused. The mention of Uma Thurman (point 1) and Speaker A's taste for comedies (point 4) are not directly relevant to the immediate next response. Also, the inclusion of Speaker B's diverse movie preferences (point 6) doesn't directly aid in crafting a response related to \"Coming to America\" or its sequel. A more concise MEMORY focused on the immediate movie-related exchange between the speakers would be more helpful."
