Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't!

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information regarding Speaker B's background in karate and lifeguarding, which directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A and B are planning a visit to the dojo and discussing martial arts. However, not all sentences are directly useful for generating the next response in the current dialogue. For example, details about Speaker B's interest in IT work or attending football games, and Speaker A's marketing studies aren't directly relevant to the immediate conversation about martial arts classes and the planned meeting. While these aspects of MEMORY offer some depth to the characters, they don't contribute to the development of the dialogue with respect to the current context. Additionally, the connections between the details aren't fully articulated, limiting the usefulness of the MEMORY in driving the conversation forward."
