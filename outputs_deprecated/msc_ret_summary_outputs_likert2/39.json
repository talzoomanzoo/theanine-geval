Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes? Speaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try?

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information regarding the interests and background of Speaker B, which could be useful in generating a natural and contextually appropriate response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, knowing that Speaker B has a background in karate (green belt level), football, and is contemplating IT studies gives an understanding of their interests, which can help in crafting a response that resonates with their experiences and preferences. Additionally, the fact that Speaker A has an interest in marketing and shares a common interest in learning languages with Speaker B provides some context for their personalities and potential topics for further interactions.\n\nHowever, the memory lacks a strong causal or directly relevant connection to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the information is useful and adds depth to the characters, it does not directly inform the current conversation about martial arts classes or scheduling a visit to the dojo. There is also some repetition and overlap in the details provided, which could be more cohesively stated. Hence, while the MEMORY is somewhat helpful, it does not completely align with or enhance the immediate context of the dialogue."
