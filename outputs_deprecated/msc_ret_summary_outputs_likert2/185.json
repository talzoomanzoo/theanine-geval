Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n2. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n3. Speaker B is on their way to college and studying sports medicine.\n4. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n5. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n6. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for Speaker B's response. It establishes Speaker B's strong background and ongoing interest in sports medicine (points 1, 2, and 3), which links to the exam mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This information is relevant for Speaker B when discussing how the exam went. Additionally, the MEMORY highlights Speaker B's internal pressure to succeed due to their mother's position at the school (point 5), offering insight into their emotional state and potentially affecting their discussion of the exam's outcome. The connection between the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is natural, with clear relevancy and causal relationships established between Speaker B's academic focus and their responses to questions about exams."
