Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me? Speaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week? Speaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day Speaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through Speaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested. Speaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n2. Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n3. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\n4. Speaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights.\n5. Speaker B found flights that work for their schedule and price and will be visiting Speaker A in a couple of weeks.\n6. Speaker A has visited Alaska and describes it as beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "You definitely won't need to rent a car while you're here. Anchorage is very walkable and bike-friendly in the summer! And don't worry, the snow is mostly gone by then. It's a beautiful time to explore the city on foot or bike.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides comprehensive information relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes plans about Speaker B visiting Speaker A, with mentions of concerts, tours, and outdoor activities, which aligns with the ongoing conversation regarding the visit and potential activities like concerts. The context of prices for flights is also relevant, as is in the context's discussion. What it misses are specific mentions of weather conditions or the need for transportation that B asked about, which could be helpful for completing the conversational flow. The MEMORY is mostly connected and provides a helpful recap of past discussions, but could be improved by touching on the latest queries or concerns expressed directly in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
