Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work? Speaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol Speaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise?  Speaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows. Speaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity.  Speaker B: Yes, I agree. What kind of hours would this new job have?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker A is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock.\n3. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n4. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking, mentioning setting up a hammock at their campsite.\n5. Speaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning to go hiking together this weekend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It's mostly evening shifts, which is perfect for me since I love watching the sunset while camping. But I'll definitely need to figure out how to balance work and hiking trips like the one we have planned this weekend.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some contextually relevant information that could aid in generating a coherent next response. For example, it affirms Speaker A's interest in camping and hiking, which aligns with Speaker B's interest in the park system and guiding (MEMORY points 1 and 4). Also, it provides information about Speaker A's characteristics like being shy and a recent high school graduate, which adds depth to the conversation but doesn't directly influence the flow of the current context (MEMORY points 2 and 3).\n\nHowever, certain aspects within the MEMORY are less relevant or not directly connected with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, the specific details about Speaker A's search for camping gear, in this context, are unnecessary (MEMORY point 2). Additionally, Speaker B's inclination towards camping, hiking, kindness, and equality (MEMORY point 5), although informative, doesn't directly interact with the current dialogue progression. Lastly, the plan of going hiking together (MEMORY point 6) is a potential future event but isn't essential for the current dialogue.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY provides some useful information, not all elements are tightly connected to the current dialogue context in a manner that adds significant value to the generation of a relevant next response."
