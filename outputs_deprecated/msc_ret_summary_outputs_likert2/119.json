Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!\n\nMEMORY:\n1.

Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n3. Speaker B's professors have been supportive in writing letters for an internship application.\n4. Speaker B is studying sports medicine and plays soccer, looking to join their college team in the future.\n5. Speaker B is struggling with finding internships and feels like they are at a disadvantage compared to others with connections.\n6. Speaker A is interested in getting tips from locals and knows someone named John who could help.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's awesome, thank you so much for the offer! I'll definitely reach out to them and see if they have any opportunities available. Having connections in the field can really make a difference in finding the right internship.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful and relevant information for generating the next response in the dialogue. It gives context about Speaker B's interest in sports medicine and their active search for internships, which aligns with the opportunity mentioned by Speaker A in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The information about Speaker B seeking letters of recommendation from professors also adds depth to their commitment to the field, and their feeling of being at a disadvantage highlights the significance of the opportunity presented by Speaker A. The MEMORY also describes supportive interactions from both Speaker A and Speaker B's professors, indicating a network of encouragement, which is relevant to the topic of internships. The detail about Speaker B playing soccer and wishing to join a college team, while connected to sports, is a little less directly relevant, and the mention of Speaker A knowing someone named John seems unrelated to the particular conversation about internships. Overall, the MEMORY aligns well with the dialogue's topic and provides a supportive backdrop but could benefit from tighter connections in some parts to achieve a perfect score."
