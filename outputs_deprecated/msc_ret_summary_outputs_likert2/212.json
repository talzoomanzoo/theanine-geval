Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice.  Speaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with? Speaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think? Speaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point. Speaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.   Speaker B: I didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n2. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n3. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n4. Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes.\n5. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n6. Speaker A has given a pressure cooker as a gift and uses it for recipes like lamb shanks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Cooking the rice beforehand and letting it cool actually helps to prevent it from becoming sticky when fried. It's a great tip for achieving that perfect fried rice texture.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant context that contributes to generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It indicates Speaker B's interest in learning to cook with a pressure cooker, which aligns with the conversation about finding recipes and cooking suggestions. Additionally, it highlights that Speaker B's husband enjoys Asian food, adding context to Speaker B's receptiveness to the shrimp fried rice suggestion. The MEMORY also includes Speaker A's experience and recommendations regarding pressure cookers, which can be helpful in explaining why cooking the rice a day before could enhance the dish. The natural connections between the sentences in MEMORY create a coherent background that enriches the dialogue. However, more detailed information about specific recipes or techniques could have provided even greater relevance, resulting in a perfect score."
