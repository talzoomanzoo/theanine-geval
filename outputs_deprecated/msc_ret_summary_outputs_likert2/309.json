Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? Speaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month Speaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation? Speaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there! Speaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo? Speaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people. Speaker A: That sounds awesome.  I haven't been to the zoo in so long.  I wish I could go. Speaker B: You should go with your sister! she can bring her dog. They probably have all kinds of exotic birds...\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys seeing pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister.\n2. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n3. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds.\n4. Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they go to the zoo every few weeks.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo.\n6. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful for generating a next response in the dialogue context. It mentions Speaker B considering adopting a kitten, which aligns with the ongoing conversation about Speaker A's friend's kittens. Additionally, Memory sentences 3 and 5 mention Speaker A's enjoyment of visiting the zoo and seeing exotic birds, which ties into Speaker B's plans to visit the San Diego Zoo. However, the connections and relevancy between events could be clearer. For instance, sentence 4 about Speaker B's girlfriend going to the zoo doesn't seem directly relevant to the current dialogue, neither does their discussion on hobbies like gardening. Some more specific details connecting the current discussion about the San Diego Zoo or potential interested in kittens/cats from previous interactions would enhance the relevance and continuity."
