Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing? Speaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n2.

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a hilarious and adorable portrait idea! As for the new cat, I'm thinking about adopting from a local shelter. I've heard they have some really sweet kittens looking for a home.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides a rich context that is highly relevant and helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains direct references to Speaker A and B's interests and ongoing activities. For instance, it mentions that Speaker B is a painter working on a portrait for Speaker A, and that Speaker B has an interesting mix of pets, which aligns with the ongoing conversation about painting pets. Additionally, MEMORY captures Speaker A's thoughts about getting kittens and their perspective on rats, which could feed into the conversation about pets. The connections are clearly demonstrated, especially Speaker B's relationship with painting and pets. The MEMORY ties into the current topic and provides a strong foundation for Speaker A to continue the dialogue naturally and relevantly."
