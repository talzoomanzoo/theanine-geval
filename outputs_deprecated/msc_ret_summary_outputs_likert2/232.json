Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you. Speaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them Speaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued.  Speaker B: Well if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n4. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n5. Speaker A plays the clarinet in a band concert and has a solar investment for their office building.\n6. Speaker B is also interested in space exploration and plant science, expressing concerns about the fuels used for space travel.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I never thought about having a tree indoors, but it could definitely add a unique touch to my garden project. Thanks for the suggestion, I'll look into it!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model representing Speaker A to generate a proper next response. The memory indicates that Speaker A struggles with gardening but is intrigued by unique ideas such as space plants, which aligns with the conversation about creating a garden at home. Additionally, it suggests that Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants, supporting their suggestions in the dialogue. Furthermore, Speaker A's interest in space aligns with their previous joke about space weeds, providing continuity in their character's interests. The memory also hints at a more profound interest both speakers have in exploration and science, which could guide the conversation to broader topics. However, some memory details, like Speaker A's clarinet playing and solar investment, are less directly connected to the present conversation. While those may contribute to character depth, they are not as immediately relevant to the garden-focused dialogue, preventing a full score of 5."
