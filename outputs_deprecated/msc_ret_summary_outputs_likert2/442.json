Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B believes that luxurious items distract from the value of their family.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n3. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n4. Speaker A used to live in a suburb of DC and misses the convenience of city life.\n5. Speaker B is open to moving to the country to be further away from neighbors.\n6. Speaker A works on a family farm and will be using the new truck for farm work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some information about Speaker A and Speaker B's past conversations and preferences, but most of the details are not directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT of Speaker A buying an expensive iPhone. While there is some potential relevance in terms of perceptions of value (such as Speaker B's belief about luxurious items), these connections are not clearly made or developed. Additionally, the other pieces of information about lotto tickets, living arrangements, and work on a family farm do not provide direct support for generating a relevant response in this context. Overall, the MEMORY lacks strong causal or relevant connections to the specific situation presented in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
