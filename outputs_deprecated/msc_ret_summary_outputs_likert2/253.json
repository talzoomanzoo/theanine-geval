Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden. Speaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways? Speaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there? Speaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot.  Speaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden? Speaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends. Speaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n4. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B discussed the differences between Sweden and the US, including coffee breaks.\n6. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some relevant information, such as Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden, which is consistent with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions their cousin helping with the trip planning. However, most of the MEMORY details are either irrelevant or inaccurate given the context. For example, Speaker A and Speaker B planning to travel to Sweden together is inaccurate, as the dialogue does not suggest this. The mentioned discussion about differences between Sweden and the US and coffee breaks is not referenced in the dialogue context, making it disconnected. The MEMORY lacks clear causality or relevance to the current conversation about Sweden and future travel plans. Thus, it offers limited helpfulness for generating a coherent and contextually appropriate response."
