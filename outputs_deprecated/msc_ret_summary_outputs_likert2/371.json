Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. Speaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?   Speaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone. Speaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you? Speaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession.\n2. Speaker A works at a stable and enjoys being around horses.\n3. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n4. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n5. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n6. Speaker B lives in the city and is interested in having a horse in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Therapy can definitely have an end goal, and it's great to see clients reach that point of completion. It's all about working through issues and reaching a place of healing and growth. If you ever decide to give it a try, I'd be happy to help guide you through that journey.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information about the speakers that could be relevant in the context of the conversation. It confirms that Speaker B is a therapist, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, much of the information in the MEMORY does not contribute directly to generating a response relevant to the specifics of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, the points about Speaker A working at a stable and enjoying horses, and Speaker B being a football fan or interested in horses, don't directly aid in developing the present conversation about therapy. Additionally, the information about Speaker B considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse or living in the city is also not tightly connected to the ongoing dialogue. More relevant details about their past discussions or shared experiences in a therapeutic context could make MEMORY more helpful."
