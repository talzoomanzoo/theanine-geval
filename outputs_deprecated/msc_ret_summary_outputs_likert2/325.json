Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes.  Speaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n2. Speaker B works at a Raccoon Cafe and takes care of Bandicoot, a raccoon.\n3. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n4. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n5. Speaker B considers raccoons intelligent and funny.\n6. Speaker A has not interacted closely with raccoons but admires them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I never thought about befriending them like that. I'll keep that in mind for the future. Thanks for the tip! Good luck with Bandicoot at work.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful, relevant information that aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The details about Speaker A's raccoon problem (point 1) directly relate to the context of Speaker A discussing their attempt to manage raccoons with aluminum sheeting. The mention of Speaker B working at a Raccoon Cafe and caring for Bandicoot (points 2 and 3) connects with their suggestion to befriend raccoons and their comment about raccoons' intelligence in the dialogue. Points 4 and 5 further establish Speaker B's experience and views on raccoons, which adds depth to the conversation in the context. However, point 6, while providing some insight into Speaker A's admiration for raccoons, isn't directly connected to their current action regarding the problem. Overall, the MEMORY connects well with the CONTEXT but could be slightly improved by further enhancing the connections or adding more relevant past interactions."
