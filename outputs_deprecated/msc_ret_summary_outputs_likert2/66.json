Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recommends Speaker A to watch 'Miracle'.\n2. Speaker B's husband enjoys Disney sports movies, such as 'Miracle'.\n3. Speaker B's kids enjoyed watching 'Luca' and said it was good.\n4. Speaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids.\n5. Speaker A has seen the Disney movie 'Luca' recently.\n6. Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the fact that Speaker B recommended the movie 'Miracle' to Speaker A (Memory 1). It shows a connection between Speaker B's preference and the recommendation given to Speaker A (Memory 2). However, the rest of the sentences (3, 4, 5, 6) provide additional context but are not directly related to the dialogue context at hand. Some sentences (like 3 and 5) mention 'Luca' which is not directly related to 'Miracle' or essential for generating the next response for 'Miracle.' The MEMORY contains relevant pieces of information and is somewhat connected, but it lacks a stronger connection or causality beyond what's given for the movie 'Miracle'."
