Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes.  Speaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me. Speaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house.  Speaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it.  Speaker A: That is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks? Speaker B: The only trick I was able to teach him, that I deeply regret, was how locks worked. I thought it was cool at first, you know, to see a raccoon unlock a door. And now, I regret it so much. I've had to change the layout of my apartment and put deadbolts on my doors so that Bandicoot can't get out. And, he is sneaky about it. One time, he unlocked the pantry and was eating some cookies! It's like having a toddler that never grows up. Speaker A: That is bad I guess.  Do you keep all of your chemicals, poisons, and medications up and locked?  I would hate to think what might happen if Bandicoot got into any of that.  Hey, when you drive do you lock him up in a cage or let him wander around in the car?  That could be dangerous for you driving and he freaks out. Speaker B: All the chemicals and poisons are in a gated lock in the basement. The lock requires a specific key, which I have hidden in my drawers. For medication, I have a small box that I also keep locked up, but it's a combination lock, so Bandicoot isn't able to get into it. For driving, I bought a harness that keeps him strapped in the back seat, he can move a bit, but mostly sturdy. I put blankets down and his favorite toys so that he stays calm. Sometimes, I'll pass small snacks to keep him occupied. I also take the side streets to work so that it's not too much for him. What about you? When you foster dogs, do you put them in a cage when you drive?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B works at a Raccoon Cafe and takes care of Bandicoot, a raccoon.\n2. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n3. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n4. Bandicoot was a rescue and has been at the Raccoon Cafe since he was a baby.\n5. Speaker B owns a raccoon named Bandicoot and a bearded dragon named Bob.\n6. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I don't foster dogs, so I've never had to deal with that issue. It sounds like you've got a good system in place for keeping Bandicoot safe while driving. It's great that you're so prepared and attentive to his needs.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information regarding Speaker B's experience with the raccoon, Bandicoot, and Speaker A's current raccoon problem, which are the two main topics discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory points regarding Speaker B working at a Raccoon Cafe and taking care of Bandicoot align with the context provided, as do the points about Speaker A dealing with a raccoon issue. However, the mention of a bearded dragon named Bob and some specific timelines or levels of interest in training raccoons (e.g., for over a month, being particularly interested in training) are not directly relevant to the immediate conversation. The memory can benefit a language model generating a response by making connections to the raccoon topics but lacks a bit of coherence to directly support a resp​​onse regarding the flow of the conversation in the given context."
