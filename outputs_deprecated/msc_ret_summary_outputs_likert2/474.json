Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer? Speaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to? Speaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors? Speaker B: Yes. That way they could have a fireworks show too. I love fireworks. Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle? Speaker A: No, but I have been to Disney World in Florida.  I love fireworks too.  I want to get married on the 4th of July.  That was we will have a national holiday and fireworks for us every year!  It sounds like you've been to Disneyland? Speaker B: No, but I thought you might have since you lived in LA for awhile. Did you get to see any live Disney music performances while you were at Disney World? Speaker A: No, we rode a lot of rides that broke down.  We had to be rescued from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.  It was stuck.  Someone put on waders and pushed us to the side to climb out. Speaker B: Oh no! Hopefully your trip to the art museum is much better than that. Did your boyfriend go to Disney World too? Speaker A: No, I had a cousin that I went with.  We stayed in a hotel in Miami too and I got so sunburned on the beach!  I'm sure the art museum will be good if it isn't too crowded.  Was your concert crowded? Speaker B: It was so crowded, but my older brothers went with me and kept me from getting squished. Make sure you wear sunscreen when you visit the beach this time! Speaker A: Yes, I know to put on SPF 75 this time!  So what is the art museum in Sao Paulo like?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is planning to visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend.\n2. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo.\n3. Speaker B recommends visiting the Museum of Art of São Paulo in the city.\n4. Speaker B mentions that there are all kinds of beaches in São Paulo, including busy, calm, and trendy ones.\n5. Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods.\n6. Speaker B was born in Brazil, specifically in San Paulo.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "The Museum of Art of São Paulo is really impressive. It has a great collection of artwork and the building itself is a work of art too. You'll love it!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some related information about speakers' interests which could be helpful, such as Speaker A's interest in museums and concerts, and Speaker B's recommendation regarding the Museum of Art of São Paulo. However, other sentences in MEMORY, such as details about beaches in São Paulo or Speaker B's background, are not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is centered around experiences at museums, Disney, and sunburn. Additionally, there is a lack of natural flow or connection showing causality or the development of past interactions between the two speakers. Overall, while some parts might be relevant, the MEMORY as a whole lacks coherence and depth in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
