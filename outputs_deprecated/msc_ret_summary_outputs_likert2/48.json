Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career. Speaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday. Speaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. Speaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n3. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n4. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n5. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth.\n6. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful for generating Speaker B's next response. It mentions Speaker B's focus on linguistics and their interest in turning it into a practical job, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B discusses career options and teaching. The MEMORY also notes Speaker B's consideration of a master's degree and their potential interest in becoming a college professor, which could be related to their thoughts on teaching as a stable career. However, MEMORY's connection between these details and how Speaker B would respond to the current context is not entirely clear or directly addressed, which limits its helpfulness. Furthermore, information about Speaker A, although insightful, does not directly aid in Speaker B's response. This makes the MEMORY moderately helpful but not exceptionally so."
