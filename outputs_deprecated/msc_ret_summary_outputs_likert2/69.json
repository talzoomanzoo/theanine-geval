    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it! Speaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to? Speaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you? Speaker B: I have been relaxing with the kids as much as I have. My husband has been busy with work, so we haven't had time for anything big. I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has seen the Disney movie 'Luca' recently.\n2. Speaker B's kids enjoyed watching 'Luca' and said it was good.\n3. Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good.\n4. Speaker B's husband enjoys Disney sports movies, such as 'Miracle'.\n5. Speaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids.\n6. Speaker A has booked a \"Hawaii Sunset\" tour for next month, being excited about it being their first time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I've never been to Italy before, but I've always wanted to go. Hawaii is a dream come true for me, so I'm really looking forward to the sunset tour. Italy is definitely on my bucket list too, hopefully we both get to visit someday!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that could be helpful for generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory points out that Speaker A recently watched \"Luca\", which is directly mentioned in the conversation. It also captures the essence of Speaker B's familial preferences for Disney movies, reinforcing Speaker B's dialogue about her family's enjoyment of \"Miracle\". Further, it notes Speaker A's excitement about a \"Hawaii Sunset\" tour, explicitly linked to Speaker A's comment in the dialogue. Although some parts are more specific than necessary, like details about Speaker B's kids' reaction to \"Luca\", the memory generally reflects connected and relevant elements from past interactions still present in the current dialogue. Hence, it offers useful information for the context, but a bit more coherence in overall causality could improve it to a perfect score."
