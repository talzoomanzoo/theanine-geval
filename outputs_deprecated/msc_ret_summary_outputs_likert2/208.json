Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice.  Speaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n2. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n3. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n4. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n5. Speaker A has given a pressure cooker as a gift and uses it for recipes like lamb shanks.\n6. Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I think you should start with a simple dahl recipe. It's easy to make and very flavorful. Plus, it's a staple in Indian cuisine so your husband might enjoy it as well. Let me know how it turns out!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several useful details relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker A is knowledgeable about cooking, particularly using a pressure cooker, which is consistent with their suggestion to Speaker B in the dialogue. The information that Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys Asian cuisine is directly relevant to the mentioned Asian recipes. Speaker B's interest in learning to use a pressure cooker suggests a motivation that aligns with the dialogue's context. The pressures of using a pressure cooker efficiently are also highlighted, reinforcing why Speaker A might recommend it. These pieces connect logically and add context to the current dialogue, although not all details are immediately pertinent to the next response (e.g., the specific recipes Speaker A uses). However, they provide a solid basis for suggesting recipe options or tips on efficient pressure cooker use in the upcoming conversation."
