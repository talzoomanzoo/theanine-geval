Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha! Speaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n3. Speaker A does not have any pets and expresses an interest in scuba diving.\n4. Speaker A is scared of sharks but finds the idea of going into a steel cage with them interesting.\n5. Speaker B prefers animals to humans but acknowledges the importance of curing diseases.\n6. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains information that is somewhat connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but not all parts are directly relevant to generating the next response from Speaker B.\n\n- Sentence 1 is directly relevant and helpful since it reiterates the names of Speaker B's pet snakes, which could be used in crafting a personalized response.\n- Sentence 2 highlights Speaker B's preference for animals over humans, which could offer some context for Speaker B's appreciation of the snakes' low maintenance.\n- Sentence 5 also connects to the theme of preferring animals; however, it introduces a new topic about curing diseases, which is unrelated to the current context.\n- Sentences 3, 4, and 6 are more about Speaker A and do not strongly tie into the conversation about Speaker B's snakes, thus offer little assistance for generating the next response.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides some useful information but also includes extraneous details that are not directly linked to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
