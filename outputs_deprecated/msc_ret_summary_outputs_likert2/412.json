Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it? Speaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see.  Speaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself? Speaker B: I was in Greece last two years ago.   I am excited to go again soon!    At somepoint I would like to take a cruise around the islands there.  It seems like a neat way to see all the Islands in an easy way.   Have you ever taken a cruise?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece.\n2. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\n3. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five.\n4. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian.\n5. Speaker B asks Speaker A if their trip is more for relaxation or sightseeing.\n6. Speaker A has traveled around Europe before, visiting capital cities of each country.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't taken a cruise around the Greek Islands before, but it sounds like an incredible experience! I might consider it for a future trip.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information, such as Speaker B's recommendation of visiting locations in Greece (which corresponds with Speaker A's current travel plans to the Acropolis), and shows that Speaker B has a general interest and excitement about Greece. These points are somewhat pertinent to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT - especially Speaker B's recommendation of visiting major attractions. However, the MEMORY does not clearly outline the relevancy or causality of these specific travel suggestions to the current conversation. Additionally, some sentences in MEMORY do not directly align with or advance the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT or may represent unrelated interactions, which impact the overall helpfulness of this MEMORY for formulating appropriate next responses."
