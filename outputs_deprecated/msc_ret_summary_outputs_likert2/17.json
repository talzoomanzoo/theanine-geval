    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim.  Speaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you  Speaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. Speaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you? Speaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it. Speaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has planned a cruise to the Caribbeans.\n2. Speaker A has planned to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n4. Speaker A plans to travel to the Caribbean for their next trip.\n5. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n6. Speaker A enjoys the food and the adventure of cruises.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that can aid in generating a response for Speaker B in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides details about the cruise to the Caribbean that Speaker A is planning, which aligns with the conversation about cruising and potential future trips together. However, the sentences in MEMORY are somewhat repetitive, particularly regarding the cruise, and the connections between the points are not very strong. Additionally, the MEMORY includes details about Speaker A enjoying food and adventure on cruises, which could be relevant information, but without more context in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it feels somewhat isolated. The point about punk music isn't specifically tied to Speaker B's preferences based on the context but rather seems like an assumption. Overall, while there are helpful elements, improving the connections and ensuring the information is distinctly relevant could increase the usefulness of the MEMORY."
