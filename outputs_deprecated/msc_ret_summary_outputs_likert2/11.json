Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n2. Speaker B is looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing.\n3. Speaker B enjoys cruising in their car while listening to punk music.\n4. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n5. Speaker A finds swimming relaxing and uses it to destress from their job.\n6. Speaker A has planned to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information, as it highlights Speaker B's enjoyment of punk music and various activities related to swimming and programming, which are key topics in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY includes several unrelated or less directly relevant items, such as cruising in a car listening to punk music and snorkeling at a cruise destination, which do not clearly tie into the immediate context of the planned meetup with a playlist for swimming and studying. While there is some partial relevancy, the lack of direct connection or causality between these memories and the immediate context reduces the overall helpfulness."
