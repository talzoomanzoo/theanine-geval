    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me? Speaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week? Speaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day Speaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through Speaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested. Speaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round. Speaker A: I would definitely recommend looking for a rental car to have on hand. There is a town within walking distance from me, but it can be dangerous to walk with the wolves and elk around, especially at night. Speaker B: I imagine so!!! I wouldn't want to run into a wolf! Ok. I will add car rental to my plans. Do you get scared with your dogs, that you will run into wildilfe like that?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n2. Speaker A mentioned the wildlife, including elk and wolves.\n3. Speaker A suggests going on hikes in Alaska to see wildlife and mentions glaciers as a potential attraction.\n4. Speaker B is interested in going whale watching and asks about a wolf petting zoo.\n5. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\n6. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Not really, my dogs are pretty good at keeping me safe. Plus, we have some measures in place to ensure the wildlife stays at a safe distance. Just be cautious and respectful of the animals, and you should be fine.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information about Speaker B's upcoming visit to Speaker A, including interests in concerts and wildlife. However, there are inaccuracies and a lack of coherence that impede its full helpfulness. For example, the mention of \"petting a wolf\" is not supported by the dialogue context, which emphasizes caution about wildlife, not interacting with it. Additionally, the parts about glaciers and Alaska are not mentioned or relevant to the current dialogue context. While Speaker A's invitation and concert plans are connected, the structure and relevance of sentences in MEMORY could be improved for clarity and pertinence to the ongoing conversation."
