Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping? Speaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures.\n2. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n3. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n4. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n5. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys.\n6. Speaker A is offering advice and seems to have experience with children.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a mix of relevant and less relevant information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Some points, such as Speaker B being a parent and their family being involved in activities like school field trips and camping trips, offer useful context about Speaker B's interests and family activities. However, the information about Speaker A's frequent zoo visits and their preferences for certain animals (tigers and monkeys) might not directly aid in crafting a response related to camping experiences. The connection between the concern for leaving a kitten alone during camping (point 1) and the current conversation about camping might be relevant, as it gives insight into Speaker B's experiences and considerations during trips. Overall, while there are aspects of MEMORY that are informative and relevant, not all points are directly helpful for generating responses about camping experiences."
