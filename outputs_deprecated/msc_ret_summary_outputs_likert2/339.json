Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n2. Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.\n3. Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys watching movies with them.\n4. Speaker B has a son and enjoys reading books, particularly about animals.\n5. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n6. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I prefer reading more informative books, like ones about animals. It's just my preference.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information that can be potentially useful for Speaker B to generate a response. For instance, it mentions Speaker A's enthusiasm for reading books and spending time with their grandchildren (points 2 and 5). This builds on the context where Speaker A is enjoying a new book after not watching the grandkids. Additionally, the mention of Speaker B's reading interests (point 4) could potentially be referenced in a response about contrasting book preferences.\n\nHowever, there is repetitive information regarding Speaker A's grandchildren which isn't directly useful for the immediate next response related to book preferences. Furthermore, certain points like watching Netflix shows (point 6) and the repetitive mention of movies (point 3) don't connect clearly to Speaker A and B's current dialogue about book preferences. The MEMORY could be more focused on elaborating Speaker Bâ€™s preference for reading about animals, which could lead to a more direct response suggestion about the contrast in book genres."
