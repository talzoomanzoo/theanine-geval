Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast. Speaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project. Speaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it.\n2. Speaker A is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active, enjoying martial arts.\n3. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things.\n4. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\n5. Speaker A is a martial arts teacher and student and is pursuing an athletic training degree in college.\n6. Speaker A is enrolled in a class on the history of martial arts and is majoring in athletic training.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad you had a good class. I'm working on a software project for work, but I also signed up for an online class on the history of martial arts. It's fascinating to learn more about the origins and techniques.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides detailed and relevant information about both Speaker A's and Speaker B's interests and activities, which offers useful context for generating subsequent responses. For example, knowing that Speaker A enjoys martial arts and is enrolled in martial arts history while also pursuing an athletic training degree would help Speaker B frame their responses or questions. Similarly, knowing that Speaker B is involved in software work and has an interest in martial arts can guide Speaker A's responses. Furthermore, the memory shows the connection between both speakers through their shared interest in martial arts. This common interest is particularly useful given the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where martial arts is being discussed. However, the structure could be improved for an even clearer flow of events or interactions between the speakers, which prevents it from being a perfect score."
