Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n2. Speaker B is interested in volunteering and prefers cats over dogs, especially kittens.\n3. Speaker A loves animals, especially puppies, and visits shelters in every city they go to.\n4. Speaker A is busy with work and used to foster puppies but no longer does.\n5. Speaker B is a 26-year-old workaholic who is unsure about their career and doesn't have strong opinions on puppies.\n6. Speaker A dreams of meeting all the puppies from history when they can move through space and time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful context about Speaker A's and Speaker B's interests and characteristics related to animals, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about a new cat at the shelter. It highlights Speaker A's love for animals, especially puppies, and their role in caring for both dogs and cats at the shelter. It also points out Speaker B's preference for cats, which could shape their response. However, some details such as Speaker A's dream about meeting puppies from history and Speaker B's career doubts are less relevant to the dialogue and do not directly contribute to generating a response. The connections between sentences are generally clear, but not all information is directly pertinent to the immediate dialogue about the new cat at the shelter."
