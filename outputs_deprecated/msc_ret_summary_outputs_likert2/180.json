Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you? Speaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses. Speaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set? Speaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up. Speaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe? Speaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood. Speaker A: Chemicals!  Do the actors hate working with it then?  I can imagine they are a pretty high maintenance bunch.  Do they worry about the blood messing with their looks?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n2. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.\n3. Speaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies, which influenced Speaker B's favorite genre.\n4. Speaker A prefers classic horror movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th over modern ones.\n5. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n6. Speaker B's dad works on smaller projects and has never been involved in a major Hollywood film.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "The actors are actually pretty cool about it. They understand that it's all part of the job and they're usually excited to get into character. They don't really worry about their looks, they're more focused on delivering a great performance.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: MEMORY provides useful background information about Speaker B's involvement in horror movies, which aligns with the discussion in DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker B creates horror movies and has a connection through their father, adding context to Speaker B's experiences and preferences. However, not all sentences in MEMORY are directly relevant to the ongoing conversation, such as Speaker A's preferences for classic horror movies and mid-century design. Additionally, there's some ambiguity regarding the roles of Speaker A and Speaker B in MEMORY, which might confuse a language model. The information is not seamlessly connected, especially concerning causality and relevancy to the current topic of fake blood and actors' experiences. Thus, MEMORY provides helpful context but lacks focus and cohesion with the current dialogue trajectory."
