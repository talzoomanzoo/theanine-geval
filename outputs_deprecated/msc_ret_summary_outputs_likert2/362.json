Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha! Speaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes? Speaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe.  Speaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm?  Speaker B: I'll be living off campus, so absolutely. How about you? Are you staying in the dorms?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A does not have any pets and expresses an interest in scuba diving.\n3. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n4. Speaker B is excited about taking neuroscience classes next year.\n5. Speaker B goes to Hawaii for scuba diving and is considering studying marine life or a different type of animal.\n6. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm actually thinking about getting my scuba diving certification this summer and spending my free time exploring the underwater world. It's so different from observing animals on land, but equally fascinating in its own way.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: MEMORY provides some relevant information that could help a language model generate a proper response for Speaker A. For example, it confirms that Speaker B has two snakes, Hansel and Gretel, which directly relates to the dialogue context and maintains continuity. Additionally, details about both speakers' interests in animals and science can shape their ongoing conversation. However, there's some information in MEMORY that seems less directly relevant to the current dialogue flow, like Speaker A's interest in scuba diving and volunteering plans, which may not significantly contribute to a response based on the provided DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, while helpful in parts, it doesn't completely align with the conversation theme, resulting in a moderate rating."
