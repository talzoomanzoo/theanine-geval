Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n2. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n3. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n4. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n5. Speaker A wishes to get better grades and is hopeful for a soccer scholarship.\n6. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great! A B is still a good grade, and it shows improvement. Keep up the good work and keep pushing yourself. You'll get that A next time!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It informs us that Speaker B is taking exams in sports medicine, which connects to the current conversation topic about upcoming exams. It also describes Speaker B's pressure to maintain good grades, which can relate to their feelings about exams. However, the MEMORY contains several details about Speaker A's struggles with other subjects that are not directly relevant to the current dialogue, as Speaker A is only discussing their history exam. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it provided more details specifically about Speaker B's current exam situation or feelings towards upcoming finals, making the connections more direct and complete."
