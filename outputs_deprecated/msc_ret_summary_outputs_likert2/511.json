Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand. Speaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n2. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n3. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n4. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments.\n5. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n6. Speaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I think that sounds like a wonderful idea! It would be a great tradition to start with your grandkids. I wish I could spend more time with my own kids like that.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of information that are helpful for a language model representing Speaker A in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Points 1 and 2 in MEMORY directly connect with the current conversation about the annual fishing trip, highlighting Speaker B's past experience and intent to cultivate an interest in nature among their grandkids. This makes these memory points relevant to the current topic of discussion. \n\nAdditionally, memory point 5 gives context about Speaker A's family situation and work commitments, which is directly relevant to the ongoing context where Speaker A discusses their work affecting family interactions.\n\nWhile memory points 3, 4, and 6 add context to Speaker B's life regarding their relationship with their grandkids, they are slightly less directly connected to the current dialogue context. However, they still enrich the understanding of Speaker B's family life and preferences, which can be handy in shaping relevant responses.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY entries are naturally connected and offer useful background information that can be applied to the dialogue, hence a score of 4."
