Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim.  Speaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you  Speaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. Speaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you? Speaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it. Speaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car? Speaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming. Speaker A: That would be great too. I like to program in several different languages. Do you have a preference? Speaker B: No, I'm just getting started so I don't have a preference. Maybe you could show me what you prefer and we could start there. Speaker A: Sure. I usually like to start with html and css so we can start there. We'll order some pizzaburgers to help us out. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n2. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n4. Speaker A has planned to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination.\n5. Speaker B is interested in learning programming and is already practicing.\n6. Speaker A has planned a cruise to the Caribbeans.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information about certain aspects of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A offering to teach Speaker B swimming and programming, and their discussion about a cruise. However, it does not completely capture the details of the context, such as the playlist or the specific programming languages Speaker A suggests (html and css). Some connections and causality, like Speaker B wanting to learn swimming and programming and the relation to their meetup, are present. However, other elements, like the enjoyment of punk music linked to specific activities, are not accurately represented or are slightly inaccurate. improving the coherence and connection of these details could make the MEMORY more helpful."
