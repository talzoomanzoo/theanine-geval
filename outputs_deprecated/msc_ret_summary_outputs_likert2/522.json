Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing? Speaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from? Speaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there. Speaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n2. Speaker A is considering getting kittens and thinks rats can be smart.\n3. Speaker B is in college, paints on the side, and has five dogs and three rats.\n4. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets.\n5. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy the company of their pets and think they are smart and playful.\n6. Speaker A prefers adopting pets from shelters rather than from breeders.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of information that are helpful and relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance:\n\n- Sentence 3 (\"Speaker B is in college, paints on the side, and has five dogs and three rats\") is relevant, as it mentions Speaker B's painting hobby, which aligns with their interest in painting a portrait of their great dane and pet rat.\n  \n- Sentence 6 (\"Speaker A prefers adopting pets from shelters rather than from breeders\") is directly relevant to the conversation about Speaker A's intent to adopt a cat from a shelter.\n\nHowever, some statements, such as Sentence 1 (\"Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions\") and Sentence 4 (\"Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals...\"), do not directly inform the immediate context or flow of the current dialogue. Therefore, the MEMORY does a good job of providing useful background information, but it could be slightly more directly aligned to enhance its helpfulness further."
