Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know.  Speaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like. Speaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too. Speaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n4. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.\n5. Speaker A is a guitar player and values jam time over social time.\n6. Speaker A frequents live band venues and plays music at home.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "No, I think I'll be flying solo for this one. Just me, my guitar, and some good bluegrass music. I'm looking forward to jamming out and soaking up the festival vibes.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The information that Speaker B's wife is pregnant (1) ties in well with the consideration of staying at a more comfortable location for the Bluegrass show, potentially making staying at the cabin more appealing. The shared interest in bluegrass music (2) helps contextualize why both speakers are interested in attending the festival. However, the mention of discussing logistics with a small baby (3) isn't directly applicable to the current context, as they are not discussing those details in the dialogue. Speaker B's jealousy (4) and Speaker A's guitar and music habits (5, 6) are unrelated to the specifics of the current conversation about logistics or shared plans and do not directly assist in generating a response in the current interaction. The MEMORY contains some useful background information but lacks direct relevance and connectedness to the ongoing conversation in DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
