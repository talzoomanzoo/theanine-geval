Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone?  Speaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!). Speaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n2. Speaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\n3. Speaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding.\n4. Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\n5. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety.\n6. Speaker A is training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information about the relationship between Speakers A and B, as well as their shared interest in running and motivational speaking. Specifically:\n\n1. Sentence 1 explains the context of previous interactions where Speaker A invited Speaker B to run and train together, which aligns with the current topic of running and motivation.\n2. Sentence 2 and 4 provide background information on Speaker B's expertise as a motivational speaker, which is relevant to Speaker A's comment about needing motivation to run.\n3. Sentence 3 highlights Speaker B's personal experience with running marathons, which is pertinent to the subject being discussed.\n4. Sentence 5 offers insight into Speaker B's personal motivation journey, adding depth to their character as a motivational speaker.\n5. Sentence 6 connects to Speaker A's interest in marathons and their need for advice, which ties into the current dialogue context about motivation.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY contains information that enhances the language model's ability to generate a coherent and contextually informed response in the dialogue. The sentences are mostly interconnected and relevant to the current conversation, demonstrating clear causality and relevance. However, it could provide a more explicit connection to the specific running event mentioned in the current dialogue."
