Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work? Speaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol Speaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise?  Speaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows. Speaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking, mentioning setting up a hammock at their campsite.\n3. Speaker A is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock.\n4. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n5. Speaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B have gone hiking together before and plan to meet up for another hike.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That does sound like a dream job, being out in nature as a guide. I can see you really enjoying that kind of work. And hiking is a great way to recharge and have some alone time. Maybe we can plan another hiking trip soon to catch up and enjoy the outdoors together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant sentences that could potentially aid Speaker B in crafting a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it highlights shared interests like camping and hiking, as well as prior shared activities (e.g., hiking together), which offer touchpoints for Speaker B to relate to or reference. However, the MEMORY also includes information that does not align directly with the most recent interaction (such as Speaker A being a recent high school graduate and being on a cross-country journey, which are not mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT). Additionally, the MEMORY lacks clear causality or development directly relevant to the immediate conversation surrounding their current job situations and aspirations, so not all sentences effectively contribute to advancing the dialogue context."
