Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains information about Speaker A's and Speaker B's interests in surfing and other activities, but it lacks direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context focuses more on music, particularly the favorite rock band, learning musical instruments, and some mentions of surfing. While MEMORY does mention surfing and Speaker A's background, it introduces new, unrelated information like fishing, teaching how to fish and cook, which breaks the connection and adds potential confusion. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it directly addressed the topics of music and instrument learning discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, there's a lack of a natural progression or direct causality linking MEMORY with the ongoing conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
