Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week? Speaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you? Speaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions? Speaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like? Speaker A: I like all kinds of games. I like party, fighting, RPGs, shooters, action, adventure, and puzzle games. I enjoy playing Jurassic Park: World but I'd like to find another game to play. The storm means I'll be inside for a bit, so I think I'll curl up with some pizza and just zone out. Do you like to do anything else besides game when it's rainy? Speaker B: Well, I might help around the house with cleaning or laundry, but not that much. Mostly gaming. If I feel I sat too long, I'll switch to Nintendo Switch's Ring Fit Adventure to get my body moving a bit. Do yo know that game? Speaker A: I've heard of it. I think I need to get some exercise, so that might be a good idea. I'd like to stay in shape as much as I can. I guess games are the best way to do that! That's a good suggestion. How about you? Do you only like games like RE? What other genres do you like? Speaker B: I like fighting too, but not RPG types. I tried racing games before, but clearly not good at it so I'm not enjoying them that much. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n2. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n3. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n4. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n5. Speaker A does not play video games often but may consider trying them.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy playing video games in their free time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I see, it's great that you have a variety of games you enjoy playing. It's always good to have different options depending on your mood. I'll definitely consider trying out Ring Fit Adventure for some exercise. Thanks for the suggestion!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about the speakers' past interactions related to video games. However, there are inconsistencies and inaccuracies that impact its helpfulness. For instance, Speaker A trying out Resident Evil is mentioned as a plan in MEMORY, but in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, Speaker A has already played a little despite disliking scary games. Additionally, MEMORIES 2 and 6 mention Speaker B's enjoyment of video games, which aligns with the context, but the specific mention of League of Legends and Resident Evil VIII does not directly connect with the context.\n\nMEMORY 4 is somewhat relevant as it provides information about Speaker B's perspective on Resident Evil being scary, which aligns with Speaker A's reluctance in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, MEMORY 5 does not align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as Speaker A did play a bit. Overall, the MEMORY lacks clear causality or natural progression of past interactions, making it less helpful for generating the next response."
