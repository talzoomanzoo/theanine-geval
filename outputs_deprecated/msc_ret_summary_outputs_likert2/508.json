Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments.\n2. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n3. Speaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\n4. Speaker A has children and grandchildren, with at least one child interested in learning the flute.\n5. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n6. Speaker A's other children are addicted to tablets and phones, unlike the youngest one who is interested in music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I do use text messaging to stay in touch with them. But sometimes I wish they were more interested in playing musical instruments like your youngest one.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some insights about Speaker B's relationship and activities with their grandkids, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT of interacting using technology. However, the MEMORY primarily focuses on activities (e.g., spending time at the park, fishing) and hobbies (e.g., interest in phones and tablets) that only indirectly relate to using technology like text messaging. While it mentions the grandkids' interest in phones and tablets, it does not explicitly connect this interest to the practice of texting or interacting via technology. Overall, MEMORY offers some relevant information, but lacks a strong connection to the specific topic of text messaging with grandkids, which affects its helpfulness for generating a response."
