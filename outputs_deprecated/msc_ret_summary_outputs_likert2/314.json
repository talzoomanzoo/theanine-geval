Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think? Speaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A's favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, saying \"for you I shall live\".\n2. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n3. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n4. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n5. Speaker B enjoys fishing and wishes their wife and sons could have joined them on the trip.\n6. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That would be a wonderful tribute to your family. Tattoos can hold so much meaning, it's a great way to carry those special memories with you everywhere.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information about Speaker A's previous tattoos and future tattoo plans, which are relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about getting a tattoo to honor Speaker A's mom. Sentences 1, 2, and 3 in the MEMORY create a coherent picture of Speaker A's motivations and sentimental reasons for getting tattoos, which can help Speaker A generate a meaningful response. Additionally, sentence 6 about Speaker A's mom owning a coffee shop may add context or a factor in deciding on a tattoo for their mom. Although sentences 4 and 5 provide additional information about the speakers, they are less relevant to the tattoo discussion and do not directly aid the development of a response related to the ongoing conversation. Therefore, MEMORY is helpful, but not perfectly aligned, with the current context."
