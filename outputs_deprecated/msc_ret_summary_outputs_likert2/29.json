Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok?  Speaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish? Speaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus! Speaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well? Speaker A: Yes, I am thinking about trying either the new eclairs, or their tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle! I have too many good options to pick from! What one would you pick? Speaker B: Hands down, I would pick the tres leches. Ever since I tried it a few years ago, it has always been my favorite dessert. Speaker A: Okay, I will try that! I've heard the can be made with different fruits. Did you have fruit with yours? Speaker B: I like it best with fresh strawberries. And then it is even better with some fresh whipped cream and chocolate drizzle. Just thinking about it is making me want to have some right now!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n2. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n3. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n4. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n5. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n6. Speaker A's restaurant plays a mix of songs, mainly easy listening, to create a relaxing environment for diners.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds absolutely delicious! I'll definitely have to try it with fresh strawberries and all those extra toppings. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful background information that could help generate a response in the current dialogue context. For instance, points 1 and 2 indicate that Speaker A works at a restaurant and has certain perks like free meals, which ties into the conversation about trying the new dish at work. However, the connection to Speaker B or the specifics of the conversation about desserts is lacking. Points 3, 5, and 6 offer additional context about Speaker A and B's preferences and the restaurant's environment, but they are not closely related to the current dialogue's focus on specific food items. The MEMORY sentences are somewhat relevant but not deeply connected in terms of causality to the ongoing exchange, hence a middle score of 3."
