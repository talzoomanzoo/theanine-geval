Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I've been in touch with my friends in Europe and we are planning to meet up in Italy during my trip. It will be great to explore together and catch up.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, with sentences that are mostly connected and show causality or relevancy between the speakers' past interactions. \n\n1. Sentence 1 directly aligns with the dialogue about Speaker B's interest in visiting Greece, as expressed in the conversation.\n2. Sentence 2 provides useful information about Speaker A's planned trip to Italy, which is relevant to the discussion about their travel intentions.\n3. Sentence 3 adds more context to Speaker A's interests, which can help in generating responses related to travel or history discussions.\n4. Sentence 4 connects well with Speaker B's previous travel experience to Italy, which supports the ongoing travel discussion.\n5. Sentence 5 ties in with the conversation about Greek mythology, which has been a topic of mutual interest for both speakers.\n\nSentences 2 and 6 overlap slightly regarding Speaker A's travel preparations, but they are consistent with the theme of spring travel. Overall, the memory is helpful, but sentence 6 about the dress may not directly contribute to the next response unless fashion comes up in the dialogue. The memory's cohesion and relevancy to the dialogue earn it a score of 4."
