Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that? Speaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading? Speaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n2. Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.\n3. Speaker B has a son and enjoys reading books, particularly about animals.\n4. Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys watching movies with them.\n5. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n6. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about both speakers' interests and hobbies, such as Speaker A's enjoyment of Netflix and books, particularly movies, and Speaker B's interest in animal books. This background information is somewhat helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as it aligns with the ongoing conversation about books and movie adaptations. However, the MEMORY could be more helpful if it included more specific and naturally connected interactions between the two speakers regarding their past discussions or opinions about books or media. The sentences in the memory are somewhat disjointed and do not clearly demonstrate causality or progression in their past interactions beyond their general interests."
