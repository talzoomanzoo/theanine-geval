Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting! Speaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow? Speaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n3. Speaker B is considering giving up their night job to focus on lab work and school.\n4. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n5. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n6. Speaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful context about Speaker B's background and interests, which can help generate a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It outlines Speaker B's work and study commitments, their interest in lab work, and their plans to major in molecular biology, all of which are relevant to the conversation. They are considering quitting a job for school, which connects to their concerns about balancing classes with lab work. However, some parts of the MEMORY, such as Speaker A wanting to try Speaker B's diner hamburgers, don't seem directly relevant to the conversation about cloned cows. Overall, MEMORY provides a good context on Speaker B's interests and constraints in balancing work, but it could better highlight how they feel about cloned food to be more directly helpful for the dialogue context."
