Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping? Speaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future.

Speaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping? Speaker B: We usually do tents but we have camped in yurts too.

Speaker A: I think the Bronx Zoo is one of the best in the country.   Yes, I did see Joshua.  Did you use a season pass for the zoo or just a one time ticket?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n2. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n3. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys.\n4. Speaker B is interested in finding family discounts for the zoo.\n5. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n6. Speaker A suggests taking the pets to the zoo and mentions that most major cities have good zoos.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "We used a season pass for the zoo. It's definitely worth it if you plan on visiting regularly.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks clear causal connections that could be more helpful. For instance, MEMORY points out that Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo, which corresponds with the Dialogue Context mentioning Speaker A's visit to the Bronx Zoo. MEMORY also reveals that Speaker B is a parent and is pushing for a field trip, which corresponds with Speaker B's visit to the zoo with her daughter. However, some parts of the MEMORY, such as Speaker A suggesting taking pets to the zoo, are not contextually relevant to the current conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and don't provide strong connections or causality. Overall, MEMORY can be more helpful if the sentences were more connected and provided clearer causality related to the current exchanges in the dialogue."
