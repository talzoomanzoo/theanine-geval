Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended.  Speaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along! Speaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them. Speaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me! Speaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n2. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n3. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot.\n4. Speaker B has two sick kitties and recently received a rescue.\n5. Speaker B lives in the city they grew up in, loves animals, and has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n6. Speaker A's parrot Tasha has seen cats before and ignores them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I totally get that, bugs can be such a nuisance during the summer months. Fall hiking sounds perfect, the cooler weather and fewer bugs make it much more enjoyable.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes details such as Speaker A having a parrot named Tasha and considering adopting a rescue kitten (points 1 and 2), which are attributes mentioned in the context that could influence the continuation of the conversation. Furthermore, the distinction that Tasha has seen cats before and ignores them (point 6) offers a natural connection and causality that might be useful for addressing any concerns about the parrot's interaction with kittens. However, the MEMORY also contains some extra information (points 3-5) that isn't clearly connected or relevant to the current dialogue context, like Speaker B receiving a rescue or having sick kitties. These points don't add much value to the immediate conversation, reducing the helpfulness score."
