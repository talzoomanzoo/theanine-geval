Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me. Speaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway? Speaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible. Speaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most? Speaker A: I like to go hiking in the local trails here. I am familiar with them and there's so many routes that I can take. Sadly, the bugs are as bad here as they are anywhere else.....\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks.\n2. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n3. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities.\n4. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n5. Speaker A is nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy being outdoors, but Speaker B prefers the fresh air over being in the mud and rain.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I can imagine the bugs being a nuisance, but it sounds like you have everything prepared to handle them. Maybe I'll give it a try with you sometime, as long as we can avoid the bugs!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly related to Speaker A's enjoyment of outdoor activities like hiking and camping, which is consistent with the context where Speaker A talks about hiking. However, the MEMORY contains inaccurate or less relevant details. For example, Speaker B is described as having recently enjoyed a long hike, which contradicts the context where Speaker B expresses not being a fan of the outdoors. Additionally, the MEMORY's mention of the Appalachian Trail, which could have been relevant, is not directly connected to the specific context provided. Overall, the MEMORY has helpful elements but lacks strong cohesion with the specific details of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
