Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n2. Speaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition.\n3. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n4. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n5. Speaker A is eating their favorite jello.\n6. Speaker B also enjoys jello, with cherry being their favorite flavor as well.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY generally provides relevant and helpful information for Speaker A to generate a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains several connections between Speaker A and jello recipes, similar to Speaker B’s situation. The MEMORY indicates that Speaker A has a grandmother who taught them jello recipes (1, 2), which is a direct parallel to Speaker B teaching their kids. This shared experience might allow Speaker A to establish common ground and relate personally to Speaker B's current activity.\n\nAdditionally, MEMORY relates to Speaker A’s strong connection with the cherry-flavored jello (4), which could provide an avenue for Speaker A to build rapport by commenting on flavors or family traditions. Speaker A’s eating jello (5) and the mention of Speaker B enjoying jello with a preference for cherry flavor (6) give scope for shared preferences and experiences to be discussed.\n\nHowever, point 3 about suggesting that Speaker B view Speaker A’s grandmother as a surrogate is somewhat abstract (less relevant in the immediate future response) and can slightly detract from the linearity of the MEMORY. However, most details do align well, enabling meaningful engagement."
