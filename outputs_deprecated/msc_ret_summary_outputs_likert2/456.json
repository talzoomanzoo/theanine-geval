Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well? Speaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon? Speaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now! Speaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next.\n2. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour.\n3. Speaker A has multiple sons, at least one of them is in a relationship with a Spanish girlfriend.\n4. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\n5. Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away.\n6. Speaker B has two sons, one of whom has had a girlfriend for several years and the other is secretive.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, MEMORY 1, 3, and 4 provide context about Speaker A's sons being abroad in Europe, aligning with the dialogue's discussion about visiting a son in Spain. MEMORY 3 also mentions a son being in a relationship with a Spanish girlfriend, which relates to the dialogue about meeting the girlfriend. However, not all sentences are seamlessly connected or entirely relevant. The mentioning of Speaker Bâ€™s younger son in MEMORY 2 and 6, and the secretive nature of the other son, seems less connected to the current conversation and does not enhance the understanding of the discussed topic. The sentences in the MEMORY could be better connected to provide clearer and more helpful context for generating a response."
