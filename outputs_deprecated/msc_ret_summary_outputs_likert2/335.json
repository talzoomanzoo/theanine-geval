Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n2. Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.\n3. Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys watching movies with them.\n4. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n5. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n6. Speaker A suggests taking naps during quiet times and mentions watching her grandkids.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a nice way to relax and unwind. What book did you pick up?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT by confirming that Speaker A has grandchildren and is involved in activities with them. It also notes Speaker A's enjoyment of reading, which aligns with Speaker A's current activity of checking out a new book. However, the MEMORY contains repeated points (Speaker A having grandchildren) and could provide more varied or connecting information about Speaker A's relationship with their grandchildren or other activities they enjoy. The sentences lack a coherent narrative of past interactions or strong connections that would enhance understanding of the current context, leading to a moderate score."
