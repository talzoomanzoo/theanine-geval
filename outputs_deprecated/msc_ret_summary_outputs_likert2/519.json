Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly!

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe memory provides a significant amount of relevant information helpful for generating a response in the given dialogue context. It clearly outlines that Speaker A is having a portrait painted by Speaker B, which is directly relevant to the dialogue as the portrait is being discussed. The memory also indicates that Speaker B is a painter, working on portraits, including others' and taking care of a sick dog, which could inform more personal or empathetic responses depending on the direction of the conversation. Furthermore, details about Speaker B's interests in painting and their preference for pets and regular people provide substance for creative or affectionate dialogue. The mention of the portrait involving Speaker A and their brother when Speaker A is asking about \"the little furries\" can connect to Speaker B's interests in pets, making it pertinent. However, while useful, some information such as Speaker A's interest in couponing deals feels somewhat disconnected from the immediate dialogue context. Overall, the memory is well-rounded and helpful, but not every piece is immediately relevant to the current context, hence a score of 4."
