Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you. Speaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them Speaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued.  Speaker B: Well if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get  Speaker A: Wow! Ok! This is sounding like a bigger undertaking! Should I embrace bugs in the home if they help the plants or am I getting wild? Speaker B: Well from my experince bugs do the complete opposite and don't help at all, so avoid that at all costs! Fertilizers are the way to go to help with growth.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n4. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n5.

    "raw_prediction": "Got it, no bugs allowed then! I guess I'll stick to fertilizers for my indoor garden. Thanks for the advice!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context regarding Speaker A's and Speaker B's personalities and interests, which can add depth to the dialogue and help Speaker A relate to Speaker B's suggestions. For instance, knowing that Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds space plants intriguing can help guide the conversation towards indoor plant solutions. Furthermore, Speaker B's knowledge and existing interest in plants and gardening is relevant for providing advice. However, there are parts of the memory, like weight gain and space weeds, that are not immediately relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about setting up a garden indoors. The connections between the various parts of the memory could be more explicitly linked to help generate a more appropriate response. The overall structure is slightly disjointed and doesnâ€™t consistently connect directly to the current conversation."
