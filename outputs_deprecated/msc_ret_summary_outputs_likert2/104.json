Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make? Speaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it. Speaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too? Speaker B: Yeah definitely! I know you like hot foods, so if you learn and can make them fresh it will taste amazing. Have you tried any new foods lately? Speaker A: Not any new foods, but I did try a new food truck near me that was delicious! It was street tacos and you could pick from barbacoa, chicken, and steak for the protein. Do you like Mexican food?  Speaker B: Oh god I do love Mexican food. That was be so hard to pick because they're all so good! Did they have al pastor by any chance? I loved marinated pork tacos. Speaker A: unfortunately no, but I can ask them if they plan to get it in the future. I had one of each and they were all good in their own way. Have you ever had Birra tacos? I'd love to try those next. Speaker B: I've never had birra tacos, what are those? They sound intriguing.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally.\n2. Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\n3. Speaker A plays the drums and loves making food for others.\n4. Speaker A enjoys cooking and finds it helpful for stress relief.\n5. Speaker A cooked steak, fried potatoes, and shrimp for dinner with their father.\n6. Speaker B is interested in the weather in October at Speaker A's location.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Birria tacos are a traditional Mexican dish made with stewed and shredded meat, usually beef, that's served in a crispy tortilla with melted cheese. They're absolutely delicious! I'll have to make them for you sometime.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be useful for generating a response, particularly points 1, 2, and 4 which relate to Speaker A's and Speaker B's interests in cooking. These entries help reinforce the context of the conversation, which revolves around cooking and trying new foods. However, the connection between these memories and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is not particularly strong or causally demonstrated. For instance, there is no mention of Birra tacos or Mexican food, specifically. Also, points 3, 5, and 6 are less relevant to the current dialogue and do not contribute directly to the natural progression of this specific conversation about spicy foods and Mexican cuisine. Overall, while there is a mild level of relevance, the MEMORY does not fully support the DIALOGUE CONTEXT in a deeply meaningful or connected way."
