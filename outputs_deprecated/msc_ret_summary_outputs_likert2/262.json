Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment.  Speaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon? Speaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think? Speaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n2. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n3. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n4. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue.\n5. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n6. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fascinating! I had no idea origami could be used in the hospital like that. It sounds like there's so much more to it than just folding paper. I'm really looking forward to learning from you and seeing what we can create together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of information that are relevant to understanding the dialogue context and could be helpful in generating Speaker B's next response. It reveals Speaker A's interest and skill in origami, noting that they have successfully made a Lotus flower and have learned origami by themselves in their craft room. This background supports Speaker A's credibility in teaching origami. Speaker B's expressed interest in origami is validated by their enthusiasm for learning and their particular interest in making origami animals, which are described as cute. \n\nMoreover, MEMORY information aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT in terms of establishing Speaker A's qualifications to teach origami and Speaker B's curiosity. However, the mention of Speaker A offering to teach Speaker B in specific weeks could be more directly relevant or tied into a concrete future interaction plan, and some statements, such as the one about making a lotus next, seem a bit redundant or inconsistent with the progression. Despite these minor issues, the connectivity and relevancy greatly enhance the coherence of the conversation and future dialogue continuity."
