Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me. Speaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway? Speaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible. Speaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most? Speaker A: I like to go hiking in the local trails here. I am familiar with them and there's so many routes that I can take. Sadly, the bugs are as bad here as they are anywhere else..... Speaker B: They can't be that bad in the fall right? I hope? Do you camp most every weekend? Speaker A: A least a couple of times a month. Sometimes, yeah, I go every weekend to relax. Being in nature is so relaxing to me. And nah the bugs aren't too bad in the fall and winter. There's a beautiful river along one trail that I bet you'd love to see.  Speaker B: That sounds like it would be relaxing. I would probable be okay if we didn't run into any wolves, bears etc. Have you ever came across any predators when you were camping?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks.\n2. Speaker A enjoys camping trips and looking for wild animals in the woods.\n3. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities.\n4. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n5. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n6. Speaker A is comfortable around animals in the woods but admits a bear would make them jumpy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I've encountered some deer, raccoons, and even a few coyotes, but thankfully no bears or wolves. Although I have to admit, the thought of running into a bear does make me a bit jumpy. But with proper precautions and being aware of our surroundings, we should be fine.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it mentions Speaker A's enjoyment of camping and hiking, which aligns with their interest in leading friends on hikes and being in nature. It also notes Speaker A's comfort with animals, though cautious around bears, which ties into Speaker B's concern about predators. However, the MEMORY includes elements like Speaker A planning to hike the Appalachian Trail, or Speaker B recently going on a long hike, which are not directly relevant to the current context. Some connections, such as Speaker A's specific planned trips, are not mentioned in the dialogue, limiting the direct helpfulness. The MEMORY is partially aligned but could be more cohesive and directly connected to the ongoing conversation."
