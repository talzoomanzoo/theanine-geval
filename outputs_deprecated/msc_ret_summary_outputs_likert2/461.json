Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well? Speaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon? Speaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now! Speaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her? Speaker A: I think so.  She seems like a very sweet girl and she seems to care deeply about my son, so that's what matters most.  You know, maybe I can stop by and visit you as well, since you live in Europe.  France, Spain, Italy?  Where are you living now? Speaker B: Bless her, that's good to hear. That would be great! I live in Portugal. It's not too far from Spain. We can always arrange something. How long would you be there for? Speaker A: I'm planning to stay in Spain for three weeks.  Since you live in Portugal, I'd love to stop by for a visit if you're free this coming month.  I've always wanted to visit Lisbon.  It has the world's longest bridge! Speaker B: That'a great idea. We have a holiday house just outside of Lisbon. You are welcome to lodge with us. Speaker A: Sounds great!  I'm already very excited about my trip to Spain, and now I get to visit you in Lisbon!  I need to brush up on my Spanish and also start studying Portuguese.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next.\n2. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\n3. Speaker A has multiple sons, at least one of them is in a relationship with a Spanish girlfriend.\n4. Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away.\n5. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour.\n6. Speaker A's boys are leaving again in a few months for another trip after studying abroad.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for understanding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but its contribution is limited by a few inaccuracies or irrelevant details. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. Sentence 1 provides a partially accurate detail but introduces Italy, which is not mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It can be slightly misleading.\n2. Sentence 2 is not directly connected to the context, which focuses on a trip to Spain and potentially Portugal, not about sons coming home for winter break.\n3. Sentence 3 is somewhat relevant as it mentions Speaker A's son having a Spanish girlfriend, aligning with Speaker A's plan to meet her.\n4. Sentence 4's overall idea fits as Speaker A is excited to visit, but it doesn't directly address the current context of visiting Europe and meeting the girlfriend.\n5. Sentence 5 seems irrelevant as there is no indication of Speaker B's younger son's feelings about Speaker A's sons in the conversation.\n6. Sentence 6 refers to another trip after studying abroad but does not provide specific help for the interaction focused on the planned visit to Europe.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY needs more alignment and direct relevance to the context described, but it contains useful elements that could inform Speaker B's response."
