Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?   Speaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere! Speaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it. Speaker A: I don't have recipes but I know how to make a good grilled asparagus. Are you looking to bolster your chef book? Speaker B: I sure am!  Grilled asparagus does sound good.  Do you pair the grilled asparagus with your fajitas?  What do you prefer, chicken or beef fajitas? Speaker A: I prefer chicken to beef. I pair it with beef fajitas andI think it's great to have with a glass of merlot. Do you like wine? Speaker B: You're making me hungry!  Yes, I do love wine.  As a matter of fact, I used to live in the Bordeaux region in France, so my favorite wine is Bordeaux wine.  But I also love champagne and cognac. Speaker A: Haha, I know right? I lived in the Champagne region for a bit! Always wanted to go to Bordeaux. How was it there?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is interested in trying different careers and is considering becoming a chef for Speaker A who loves Mexican food and seafood.\n2. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines.\n4. Speaker A enjoys grilling indoors and suggests grilled asparagus with lemon on it.\n5. Speaker A loves animals, especially puppies, and visits shelters in every city they go to.\n6. Speaker A is more interested in science than music, while Speaker B enjoys listening to Black Sabbath and grilling meat.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Bordeaux was amazing! The wine, the food, the atmosphere - it was all so perfect. You should definitely visit if you get the chance.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that could help in generating a response for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it mentions that Speaker A enjoys cooking, making fajitas, and grilling asparagus, which relates to the conversation about recipes and pairing asparagus with fajitas. The MEMORY also indicates that Speaker A loves animals, especially puppies, aligning with the initial topic of animals in the conversation. However, the MEMORY also contains information that does not connect well or show clear causality with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's interest in different careers or their music preferences, which are not discussed in the current conversation. Overall, the MEMORY has some useful insights but lacks coherence and complete relevance to the ongoing dialogue, hence a middle score."
