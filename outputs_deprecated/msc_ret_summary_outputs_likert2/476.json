    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?  \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n2. Speaker B is interested in volunteering and prefers cats over dogs, especially kittens.\n3. Speaker A loves animals, especially puppies, and visits shelters in every city they go to.\n4. Speaker B is a 26-year-old workaholic who is unsure about their career and doesn't have strong opinions on puppies.\n5. Speaker A is busy with work and used to foster puppies but no longer does.\n6. Speaker A dreams of meeting all the puppies from history when they can move through space and time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Puppies bring so much joy and excitement with their playful and energetic nature. They always seem so full of life and pure happiness. But I understand that everyone has their preferences when it comes to animals. What is it about kittens that you love so much?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers several insights that could help generate a proper response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The mention that Speaker A mainly cares for dogs and has a preference for puppies is relevant to the conversation about kittens and puppies. Additionally, Speaker B’s preference for cats and Speaker A’s general love for animals could be useful in understanding their respective positions in the context of this dialogue. However, some memories, like Speaker B being a workaholic or Speaker A's dreams, are less directly relevant to the specific topic being discussed. The details are somewhat connected, but the overall flow and direct causality or relevancy to the ongoing topic in the context could be clearer."
