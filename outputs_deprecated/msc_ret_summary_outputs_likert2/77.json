Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights.\n2. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\n3. Speaker B found flights that work for their schedule and price and will be visiting Speaker A in a couple of weeks.\n4. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n5. Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n6. Speaker B is interested in going whale watching and asks about a wolf petting zoo.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I found some flights that work for my schedule and budget. I'll be visiting you in a couple of weeks!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides a comprehensive and well-organized account of the plans surrounding Speaker B's visit, which are directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory entries build on each other, with Speaker A initially inviting Speaker B and the latter subsequently arranging flights. It mentions the excitement about the trip, specific activities planned during the visit, and additional interests expressed by Speaker B. This detailed and coherent information is crucial for Speaker B (the language model) to generate an appropriate and contextually aware response to Speaker A's question about looking for tickets. The sequence of events is naturally connected, demonstrating relevancy and causality between past interactions and planned activities."
