Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "raw_prediction": "The new deli it is! I can't wait to try it out. I'll see you at the pool this weekend too, it will be fun!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It indicates that Speaker B is involved with karate, which is directly relevant to the conversation about martial arts. Additionally, Speaker B's involvement in lifeguarding is mentioned, which connects to the part of the context where Speaker B offers guest passes to the pool. However, there are details in the MEMORY that are not directly relevant to the current dialogue, such as Speaker B's career aspirations, background in football, and Speaker A's love for seafood, which do not contribute to the development of the dialogue or the planning of meeting arrangements. While sentences related to karate and lifeguarding are generally helpful, the unrelated memories make the overall helpfulness moderate."
