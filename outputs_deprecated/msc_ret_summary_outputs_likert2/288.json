Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar. Speaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general? Speaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts. Speaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts? Speaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.  Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately? Speaker A: Water skiing? Yes, last weekend. It was so much fun! Speaker B: (sorry my typing sucks)  That's awesome. I wish had access to a boat, but who knows, maybe one day.  Speaker A: Boating is so fun. You could go wakeboarding more often if you had your own boat. And no more boat rental fees or hassle.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is excited to join Speaker A's family for a water skiing trip and wants to learn from Speaker A's kids.\n2. Speaker A loves boating and water sports, mentioning that they are better at water skiing than wakeboarding.\n3. Speaker B expresses interest in trying water skiing next.\n4. Speaker A has been water skiing for 15 years and has 3 kids who also water ski.\n5. Speaker B enjoys snowboarding but will focus on wakeboarding as summer approaches.\n6. Speaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I agree, having your own boat would be amazing. Maybe one day we can all go out on the water together!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly regarding the water skiing and boating interests of both speakers. Sentence 1 and 3 are connected to Speaker B's expression of interest in water skiing in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 2 is relevant as it ties to Speaker A's love for boating, which is mentioned in the context. Sentence 4 adds depth to Speaker A's experience, which could be useful for Speaker B's interest. Sentence 5, however, feels less connected as snowboarding and wakeboarding were not directly discussed. Sentence 6 is relevant as it connects to the jello-making tradition mentioned by Speaker B but inaccurately attributes it to Speaker A. The sentences are somewhat connected but lack a strong causal linkage or flow, which prevents a higher score."
