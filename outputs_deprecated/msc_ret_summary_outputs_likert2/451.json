Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. Speaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price? Speaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music Speaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it. Speaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately? Speaker B: No I haven't! I keep hoping that I will so I can buy my dreamhouse but I know the chances are low. Speaker A: Would you move to the city? It'd be too much for me Speaker B: I would love to be able to have a country house and a city house to be able to come and go to each one as I please. doesn't that sound like a dream come true? Speaker A: It would be convenient for seeing concerts in the city, yes. I'm not used to the business, though Speaker B: Yeah I understand that. Have you listened to any new blues songs lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n2. Both speakers dream of having a city and country house or a summer and winter home.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n4. Speaker B appreciates the convenience of city living but also values what the country has to offer.\n5. Both speakers acknowledge the pros and cons of city and country living.\n6. Speaker A lives on a farm and is inviting Speaker B and their kids to attend a Quaker City Night Hawks concert.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I have! I recently discovered a new band called Quaker City Night Hawks. Their sound is amazing, would you be interested in going to one of their concerts with me?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided has several elements that are somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the conversation about wanting to win the lotto and having city and country homes, which aligns with Speaker B's dream of having both. This indicates some helpfulness in generating a response that could naturally follow the dialogue. However, MEMORY also includes less relevant details, such as Speaker A inviting Speaker B to a concert, which is not explicitly connected to the ongoing conversation about music or location preferences. The connectedness between the MEMORY sentences and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is moderate but could be improved for a higher score, as some sentences in MEMORY don't directly contribute to the observed dialogue flow."
