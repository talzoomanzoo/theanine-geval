Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n2. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n3. Speaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\n4. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n5. Speaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful details that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B going on a trip (memory 1) and their excitement about spring break (memory 4). These details are relevant as Speaker B mentions their trip to Costa Rica in the conversation. Snippets about travel plans, excitement around the trip, and plans during the break all connect logically. However, certain details, like Speaker B receiving a new car (memory 5) or Speaker A's concern about gas mileage (memory 3), aren't directly relevant to the current topic of plane tickets and Costa Rica trip. Some memories, such as the shared sense of humor (memory 6), don't provide direct utility in generating the next response about the trip plans. Hence, the memories collectively are partially but not entirely helpful."
