Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping? Speaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp? Speaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer? Speaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures.\n2. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n3. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n4. Speaker A is offering advice and seems to have experience with children.\n5. Speaker B just moved to America and is unfamiliar with the places.\n6. Speaker B is interested in finding family discounts for the zoo.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "We have a camper trailer that we use for camping. It's great because we can leave our kitten back at the camper while we go out exploring during our family camping adventures.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides several potential clues about Speaker B's interests and background, which could be useful for generating future conversational turns. Points 1 and 6 suggest that Speaker B has both a familial interest and practical considerations in planning activities, which aligns with the dialogue's theme about camping trips. However, many points in the MEMORY are unrelated to the camping topic discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which limits their immediate usefulness. Further, while the MEMORY describes connections between Speaker B's interest in the zoo, family concerns, and recent moves, these connections might not be directly relevant to generating responses about camping. The relevance of these connections could improve or depreciate, depending on future conversation directions, but they are semi-related with current context and that's why this memory is rated as a 3 on helpfulness."
