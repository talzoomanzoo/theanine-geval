Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. Speaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk? Speaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is an artist who walks through nature for work.\n2. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n3. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n4. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks.\n5. Speaker A enjoys reading sci-fi and mysteries, while Speaker B prefers fantasy books.\n6. Speaker A asks about Speaker B's new artwork and acknowledges their need for inspiration.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds lovely! Sometimes the easy trails can be just as rewarding, especially when you just need a peaceful walk to clear your mind. Did you see any interesting wildlife along the river?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful insights about Speaker B that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights Speaker B's connection to nature, love for nature walks, and how they utilize nature walks for work and artistic inspiration (points 1, 3, and 4). This background information can help Speaker B generate a more engaging and contextually informed response about nature walks or how they find inspiration from such activities. This is especially relevant since the current dialogue is about a nature walk taken by Speaker A. However, the MEMORY could tie these elements together more cohesively to demonstrate clearer causality. A slightly clearer link, for instance, between Speaker Bâ€™s appreciation for nature and their artistic endeavors, or how this context influences their interaction with Speaker A, would improve the rating to a 5."
