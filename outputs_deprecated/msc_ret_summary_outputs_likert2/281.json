Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition.\n2. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n3. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n4. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n5. Speaker B regrets not having the opportunity to spend quality time with their grandparents, who were busy running a grocery store before they passed away.\n6. Speaker B does not do a lot of cooking or baking but is interested in learning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's wonderful that you're passing on your grandmother's jello recipe to your kids! Maybe you could find a way to make a healthier version with less sugar so you can still enjoy it together. It's all about creating new memories while honoring the old ones.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, capturing the shared appreciation of family traditions and the connection to jello recipes from grandparents. Sentences 1, 2, and 4 directly relate to the tradition of making jello as mentioned by Speaker B in the context and can be relevant in continuing the conversation. Sentence 6 could help develop Speaker A's response by acknowledging Speaker B's interest in cooking. However, the lack of direct causality or deep connection between the memories and the current context reduces its overall helpfulness. Sentences 3 and 5, while meaningful, are less directly relevant to the immediate conversation about teaching kids and jello recipes."
