Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?   Speaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere! Speaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n2. Speaker A loves animals, especially puppies, and visits shelters in every city they go to.\n3. Speaker B is interested in volunteering and prefers cats over dogs, especially kittens.\n4. Speaker A enjoys grilling indoors and suggests grilled asparagus with lemon on it.\n5. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters.\n6. Speaker A is busy with work and used to foster puppies but no longer does.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences in the MEMORY give insights into Speaker A's love for animals, particularly puppies, which is relevant to the initial part of the conversation about the cuteness of puppies. It also ties in with the part of the dialogue where different preferences for animals are discussed, providing Speaker B's preference for cats which could guide conversation. Additionally, the MEMORY contains information about Speaker A's interest in cooking, specifically grilling, and provides a concrete recipe suggestion (grilled asparagus with lemon), which is pertinent considering the topic switch by Speaker B to asparagus recipes. The sentences in the MEMORY are naturally connected, presenting clear relevance and causality to the ongoing DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, since not all information in the MEMORY is directly applicable to the current conversation (such as Speaker A's past foster experience or Speaker B's volunteering interest), it does not achieve a perfect score."
