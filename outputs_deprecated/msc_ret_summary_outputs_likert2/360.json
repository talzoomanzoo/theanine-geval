Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha! Speaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes? Speaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n3. Speaker A does not have any pets and expresses an interest in scuba diving.\n4. Speaker A is interested in scuba diving and neuroscience, with experience in a research lab.\n5. Speaker A's interest in neuroscience was further fueled by their experience in a research lab and being in the Eagle Scouts.\n6. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fascinating! It's interesting to see how your passion for science extends beyond just your studies. Have you ever thought about studying reptiles in a research setting?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information that could be used to generate a relevant response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically the information about Speaker B having two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel, which is directly related to the current conversation. Additionally, it includes content about Speaker A's interests in scuba diving and neuroscience, which can potentially be incorporated into the conversation if the topic shifts towards hobbies or interests. However, the MEMORY also contains information that is not immediately relevant to generating the next response, such as the details about Speaker A's experience in the Eagle Scouts and their volunteering at a lab. Furthermore, the connection between the sentences in the MEMORY is not very strong, as they address different topics without a clear link to the current dialogue. Overall, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but lacks coherence and strong relevance to the ongoing discussion about pet snakes."
