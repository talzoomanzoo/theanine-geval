Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make? Speaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\n2. Speaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally.\n3. Speaker A enjoys cooking and finds it helpful for stress relief.\n4. Speaker A plays the drums and loves making food for others.\n5. Speaker A cooked steak, fried potatoes, and shrimp for dinner with their father.\n6. Speaker B's grandmother was the matriarch of the family, known for cooking large meals for family gatherings.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds amazing! I love spicy fried rice. I'd love to come over and try your cooking sometime. Cooking and sharing meals with loved ones always brings back good memories.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several useful pieces of information that could help Speaker A, a language model, to generate a relevant response. The first entry connects well to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as it explains Speaker B's appreciation for their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe, which is relevant since garlic chicken was mentioned in the conversation. The MEMORY also highlights Speaker B's love for cooking for loved ones and the significance of cooking in their family, which could help in developing conversations around cooking and sharing meals. Furthermore, it mentions Speaker A's interest in cooking as stress relief, and their love for making food for others, which resonates with the current topic of cooking. Although some of the information, like Speaker A playing drums, may not be immediately relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, the MEMORY as a whole provides well-structured and connected information that portrays the causal connection and relevance between the pairs' interests in cooking."
