Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes.  Speaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me. Speaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n2. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n3. Speaker B works at a Raccoon Cafe and takes care of Bandicoot, a raccoon.\n4. Speaker A has not interacted closely with raccoons but admires them.\n5. Speaker B considers raccoons intelligent and funny.\n6. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I completely understand your concern. It's always better to be cautious, especially with wild animals. Just make sure to secure those holes properly with the aluminum sheeting, and hopefully, your raccoon problem will be a thing of the past.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful information for generating a suitable response in the context of a conversation about dealing with raccoon problems. The memory mentions that Speaker A is dealing with raccoons and is using aluminum sheeting, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Furthermore, it reveals Speaker B's experiences and attitude towards raccoons, mentioning the raccoon named Bandicoot and highlighting their intelligence, which supports understanding Speaker B's suggestion to befriend raccoons. While the memory could better emphasize the direct connection between the cafe work and Bandicoot, it is relatively cohesive and relevant, offering pertinent insights into both speakers' perspectives and past interactions."
