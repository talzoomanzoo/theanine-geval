Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods. Speaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about? Speaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America. Have you seen any of those movies? Speaker B: No I haven't seen any of those. What foods did you eat while watching the movie? Speaker A: Wow, there are so many of the movies out there. Don't go see Black Widow without watching Avengers first. I had an amazing steak and vegetables on the side that were delicious. What is you favorite food?  Speaker B: Oh ok I definitely will watch those first! I love both steak and vegetables! I am a real foodie and love just about everything that isn't too strange to try lol. Speaker A: Oh wow! Do you like sushi? I love it but the sea urchin is a little crazy lol. Have you ever eaten sea urchin? Speaker B: I have never tried sea urchin or sushi but I do like crab legs and shrimp! Do you ever consider any foods to be good for healing? I find that you do healing very fascinating! Speaker A: Yes, in fact I consider almost all foods to either be healing, harmful or neutral. In my opinion people should choose foods based on how they want to feel. Sushi is fresh and healthy so I considerate it to be very healing.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B expressed interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A.\n2. Speaker A is involved in healing work and mentioned hot latina salsa.\n3. Speaker A recommended self-massage, essential oils, reiki, meditation, and self-awareness for healing.\n4. Speaker A's brother enjoys Brazilian food, specifically steak.\n5.

    "raw_prediction": "That's a really interesting perspective on food! I'll have to keep that in mind the next time I choose what to eat. Thanks for sharing your thoughts on healing through food.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information, such as Speaker A's involvement in healing work and their recommendations for healing methods, which aligns with Speaker B's interest in healing foods. However, memory points such as Speaker A's mention of salsa and visits to a Brazilian steakhouse with their brother are not directly relevant to the current context. While these details could provide deeper conversational elements if further explored, they are not directly useful for generating the immediate next response based on the dialogue. Moreover, some connections, such as the development from discussing movies to healing foods, lack sufficient transition or causal linkage within the memory to be considered highly helpful for advancing the current conversation."
