Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work? Speaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol Speaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise?  Speaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows. Speaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity.  Speaker B: Yes, I agree. What kind of hours would this new job have? Speaker A: It's third shift, which isn't the greatest, but it pays a bit more than the other shifts, and I think I'll like getting off early in the morning. Then I can just go down and get in my hammock and have a nice relaxing moment after work. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker A is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock.\n3. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking, mentioning setting up a hammock at their campsite.\n4. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n5. Speaker A plans to leave a hammock by the river for anyone to use at a hidden spot off the main hiking trail.\n6. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a nice way to unwind after a shift. I hope the new job works out well for you. It seems like a good fit with your love for hiking and camping.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY includes several pieces of information that are somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it mentions Speaker A's application to a grocery store, which is directly relevant. It also touches upon Speaker A's enjoyment of hiking and interest in a hammock, which ties back to their statement about liking solitary activities and using a hammock as a relaxing moment after work. However, some details are not directly helpful or connected, such as Speaker A's recent high school graduate status or leaving a hammock by the river for others, which do not add much to developing the immediate context of the dialogue. The MEMORY could benefit from more focused details and stronger connections to be more helpful."
