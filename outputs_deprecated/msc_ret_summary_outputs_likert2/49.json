Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career. Speaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday. Speaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. Speaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach? Speaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n4. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n5. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n6. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great that you have multiple interests to consider! You could always find a way to incorporate both English and history into your teaching. It's all about finding what you're passionate about.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several pieces of information that could be relevant for generating a continuation of the dialogue. For instance, it clarifies that Speaker A has an interest in both teaching and computer science, which aligns with teaching robotics. Similarly, Speaker B's main interest in linguistics and the consideration of a college professor career is somewhat connected to their interest in teaching English from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, not all pieces of MEMORY are directly beneficial in continuing the current conversation, such as Speaker A working at a pizza shop or developing apps for differently abled youth, as these details don't clearly connect to the teaching career discussion at hand. The information about feeling limited in job opportunities also loosely ties back to the career decisions discussed but doesn't add much new detail. Overall, the MEMORY contains relevant elements but could be more streamlined or directly aligned with the dialogue context for a higher score."
