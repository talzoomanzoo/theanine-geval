Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences.\n3. Speaker A relies on Speaker B for movie suggestions, mentioning a preference for comedies.\n4. Speaker B enjoys watching suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy.\n5. Speaker B used to teach Film Studies and carefully chooses what movies to watch.\n6. Speaker A enjoyed the movie \"Coming to America\" and expressed interest in watching its sequel.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a comprehensive background for Speaker B to respond naturally and pertinently to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes:\n\n1. Speaker A's interest in movies, specifically mentioning \"Pulp Fiction\" and their appreciation for Speaker B's recommendation (Memory 1).\n2. Speaker Bâ€™s ability to give informed movie recommendations due to their past teaching experience in Film Studies (Memory 2 and 5).\n3. Speaker A's general preferences for movies, including their liking for comedies (Memory 3 and 6).\n4. Speaker B's preferences for various movie genres, suggesting a well-rounded knowledge for providing recommendations (Memory 4).\n\nThe connection in MEMORY between Speaker A's preferences and Speaker B's expertise allows Speaker B to potentially give more tailored movie recommendations in response to the context, demonstrating a clear causality and relevance. However, some MEMORY points (like 6) could be expanded to relate more directly to \"Pulp Fiction\", which might enhance the coherence even further, hence a score of 4 instead of 5."
