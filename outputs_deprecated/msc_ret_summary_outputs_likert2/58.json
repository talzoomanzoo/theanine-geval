Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping? Speaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp? Speaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures.\n2. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n3. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n4. Speaker B is away from their child and glad that the pets are with them.\n5. Speaker B is interested in finding family discounts for the zoo.\n6. Speaker A is offering advice and seems to have experience with children.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I prefer camping in a tent for the authentic outdoor experience. Have you ever considered bringing your kitten along on your camping trips?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information but lacks coherence in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during camping, which ties into the context of the camping conversation. However, other points, such as the school field trip to the zoo and the search for family discounts, are not clearly connected to the dialogue about camping preferences. The MEMORY does not fully develop a meaningful connection between past interactions and the current conversation context, making it less helpful for generating an appropriate next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
