Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A does not have any pets and expresses an interest in scuba diving.\n3. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n4. Speaker B prefers animals to humans but acknowledges the importance of curing diseases.\n5. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n6. Speaker B goes to Hawaii for scuba diving and is considering studying marine life or a different type of animal.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful in generating a response for the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n- The mention of Speaker B having two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel directly relates to the context where Speaker B inquires about the snakes. This is helpful as it provides specific details about Speaker B's pets.\n  \n- The MEMORY also offers insight into Speaker A's interests, namely scuba diving and volunteering at a lab, which may not directly relate to the immediate context but could inform future conversations or responses.\n  \n- The comments on Speaker B preferring animals over humans and considering studying marine life could be relevant if the conversation expands beyond the pet snakes to broader topics like animal interests or studies. However, these parts are somewhat tangential to the immediate question about the pet snakes.\n\nOverall, MEMORY includes relevant components regarding Speaker B's pet snakes and some potentially useful details about the speakers' interests. However, there is not a clear causality or direct connection between all memory points and the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT, hence a middle-tier score."
