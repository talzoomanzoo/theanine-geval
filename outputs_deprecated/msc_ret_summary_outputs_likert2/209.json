Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice.  Speaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with? Speaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n2. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n3. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n4. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n5. Speaker A has given a pressure cooker as a gift and uses it for recipes like lamb shanks.\n6. Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! I'll definitely give it a try. Thank you for the suggestion.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides relevant information for Speaker Bâ€™s interest in cooking and the use of a pressure cooker, which is directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It helps explain why Speaker A would suggest recipes like shrimp fried rice and emphasizes the ease and efficiency of using a pressure cooker. The MEMORY also indicates Speaker B's lack of experience and interest in learning, which aligns with her appreciation of simple recipes. Additionally, it highlights Speaker A's expertise, which supports the context where Speaker A suggests recipes to Speaker B. However, the MEMORY could be more useful with direct past interactions or examples of successful recommendations to demonstrate the development and connection between their interactions. Thus, a score of 4 is given, as the sentences are helpful and relatively connected to the context, but not perfectly demonstrating causality or prior interactions.\n"
