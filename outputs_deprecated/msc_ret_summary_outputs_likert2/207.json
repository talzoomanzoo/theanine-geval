Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n2. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n3. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n4. Speaker A has given a pressure cooker as a gift and uses it for recipes like lamb shanks.\n5. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n6. Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY is highly relevant and helpful for generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides a clear understanding of Speaker B's situation: her husband is an avid cook who enjoys cooking Asian food (1), while Speaker B herself is interested in learning how to cook with a pressure cooker (3). It also outlines that Speaker A is experienced in using a pressure cooker and cooks Indian food (6), which matches the context of suggesting Asian recipes using a pressure cooker (5). The memory entries are naturally connected and show causality, as Speaker A's expertise and recommendations can motivate Speaker B to be inspired in her cooking endeavors, potentially with encouragement from her husband's cooking interests. All these details align well with the interactions and provide helpful context for Speaker B's next response."
