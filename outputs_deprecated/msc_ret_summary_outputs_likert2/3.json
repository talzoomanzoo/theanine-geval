Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there? Speaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay? Speaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n2. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n3. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n4. Speaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\n5. Speaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\n6. Speaker A, a retired librarian, recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains pieces of information related to Speaker A and Speaker B's previous interactions, such as Speaker B's plans for an adventurous spring break and their excitement about it, including their new car. However, these details are only somewhat relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about traveling to Costa Rica. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it connected directly to the current context, like past travel experiences or book recommendations. Overall, the provided information has some potential to influence the continuation of the dialogue, such as recommending travel books or discussing travel plans, but does not strongly connect events or establish clear causality in the current conversation."
