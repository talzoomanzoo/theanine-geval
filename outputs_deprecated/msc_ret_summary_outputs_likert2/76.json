Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it! Speaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to? Speaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you? Speaker B: I have been relaxing with the kids as much as I have. My husband has been busy with work, so we haven't had time for anything big. I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before? Speaker A: I have never gone to Italy because I'm always so busy. If I ever go, I would want to spend a month there, but work has been hectic lately. Would your kids go with you if you went to Italy? Speaker B: Absolutely! I'd love to travel all over the world with my family to see everything. Hawaii sounds like just as much fun though. What are you most excited about doing when you get there? Speaker A: I'm extremely excited about the sunset tour. Each day is at a new location to watch the sunset. It's suppose to be romantic, but I am just going alone, so I see it as more calming than anything. Speaker B: I hope you have a lot fun. It sounds like a nice time to get away from everything. You should eat as much of the local Hawaiian food as you can. Have you had Hawaiian food before? I think it's great. Speaker A: No, I acctually haven't. I'm expecting pineapple and ham on everything, but I know they will having some amazing cultural food that is probably going to blow my mind! Is there a specific dish you would recommend Speaker B: I enjoy foods like Spam musubi, loco mocos, and poi. My favorite might be kalua pork. The way they prepare the pig makes it taste so good. Speaker A: That all sounds really good, I will check it out. I saved up a lot of money to splurge on everything. I'm excited to walk the beach, even though I hate the beach.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has booked a \"Hawaii Sunset\" tour for next month, being excited about it being their first time.\n2. Speaker A has seen the Disney movie 'Luca' recently.\n3. Speaker B's kids enjoyed watching 'Luca' and said it was good.\n4. Speaker A works two jobs and struggles to make time for themselves, but still manages to plan a trip to Hawaii.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy sunsets and movies, with Speaker A preferring the beach for watching sunsets.\n6. Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It sounds like you have a great trip planned out! Even if you hate the beach, the sunset views will definitely make up for it. Enjoy every moment of your time in Hawaii, and make sure to try all the delicious food they have to offer. It's going to be an unforgettable experience for you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that could be useful for Speaker B to generate a proper next response. However, it lacks coherence and some of the entries don't contribute significantly to the dialogue context while some repetitive information is present. \n\n1. The first and second points are relevant as they describe recent activities of Speaker A that have been discussed in the dialogue.\n2. The information about Speaker B's kids enjoying Disney movies is partially correct because the context doesn't specify that they watched 'Luca' together; instead, it refers to another Disney movie, 'Miracle.'\n3. The fourth point provides a deeper insight about Speaker A, which wasn't explicitly stated in the dialogue context, but it can still be pertinent for engaging in conversation.\n4. The fifth and sixth points do not align completely with the dialogue context. Specifically, there is no explicit mention or preference for watching sunsets on the beach by Speaker A in the context. Additionally, the last point could be deduced but is overly general, without adding substantial value.\n   \nOverall, while the MEMORY provides fragments of helpful information, the connections between the dialogue context and MEMORY are not smoothly established, lacking some critical context that would ensure a higher score."
