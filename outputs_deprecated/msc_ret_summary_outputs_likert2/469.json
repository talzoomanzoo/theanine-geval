Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer? Speaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to? Speaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors? Speaker B: Yes. That way they could have a fireworks show too. I love fireworks. Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle? Speaker A: No, but I have been to Disney World in Florida.  I love fireworks too.  I want to get married on the 4th of July.  That was we will have a national holiday and fireworks for us every year!  It sounds like you've been to Disneyland? Speaker B: No, but I thought you might have since you lived in LA for awhile. Did you get to see any live Disney music performances while you were at Disney World?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A loves Disney music.\n2. Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods.\n3. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo.\n4. Speaker B enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food and live music.\n5. Speaker B has seen Three Dog Night in concert and enjoys their live shows.\n6. Speaker A used to live in Los Angeles.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that may help Speaker A in generating a response. For instance, it notes that Speaker A used to live in Los Angeles, which directly connects to the ongoing conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Disney and living in LA. Additionally, it mentions Speaker A's interest in music concerts and Speaker B's enjoyment of live music, which is pertinent given the discussion about concerts and Disney music performances. However, not all details in the MEMORY directly enhance the conversation or lead to a more developed interaction based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the information about planning a trip to Sao Paulo or general preferences for food and museums, which are not directly relevant to this specific dialogue. Overall, while MEMORY has some useful connections, it could offer deeper or more directly relevant insights to earn a higher score."
