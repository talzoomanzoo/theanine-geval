Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim.  Speaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n2. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n3. Speaker B is looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing.\n4. Speaker A knows how to swim since the age of 5.\n5. Speaker B does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies.\n6. Speaker A finds swimming relaxing and uses it to destress from their job.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful and relevant information for Speaker B to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It offers details about Speaker B's interest in punk music, which aligns with the playlist mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, MEMORY points out that Speaker B does not know how to swim but is interested in learning, which is relevant to the context where Speaker A offers to teach swimming. Furthermore, the MEMORY mentions Speaker A's experience with swimming, supporting their ability to teach. These connections are naturally related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, some elements like the desire to eat a pizza burger in a pool might be a bit less relevant, which slightly reduces the overall cohesiveness. Hence, it is not a perfect 5, but still a strong 4 in terms of relevance and connection."
