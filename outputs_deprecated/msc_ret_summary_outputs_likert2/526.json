Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing? Speaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from? Speaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there. Speaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat?  Speaker A: I've thought of a lot of  names, but in the end it will probably depend on the breed and the sex.   Speaker B: That's true. Is pilates hard? I've always wanted to try it but I don't know if it will be too difficult. Speaker A: No, I don't think it's hard.  I actually enjoy it.  It's more fun than work, at least to me. You should give it a try! Speaker B: Maybe I will. Do you think I can start at home by watching Youtube videos, or do I need to go to a Pilates class?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n2. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy the company of their pets and think they are smart and playful.\n3. Speaker A is considering getting kittens and thinks rats can be smart.\n4. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets.\n5. Speaker A reads a novel a week, lives in the city, and goes to pilates class.\n6. Speaker B is in college, paints on the side, and has five dogs and three rats.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Both options could work, but I think going to a class with an instructor might be better for proper form and guidance. Plus, it's always nice to have a group setting for motivation and support.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some potentially relevant information, like Speaker A's involvement in pilates classes and Speaker B's interest in painting, which have tangential connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the sentences are not tightly connected to form a clear narrative or causal/relational structure that could significantly aid in generating the next response. The points about pets and painting are not directly helpful for the current dialogue topic of exploring pilates options at home or in a class. Also, some memory details, such as Speaker B's painting preferences or Speaker A's reading habits, do not add relevant context for generating a more informed response in the dialogue. The scattered and unrelated nature of the details reduces the memory's helpfulness."
