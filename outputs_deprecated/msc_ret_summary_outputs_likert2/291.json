Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n2. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n3. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n4. Speaker B plays Resident Evil VIII alone in the dark to make it scarier.\n5. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n6.

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I actually played a lot of Resident Evil VIII this week. It's such a thrilling game, especially when played in the dark.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that can aid in generating a response for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A asks about playing Resident Evil. The MEMORY clarifies that Speaker A and Speaker B have a shared interest in video games, with specific mention of Resident Evil. It notes Speaker A's hesitance but potential interest, connecting to their inquiry. Speaker B's familiarity and enjoyment of Resident Evil VIII, along with providing tips earlier, can naturally lead to suggestions or sharing experiences in a response. The information is connected logically, reflecting causality in their interactions, though it could offer deeper insights into past specific Resident Evil discussions."
