Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended.  Speaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n2. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n3. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot.\n4. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n5. Speaker B has two sick kitties and recently received a rescue.\n6. Speaker A suggested the name Zhao for one of the kittens.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been doing some research on introducing cats to birds. I think with some proper training and supervision, they can coexist peacefully.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that could be useful for generating a next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 2 reiterate that Speaker A has a parrot and is looking into adopting a rescue kitten, which aligns with the current context of the conversation about kittens and pets. However, these sentences are somewhat redundant. Sentence 3 could be useful if the conversation steers toward training or managing pets. Sentence 4 contains details about Speaker B's adoption plans and potential naming ideas but isn't directly connected to the ongoing conversation other than the mention of names. Sentence 5 about the sick kitties introduces additional context but doesn't directly impact the current dialogue. Sentence 6 might be relevant if the dialogue shifts to discussing kitten names more extensively. Overall, while some connections with DIALOGUE CONTEXT exist, the MEMORY's connections are somewhat scattered and not as cohesive or directly impactful as they could be for producing a next response."
