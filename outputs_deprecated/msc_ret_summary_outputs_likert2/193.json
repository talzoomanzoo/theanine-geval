Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A. Speaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now? Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done.  Speaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on? Speaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study? Speaker B: Ah, English should be easier than History. Sure, I can help you. What do you need to do exactly? Write an essay? Speaker A: Yeah, we have to write an essay and we have a spelling component towards the end of the exam, I sure could use a little help!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n2. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n3. Speaker A wishes to get better grades and is hopeful for a soccer scholarship.\n4. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n5. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n6. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some relevant information, such as Speaker A's struggles with history class, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions not having the best history teacher and being satisfied with a B grade. However, most of the information in the MEMORY is unrelated to the current context of English exams, like details about sports medicine which don't aid in developing responses concerning the English exam or the help Speaker B is going to provide. Additionally, while Speaker A's struggle in maintaining good grades could help, there is limited causal connection between these struggles and assistance for English, which reduces the helpfulness of MEMORY in crafting relevant responses to the specific context of preparing for the English exam with Speaker B's help."
