Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it? Speaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see.  Speaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself? Speaker B: I was in Greece last two years ago.   I am excited to go again soon!    At somepoint I would like to take a cruise around the islands there.  It seems like a neat way to see all the Islands in an easy way.   Have you ever taken a cruise? Speaker A: Only once before when I was very young, so I don't remember much. It sounds like such a relaxing way to enjoy the day, though. Maybe we can plan a cruise together sometime. Speaker B: That would be fun!  I go to Europe a lot so maybe a cruise in the Caribbean would be nice.  I would like to see Saint Lucia and Saint Thomas. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five.\n2. Speaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece.\n3. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\n4. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian.\n5. Speaker B asks Speaker A if their trip is more for relaxation or sightseeing.\n6. Speaker A has traveled around Europe before, visiting capital cities of each country.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a fantastic idea! I've never been to the Caribbean, so it would be a great opportunity to explore those beautiful islands with you. Let's start planning our next adventure together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about Speaker B's interest in Greece and their recommendations for places to visit. However, it contains inaccuracies (e.g., Speaker B has been to Greece before, not visiting for the first time, as stated in the MEMORY). Also, the MEMORY lacks a clear connection to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, especially regarding relevance to planning a cruise or discussing past cruises, which are prominent topics in the conversation. Furthermore, the information about Speaker A's European travel history is not directly tied to the immediate dialogue about Greece or cruise plans, making the MEMORY less helpful for generating a relevant response. Overall, while there are potentially useful elements, the inaccuracies and lack of connection to the conversation reduce its helpfulness."
