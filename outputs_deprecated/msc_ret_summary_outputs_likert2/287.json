Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar. Speaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general? Speaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts. Speaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts? Speaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.  Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately? Speaker A: Water skiing? Yes, last weekend. It was so much fun! Speaker B: (sorry my typing sucks)  That's awesome. I wish had access to a boat, but who knows, maybe one day. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is excited to join Speaker A's family for a water skiing trip and wants to learn from Speaker A's kids.\n2. Speaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition.\n3. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n4. Speaker A has been water skiing for 15 years and has 3 kids who also water ski.\n5. Speaker B expresses interest in trying water skiing next.\n6. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that could be helpful in generating the next response for Speaker A in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, points 1, 4, and 5 are related to the topic of water skiing, which is part of the ongoing conversation. This provides a basis for Speaker A to further engage with Speaker B about water skiing, sharing experiences, or offering advice and encouragement.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY also contains unrelated or less relevant information (points 2, 3, and 6) that do not directly connect to the current discussion about skiing or baking. Additionally, these points are somewhat repetitive and do not offer new insights or developments that could enrich the dialogue. Furthermore, the MEMORY lacks an established connection or causality that seamlessly ties the points together in relation to the ongoing conversation. This limits its overall helpfulness in guiding the next response meaningfully."
