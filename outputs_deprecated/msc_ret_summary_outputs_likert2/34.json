Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.\n2. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate.\n3. Speaker B practices karate and works as a lifeguard but is looking for a different career.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both have interests in learning new languages.\n5. Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork.\n6. Speaker A has taken Spanish classes in the past and finds similarities between French and Spanish.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I've actually been considering taking up karate myself! I think it would be a great way to stay active and learn some self-defense techniques.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful for Speaker A to generate a proper next response in the context of discussing martial arts and classes. The MEMORY includes details about Speaker B's karate practice, background in football, and interest in education, which could be relevant for the conversation. However, the MEMORY also contains information about language learning and career interests that doesn't directly connect to the current dialogue context. While some parts like karate practice and sports background help create a fuller picture of Speaker B's interests, the degree of connection and relevance to the immediate topic of martial arts and class-taking is somewhat limited, hence a rating in the middle range."
