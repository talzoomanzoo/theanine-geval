Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand. Speaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  Speaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery Speaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library?  Speaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done Speaker B: Well if you ever need someone to come and help for a couple of hours here and there, give me a call, you know how much I love to be in the library anyway\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a retired librarian who enjoys implementing creative activities in their library.\n2. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n3. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n4. Speaker A sees parents bringing in their little kids to the library as encouraging.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B agree on the importance of reading and the value of libraries, despite the rise of the internet.\n6. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you so much for the offer, that means a lot to me. I will definitely keep that in mind for when things get even busier. Your help would be greatly appreciated.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a good amount of relevant information that can assist Speaker A in generating coherent next responses based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Here’s a breakdown of the relevance and helpfulness of each point in the MEMORY:\n\n1. The detail about Speaker A being a retired librarian is not directly relevant as the context shows Speaker A is currently working at the library.\n2. Speaker B’s enjoyment of spending time with grandkids, mentioned in the MEMORY, aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they discuss spending time with their grandkids and the fishing trip.\n3. The fishing trip as an annual tradition is mentioned, connecting well to the suggestion in the context to plan trips with different locations.\n4. The encouragement Speaker A feels seeing parents with kids in the library doesn't directly connect to the current dialogue.\n5. The shared value of libraries and reading supports the context where they discuss work at the library and general attitudes towards it.\n6. The information about Speaker A having kids and being busy with work links to the context where they lament about the demanding nature of their job.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY includes several points that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and could support further interaction, but there are a few points that don't align perfectly, preventing a perfect score."
