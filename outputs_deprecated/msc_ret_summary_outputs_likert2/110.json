Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position.  Speaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys playing soccer but is not into music.\n2. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n3. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n4. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n5. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n6. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains useful information that could benefit Speaker B's responses in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Several elements of this MEMORY, such as Speaker B's history with soccer and connection to Manchester United, could be relevant if the conversation shifts to favorite teams or personal soccer experiences. Although not all sentences are directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT (such as Speaker A's music preferences), the memory pieces concerning soccer connect naturally and provide enough context to enable Speaker B to contribute insightfully about their college soccer experiences and preferences in teams, supporting a natural flow of conversation."
