Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there? Speaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n2. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n3. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n4. Speaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\n5. Speaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context for understanding the Past interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B, with specific details that could inform a proper next response. For example, it mentions Speaker B's excitement about spring break and Easter weekend, which could be relevant to continuing the conversation about travel and plans. Additionally, the mention of Speaker B receiving a new car and planning to drive could tie into their travel plans. However, several details, such as Speaker A's concerns about gas mileage or the contrasting spring breaks, do not directly connect with the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Speaker B's upcoming trip to Costa Rica. Furthermore, some of the sentences don't establish a clear causality or relevance to the current conversation. Therefore, while the MEMORY contains useful elements, it could be structured in a more focused manner to enhance its helpfulness."
