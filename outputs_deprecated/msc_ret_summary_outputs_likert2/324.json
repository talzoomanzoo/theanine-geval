Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n2. Speaker A hears raccoons and cats fighting in their neighborhood.\n3. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n4. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n5. Speaker A has not interacted closely with raccoons but admires them.\n6. Speaker B considers raccoons intelligent and funny.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that can be used to generate a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to use aluminum sheeting to block holes, which directly relates to the dialogue context. The MEMORY also includes Speaker B's positive stance on raccoons, considering them to be good pets and intelligent, which may influence a supportive or advisory response from Speaker B. However, there is minimal natural connection or causality demonstrated between the interactions of the speakers in MEMORY, so there's a slight gap in demonstrating the flow of their past conversations, which prevents it from being rated as a 5."
