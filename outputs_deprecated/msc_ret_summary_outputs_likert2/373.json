Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. Speaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?   Speaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone. Speaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you? Speaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know. Speaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient!  Speaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession.\n2. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n3. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n4. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n5. Speaker A works at a stable and enjoys being around horses.\n6. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I would be more than happy to see you as a client. As a therapist, I always maintain professionalism and confidentiality, so our friendship wouldn't be a conflict of interest. It's important to prioritize your mental health, so if you feel like therapy could be beneficial for you, I'm here to help.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides information that is generally helpful for Speaker B to generate a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY mentions that Speaker B is a therapist, which aligns well with Speaker B's role in the conversation. It also notes Speaker B's experience of working in their own practice for about six years, which substantiates Speaker B's credibility and explains why they might offer to see Speaker A for therapy. Additionally, the MEMORY highlights Speaker B's interest in the psychological aspects of owning a horse, which could be relevant given Speaker A's mention of finding therapy in riding horses. \n\nHowever, some details in the MEMORY, such as Speaker B being a football fan supporting the Chiefs and Speaker A mainly knowing about horses and not much about psychology, are less directly relevant to generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These aspects don't strongly connect to the immediate exchange between the speakers. Despite this, the MEMORY contains coherent connections relevant to the context and can be useful for understanding the situation better."
