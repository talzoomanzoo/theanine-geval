Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin! Speaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name?  Speaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls! \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n2. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n3. Speaker A has a kitten from their cat and enjoys taking them on trips.\n4. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted and humorous conversation about their pets and travels.\n6. Speaker A enjoys drinking tea and water.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Haha, the Spice Girls of the cat world! Pumpkin and Ginger, what a pair. Maybe I should start naming the strays that show up at my door after my favorite snacks.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically indicating Speaker A's history with their pets and the humorous nature of conversations between Speaker A and B. This helps provide context for the playful interaction around naming the kitten Pumpkin. However, the MEMORY could be more directly relevant to the specific name change discussion, as it mainly mentions past considerations and general pet-related interactions. Some details, like Speaker B's experiences with stray cats and Speaker Aâ€™s beverage preferences, are less relevant to the current dialogue topic. Additionally, while the MEMORY is mostly coherent, it could better highlight the reasoning or emotions involved in changing the kitten's name to improve its helpfulness further."
