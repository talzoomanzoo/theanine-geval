Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it! Speaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to? Speaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has seen the Disney movie 'Luca' recently.\n2. Speaker B's kids enjoyed watching 'Luca' and said it was good.\n3. Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good.\n4. Speaker B's husband enjoys Disney sports movies, such as 'Miracle'.\n5. Speaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids.\n6. Speaker B recommends Speaker A to watch 'Miracle'.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a fun trip to Hawaii! I'm sure you'll have an amazing time. As for me, we've been watching a lot of Disney movies lately. Maybe we should plan a movie night together soon!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information for Speaker B to generate a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes useful details, such as Speaker A's recent watch of 'Luca', and Speaker B's family's enjoyment of Disney movies, which ties into the conversation about movie recommendations. However, some sentences in MEMORY do not contribute significantly or aren't particularly connected to the current context (e.g., Speaker B enjoying watching movies with her kids without further context or causality to Speaker A's recent activities). Some connections, such as Speaker B recommending 'Miracle', seem slightly redundant as this information was confirmed to have already happened in the dialogue. Overall, while it offers helpful insights, the connections and causality among the details can be improved for a higher score."
