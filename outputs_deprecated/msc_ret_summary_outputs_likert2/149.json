Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food? Speaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too? Speaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also? Speaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways? Speaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy? Speaker A: I think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals. Speaker B: Yea, that totally makes sense! I just wanted time off to spend with the dogs and look for a better job elsewhere, I'm hoping that I'll be able to get a job outside of a warehouse! Speaker A: That is understandable. I didn't always think I would end up a zookeeper. Do you have anything in mind?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has penguins at the zoo and enjoys working with animals, offering Speaker B a chance to help out.\n2. Speaker A works at a zoo and is willing to help Speaker B get an entry-level position there.\n3. Speaker B is looking for a new job and is excited about the opportunity at the zoo.\n4. Speaker A mentions that entry-level positions at the zoo involve cleaning enclosures and feeding less dangerous animals but offer decent pay, training, benefits, and assistance with schooling.\n5. Speaker B has elderly terriers and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one.\n6. Speaker A works at a zoo and has tried playing music for the white tigers and home concerts for their pets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm thinking about applying for an entry-level position at the zoo you mentioned. It sounds like a great opportunity!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that is connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. In the context, Speaker B is seen discussing job prospects and career changes, and Speaker A is offering suggestions and sharing experience related to working at a zoo. The MEMORY captures elements such as Speaker B's interest in finding a new job (point 3), which aligns with the context where Speaker B is expressing a desire to leave their current job. It also touches on Speaker A's zoo-related work and willingness to assist Speaker B in finding an entry-level position (points 1, 2, 4), providing a natural progression from the context's discussion. However, the memory about playing music for animals (point 6) isn't directly relevant to the context, and some details about Speaker B's current situation (point 5) could be better integrated. Overall, the MEMORY is quite helpful in facilitating an understanding of the dynamic and potential next steps in the conversation."
