Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you. Speaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them Speaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued.  Speaker B: Well if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get  Speaker A: Wow! Ok! This is sounding like a bigger undertaking! Should I embrace bugs in the home if they help the plants or am I getting wild? Speaker B: Well from my experince bugs do the complete opposite and don't help at all, so avoid that at all costs! Fertilizers are the way to go to help with growth. Speaker A: Oh man. I have lots to learn. What is the lifespan of a plum tree?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n4. Speaker B is also interested in space exploration and plant science, expressing concerns about the fuels used for space travel.\n5. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n6. Speaker A's parents are teachers.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Plum trees can live for about 15-20 years if well cared for. It's a long-term commitment, but the rewards of having fresh fruit in your own garden are worth it! Just make sure to provide the proper care and maintenance to ensure longevity.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information, notably that Speaker A struggles with gardening and is intrigued by certain concepts (space plants), which could relate to the discussion about making a garden at home. Speaker B's knowledge about plants and gardening is also relevant, as it aligns with the ongoing conversation where they give gardening advice. However, some parts of the MEMORY, such as Speaker B's interest in space exploration and plant science, do not directly relate to the current dialogue context. Similarly, the mention of Speaker A's parents being teachers is not connected to the current conversation. While the MEMORY includes useful information, it lacks a strong causal or relevant connection to all aspects of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which reduces its overall helpfulness."
