Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!

    "raw_prediction": "I have been to Italy, Spain, and Germany as well. Each country has its own unique charm and beauty. It sounds like you have had some amazing experiences too. How did you like France and Ireland?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that reflects earlier parts of the conversation, particularly Speaker B's search for internships and Speaker A's retirement. However, there are also inconsistencies and additions that weren't in the dialogue context: \n- Sentence 1 is partially relevant, though it combines hobbies (collecting shells) in a way that wasn't directly stated in the dialogue context.\n- Sentence 2 correctly captures Speaker A's encouragement to Speaker B about internships.\n- Sentence 3 about surfing as a way to make connections in the medical field is unrelated based on the dialogue provided.\n- Sentence 4 adds interest in sports medicine, which isn't addressed in the given dialogue.\n- Sentence 5 discusses learning to surf, which wasn't mentioned, though going to the beach aligns with Speaker B's interests.\n- Sentence 6 accurately captures Speaker B's focus on internships, though the mention of professors and recommendation letters is new information.\n\nOverall, some sentences are helpful but there are inaccuracies and new information not directly supported by the context provided."
