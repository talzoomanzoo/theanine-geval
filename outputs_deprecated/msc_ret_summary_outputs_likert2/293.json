Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week? Speaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you? Speaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n2. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n3. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n4. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n5. Speaker B plays Resident Evil VIII alone in the dark to make it scarier.\n6. Speaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "How about trying out something like Jurassic Park: World? It's a fun game with a different vibe compared to Resident Evil. Plus, it's always nice to mix things up and try something new!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information for Speaker B to generate a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights Speaker B's enthusiasm for playing video games and their recent purchase of Resident Evil VIII, which aligns with the context of having played Resident Evil during a storm. Additionally, it notes Speaker A's hesitance towards scary games but openness to trying them, as well as their preference for tamer games like Jurassic Park: World. This information is relevant and can help Speaker B suggest non-scary games or discuss their experience with Resident Evil. However, the MEMORY could be even more helpful by including more directly relevant past interactions or preferences that tie into current suggestions for non-scary games. Overall, the MEMORY captures relevant past interactions and preferences but leaves room to improve the direct connection to the current context."
