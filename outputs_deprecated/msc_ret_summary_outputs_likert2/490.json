    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. Speaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk? Speaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous. Speaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything. Speaker A: No, I don't have any pets; my apartment seems too small for a dog and I would worry about them being lonely all day when I'm at work. I was thinking about getting a pair of cats, but I haven't committed yet. How nice fo ryou to have company when you're walking though! What kind of dog do you have?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n2. Speaker B is an artist who walks through nature for work.\n3. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n4. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks.\n5. Speaker A asks about Speaker B's new artwork and acknowledges their need for inspiration.\n6. Speaker A enjoys reading sci-fi and mysteries, while Speaker B prefers fantasy books.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I have a border collie mix named Luna. She's full of energy and loves exploring the trails with me. Having a pet definitely adds to the experience. Cats can be great company too, they have their own kind of charm. If you do decide to get them, I'm sure they'll bring a lot of joy to your life.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context that can aid in generating the next response. It indicates that Speaker B enjoys nature walks and works with animals, which aligns with the conversation about nature walks and pets. Additionally, it mentions that Speaker B is an artist who draws inspiration from these walks, which can be relevant to the conversation as it links nature walks to their personal and professional life. However, some information, such as Speaker B's reading preferences and Speaker A's commuting habits, does not directly connect to the current conversation about walking and pets. Moreover, the MEMORY includes details about a conversation unrelated to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A asking about Speaker B's artwork, which does not provide direct relevance or causality to the existing dialogue. Thus, while there is some beneficial information, MEMORY as a whole is not seamlessly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
