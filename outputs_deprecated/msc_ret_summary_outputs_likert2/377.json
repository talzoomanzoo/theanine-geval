    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it. Speaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\n2. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n3. Speaker B is a member of the boy scouts and works at a fast food place\n4. Speaker B plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge for college applications.\n5. Speaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat.\n6. Speaker B is not yet in college but hopes to become an Eagle Scout.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like such a valuable experience for kids. I'll definitely look into getting my kids involved in Boy Scouts. And I'm glad you mentioned social skills too - that's just as important as the survival skills they'll learn. It's great to see the positive impact it's had on you as well.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that can be beneficial for generating a proper response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives context to Speaker B's experience with the Boy Scouts, such as their 7-8 years of involvement, their current position as a Life Scout, and their aspiration to become an Eagle Scout. This information demonstrates a deep commitment to scouting, which can be helpful for Speaker A to understand and continue the conversation about involving their kids in Boy Scouts. Additionally, the MEMORY highlights Speaker B's busy schedule, showing their dedication and potential willingness to make time for related events, which could be useful if the conversation turns to planning joint activities or events. However, a higher score could be achieved if the sentences were more interconnected to show clear causality or direct relevance to the current dialogue moment."
