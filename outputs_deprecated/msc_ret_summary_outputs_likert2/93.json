Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know.  Speaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like. Speaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too. Speaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you? Speaker A: Just my doggy Drunky.  You never know,  I might meet a nice lady out there.  Speaker B: Totally.  There will be a bunch of women there and it'll be easy to strike up conversations.  Just be confident and I'm sure you could walk away with a bunch of numbers.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n3. Speaker A enjoys going to bars and loves the ladies.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n5. Speaker A mentions Drunky, who is likely a pet.\n6. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful context and background information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Key details such as Speaker B's wife being pregnant (allowing for the context of her comfort in staying at the cabin), Speaker A's enjoyment of bluegrass music and social activities, and the mention of \"Drunky\" as a pet (specifically aligning with Speaker A's mention of camping with Drunky), are all directly relevant to the current conversation. The MEMORY provides a logical background that connects with the dialogue, showcasing the motivations and considerations of Speaker A and Speaker B. The only minor point is that some specific causality and development connections could be more explicitly drawn, such as how Speaker B's feelings of jealousy influence the conversation. However, overall, the MEMORY is well structured and informative."
