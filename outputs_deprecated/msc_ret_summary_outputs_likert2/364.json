Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha! Speaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes? Speaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe.  Speaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm?  Speaker B: I'll be living off campus, so absolutely. How about you? Are you staying in the dorms? Speaker A: I'm glad your taking them with you. My mum wants me to stay in dorms. But I think I just want my own place, less drama and more freedom that way. Speaker B: Yup. My parents wanted me to do the same thing...for \"that experience\". To be honest, I don't want it. It'd just be a distraction! \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n3. Speaker B is excited about taking neuroscience classes next year.\n4. Speaker A does not have any pets and expresses an interest in scuba diving.\n5. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n6. Speaker B is a veteran who went to the army after high school, interested in neuroscience and seeking advice on studying it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information but lacks strong connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT provided. The first point about Speaker B having two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel is directly relevant to the conversation, as they are discussing these snakes. However, the rest of the memory points do not directly support the continuation of the ongoing conversation about living arrangements, college, or dorm-related experiences. While it includes some potentially interesting aspects about Speaker A and Speaker B's backgrounds, such as volunteering, interests, and future academic plans, these do not provide immediate helpfulness in generating the very next response within the current dialogue's context. The lack of natural sequential or causal linkage between the MEMORIES and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT limits their utility in generating a coherent following response."
