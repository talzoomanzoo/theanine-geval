Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n2. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n3. Speaker B is looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing.\n4. Speaker A finds swimming relaxing and uses it to destress from their job.\n5. Speaker B does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies.\n6. Speaker A recommends hiking and exploring the local area for those who can't swim.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a response in the dialogue context but lacks coherence and clear causal connections among the points. \n\n- Point 1 is directly relevant because it mentions Speaker B's interest in punk music, which fits with the playlist discussion in the context.\n- Point 2 is loosely connected as it aligns with potential activities during the meetup, although there's nothing in the context suggesting programming lessons or swimming lessons were planned.\n- Point 3 doesn't have a direct link to a planned activity in the context but does mention activities that could happen at the meetup, so it offers some background but isn't essential.\n- Point 4 provides Speaker A's personal view about swimming, which might be helpful, but it's not directly linked to the context's topic.\n- Point 5 directly relates to Speaker B's unfamiliarity with swimming, mentioned in the context, making it somewhat relevant.\n- Point 6 introduces a new topic (hiking recommendations), which isn't directly related to what was discussed in the dialogue context.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY contains some points that are relevant and potentially useful for continuing the conversation, the connections between them are not strongly linked, and several points divert away from the immediate context."
