Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think? Speaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons Speaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use. Speaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful? Speaker A: Most of them were not.  It really depends on where on your body you get them.  Most of mine are on areas that didn't hurt.  The one on my foot and the one behind my ear did hurt a good bit.  Where were you thinking about getting it? Speaker B: I hadn't really thought about it! Maybe upper arm or upper back? But I'm no tattoo expert. And I'd have to get permission from my wife first, LOL Speaker A: Definitely talk to her first.  I had a friend that didn't talk to his wife and just came home with a tattoo one day.  It led to a huge fight - both about the money he spent and not discussing it with her.  He slept on my couch for over a week! Speaker B: Oh no! Yeah, you don't want to spring something like that on your spouse. I don't think you mentioned before, are you married?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n2. Speaker A's favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, saying \"for you I shall live\".\n3. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n4. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B have a conversation about their personal interests and trips they have taken for work.\n6. Speaker B enjoys fishing and wishes their wife and sons could have joined them on the trip.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "No, I'm not married. I've been focusing on my career and my tattoos, haha.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that helps to understand Speaker A's background and motivation for getting tattoos, such as the fact that they have several tattoos and that one is dedicated to their late father. This contextualizes Speaker A's interest in getting a tattoo for their mom, in line with what they have done for their dad. It also gives some insight into Speaker B's family life, though less directly connected to the tattoo discussion. \n\nHowever, the MEMORY lacks direct details that specifically relate to the Dialogue Context discussion, such as Speaker A's suggestions about tattoo placements or Speaker B's concern about needles. There is also no mention about the nature of Speaker B's relationship with their wife, which would have been useful given Speaker B's humorous comment about needing permission. Thus, while some parts of the MEMORY do provide relevant background information, they donâ€™t directly influence or support the current discussion contextually in the Dialogue. Additionally, the MEMORY's content is somewhat fragmented as it doesn't link the sentences in a naturally flowing manner, reducing its overall helpfulness as a seamless reference for generating responses."
