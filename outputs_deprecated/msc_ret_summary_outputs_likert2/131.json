Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting! Speaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n2. Speaker B is considering giving up their night job to focus on lab work and school.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n4. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n5. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n6. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that could assist in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it highlights Speaker B's interest and involvement in lab work (points 2 and 6) and their consideration of focusing more on it, which ties directly to the conversation about cloning a cow. This connection offers insight into Speaker B's commitment and the potential decision they face, which may influence the dialogue's progression. Additionally, MEMORY shows a blend of Speaker B's interests: molecular biology (point 4) and culinary endeavors (points 1 and 5), adding depth to their character and the context of their interactions. The MEMORY remains mostly coherent and relevant, although some details about cooking (points 1 and 5) are less connected to the immediate conversation about lab work and cloning but still provide useful context for the broader interaction between the speakers."
