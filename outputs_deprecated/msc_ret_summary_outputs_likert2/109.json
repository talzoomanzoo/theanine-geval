Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys playing soccer but is not into music.\n2. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n3. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n4. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n5. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n6. Speaker A is a college student majoring in Humanities, not currently employed but used to work part-time at a supermarket.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "I play as a striker for my team. It's definitely more exciting being up front and scoring goals. Speaking of which, I've been scoring pretty well lately, looking forward to our match next week.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains both relevant and irrelevant information with respect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Relevant elements include the fact that Speaker B played intramural soccer in college, which directly relates to the conversation about soccer positions. Further, Speaker B's support for Manchester United might help in building rapport around soccer discussions. Less relevant information includes Speaker A's employment history, academic studies, and particular enjoyment of soccer beyond just playing, which doesn't clearly relate to the current dialogue about playing positions. Overall, the MEMORY is moderately helpful, connecting to the context but not strongly tied to the specific conversation of soccer positions and experiences."
