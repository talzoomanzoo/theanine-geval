Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone?  Speaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!). Speaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol Speaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n2. Speaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\n3. Speaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding.\n4. Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\n5. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety.\n6. Speaker A is a runner who is working on improving their mile time and training for a marathon.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers useful information that can aid Speaker A, the language model, in generating a relevant response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY highlights past interactions and relevant details about both speakers. \n\n1. The information that Speaker B is a motivational speaker with experience in motivating people (points 2 and 4) is directly relevant to Speaker A's request for motivation.\n2. The detail that Speaker B has run a marathon before (point 3) and found it rewarding correlates with Speaker Aâ€™s current training for a marathon (point 6), possibly providing a shared experience they could discuss.\n3. Speaker B's personal backstory of using motivational speaking to overcome personal challenges (point 5) adds depth to the conversation and can be relevant if Speaker A is experiencing similar challenges due to the weather.\n4. However, some sentences like point 1 about training for the Alps marathon (mentioned in MEMORY but not directly discussed in the CONTEXT) might not immediately aid in the response generation for the current context.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is mostly helpful due to the connection it draws between Speaker A's and Speaker B's roles and past experiences, potentially enriching the conversation with relevant details."
