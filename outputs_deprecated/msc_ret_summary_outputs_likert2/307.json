Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? Speaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month Speaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation? Speaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there! Speaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo? Speaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n2. Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they go to the zoo every few weeks.\n3. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds.\n4. Speaker A enjoys seeing pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo.\n6. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a fun trip! I hope you have a great time in San Diego. Make sure to take lots of pictures at the zoo!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that connects naturally to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. In the dialogue, Speaker B mentions visiting the zoo and enjoying pandas, and the MEMORY effectively expands on this by providing details about Speaker B's frequent zoo visits, girlfriend's interest in pandas, and his consideration of adopting a kitten. Additionally, there's a mention of hobbies which lines up with the overall tone of the conversation focusing on personal interests. However, while some elements such as Speaker A's interests and experience at the zoo are mentioned, they do not directly influence the immediate continuation of this particular conversation. Hence, while the MEMORY is quite relevant and naturally structured, not every detail is essential in this context, leading to a score of 4 rather than a perfect 5."
