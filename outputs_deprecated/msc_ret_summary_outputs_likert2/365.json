Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession.\n2. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n3. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n4. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n5. Speaker B is a professional in a practice, where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients.\n6. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could help Speaker B generate a proper response to the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, points 1 and 3 provide insights into Speaker B's career as a therapist, which could be used to reply to Speaker A's question. However, some details, such as being a football fan (point 2) or horse ownership (point 4), have less direct relevance to the current conversation about becoming a therapist. Additionally, the MEMORY could better connect different pieces of information to create an overarching narrative or causality, such as how Speaker B's experiences influenced their decision to become a therapist. Overall, the MEMORY offers some useful details but lacks a cohesive connection to the context."
