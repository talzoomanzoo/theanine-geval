Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing?

I'll be staying with some of them while I'm over there. I have never been to Greece....I'd like to go though. Maybe I'll add it to my itinerary! Maybe we could plan to be in Greece at the same time?!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology.\n2.

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! It would be wonderful to explore Greece together and dive deeper into the history and mythology. Let's definitely plan to be there at the same time and make some unforgettable memories.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information but lacks a comprehensive connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 1 is partially relevant as it mentions Speaker B's interest in Greece, which is somewhat connected to the dialogue. Sentence 2 is somewhat related as it touches upon Speaker A's planned trip to Italy, which was mentioned in the context, but it inaccurately mentions travel alone. Sentence 3 is not directly related to the current conversation but provides some background on Speaker B's past experiences in Italy. Sentence 4 is not directly relevant to the dialogue, and neither is sentence 6. Sentence 5 is relevant because it aligns with Speaker B's passion for Greek mythology discussed in the context. Overall, the sentences are not well-connected or oriented towards direct development or causality within the provided dialogue, which limits their helpfulness."
