Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n2. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n3. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n4. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n5. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n6. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant context regarding Speaker B's academic background and career aspirations, which are directly related to the discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about career options and teaching. The information that Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and considering a master's degree or becoming a college professor (sentences 1 and 2) is particularly useful for generating a response about career options in academia. Additionally, the mention of volunteering at a university (sentence 6) supports Speaker B's interest in academia, aligning well with the idea of pursuing a career in teaching. However, the details about Speaker A's career interests and current job (sentences 4 and 5) are less directly relevant to Speaker B's career discussion, which slightly limits the MEMORY's helpfulness in generating a response specific to Speaker B. Nonetheless, the MEMORY contains useful and coherent information for the current dialogue context."
