Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing? Speaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from? Speaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is working on other portraits and taking care of a sick dog.\n2. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets.\n3. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n4. Speaker B is in college, paints on the side, and has five dogs and three rats.\n5. Speaker A prefers adopting pets from shelters rather than from breeders.\n6. Speaker A is getting their portrait painted by Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great! Adopting from shelters is always a wonderful choice. Your new cat will surely appreciate being given a loving home.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful information that may assist Speaker B in generating an appropriate response in the dialogue context. For example, MEMORIES about Speaker B's painting activities, particularly portraits and pets, align with the ongoing conversation about portrait painting. The mention of different types of pets and the connection between painting and pets (e.g., \"Speaker B discovered a love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets\") is relevant and could steer the conversation naturally. Additionally, Speaker A's preference for adopting pets from shelters is already acknowledged in the context and aligns with their current plans to visit a shelter for a new cat. However, the MEMORY could benefit from more explicit connections between specific points, such as how Speaker B juggles college, painting, and caring for multiple pets, to create a richer narrative thread."
