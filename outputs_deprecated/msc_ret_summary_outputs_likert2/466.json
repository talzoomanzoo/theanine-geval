Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer? Speaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to? Speaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods.\n2. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo.\n3. Speaker A is planning to visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend.\n4. Speaker B is waiting for bands to announce their summer tour schedule to plan which shows to attend.\n5. Speaker B recommends visiting the Museum of Art of São Paulo in the city.\n6. Speaker B enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food and live music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for Speaker B to generate a proper next response, but it is not highly relevant or directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Here's why:\n\n1. Sentence 1 and Sentence 3 offer information related to Speaker A's interest in museums, aligning somewhat with Speaker A's mention of a museum and impressionist paintings in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n2. Sentences 2 and 4 provide context about Speaker A's interest in music concerts and Speaker B's plans for concerts, adding slight background relevance to the conversation about concerts.\n3. Sentence 5 mentions the Museum of Art of São Paulo, which is relevant if connected to the museum theme, but this is not the case in the context given.\n4. Sentence 6 about Speaker B's enjoyment of city life provides context but does not closely link to the immediate conversation topic.\n\nOverall, MEMORY provides some background and related interests but lacks strong, direct connections or causality to maximize its helpfulness for generating the next response in the current dialogue."
