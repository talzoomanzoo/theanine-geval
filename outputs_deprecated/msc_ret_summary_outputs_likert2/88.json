Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n4. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.\n5. Speaker B is not going out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy.\n6. Speaker B's wife is pregnant and has three more months to go until the due date.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! I'll talk to my wife and see if she's up for it. Thanks for offering the cabin, it would definitely make things easier for her.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides a comprehensive context that is very relevant and helpful for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes multiple aspects of Speaker B's situation, such as the pregnancy, the logistics of attending a festival with a baby, and Speaker B's feelings about the situation. This background information helps a language model understand why the offer of a cabin might be particularly appealing to Speaker B and their wife. The MEMORY is well-structured and naturally connected, clearly demonstrating causality and relevancy. This makes it easy for a language model to draw connections and generate an appropriate response."
