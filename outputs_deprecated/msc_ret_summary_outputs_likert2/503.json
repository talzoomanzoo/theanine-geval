Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music. Speaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band? Speaker B: I'm big fan of aerosmith. When do you learn music. Whom teach you?

Still I didn't get right teacher. I'm jealous on you. I don't have like your dad. Speaker A: what instrument have you been trying to learn?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician.\n2. Speaker B is willing to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook.\n3.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that could help in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\nPoints of relevance include:\n- Speaker A is a musician and plays in a band, which ties into the context of discussing musical interests and experiences.\n- Speaker A is specifically a drummer, which connects with their history of being taught drums by their father as mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n- Speaker A plays concerts with the band, which is in line with the conversation about live music experiences.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY also contains information that is less directly related, such as Speaker B's interest in fishing and math skills, and Speaker A's limited concert attendance, which don't contribute much to the progression of the current dialogue. Additionally, the connection between the MEMORY entries and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT could be more clearly established to boost its helpfulness."
