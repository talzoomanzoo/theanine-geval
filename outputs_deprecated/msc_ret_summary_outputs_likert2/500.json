Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music. Speaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band? Speaker B: I'm big fan of aerosmith. When do you learn music. Whom teach you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician.\n2. Speaker B is willing to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook.\n3. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend.\n4. Speaker A is part of a band that tours different countries for their music.\n5. Speaker A was good at writing in school, while Speaker B was bad at math and preferred fishing.\n6. Speaker A enjoys surfing and music as a way to escape from daily life.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that can help generate a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, sentences 1, 3, and 4 contain useful details about Speaker A being a musician who plays in a band and tours internationally. This information is connected to the current dialogue, where Speaker B is inquiring about Speaker A's musical background. The connection between Speaker A's musical interests and background is clear, making these elements of the MEMORY helpful for crafting a response related to music.\n\nHowever, other parts of the MEMORY, such as Speaker B's willingness to teach Speaker A fishing and cooking (sentence 2) and details about school preferences and skills (sentence 5), don't provide relevant or necessary context for this particular conversation about music and bands. These reduce the overall connectedness and development of the MEMORY as it relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Hence, a score of 3 reflects the presence of some helpful, but not entirely cohesive or relevant, memory components."
