Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. Speaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?   Speaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone. Speaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you? Speaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know. Speaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient!  Speaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends? Speaker B: No not at all but if you didn't feel comfortable talking to me I can recommend a couple of my colleagues who are just as brilliant Speaker A: I'd prefer to see you since I'm already comfortable talking to you! It will get the awkward part out of the way for me!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession.\n2. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n3. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n4. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n5. Speaker A works at a stable and enjoys being around horses.\n6. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful for Speaker B to generate a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The information that Speaker B is a therapist and has been working in their own practice for about six years (point 6) is directly related to the dialogue context where Speaker B is offering therapy services to Speaker A. This establishes Speaker B's credibility and experience, which are relevant to the conversation.\n\nHowever, the rest of the MEMORY points are not directly relevant to the immediate conversation. For instance, Speaker B being a football fan or considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse (points 2 and 3) do not contribute to the current dialogue context regarding therapy. Points about horses (3, 4, 5) could potentially be relevant if the dialogue continued to explore Speaker A's relationship with horses further, but they aren't explicitly relevant to the immediate context of deciding on therapy. \n\nThe MEMORY points are not connected clearly in a way that shows causality or development, as required for higher scores. They are more like standalone facts about the speakers, rather than a cohesive background leading to the current context. Therefore, while the MEMORY contains some helpful and relevant information, it lacks the strong interconnectedness that would push the score higher."
