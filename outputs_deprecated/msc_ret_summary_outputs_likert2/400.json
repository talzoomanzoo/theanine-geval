Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad. Speaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has devices to keep bugs away and offers to share the product names with Speaker B.\n2. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n3. Speaker B regrets their green and purple color scheme and is willing to give away their purple furniture.\n4. Speaker A is looking to redecorate their house and likes purple furniture.\n5. Speaker B is considering adding more colorful elements to the room to make the purple sofas work.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY includes details about Speaker A and Speaker B's preferences and discussions about home decor and furniture, which are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These memories provide helpful information about the ongoing conversation regarding color schemes and decorating. There is also information about Speaker A's interest in music, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about playing guitar. This connection and previous discussions about home decor can aid in generating a natural continuation of the conversation. However, the MEMORY could be improved by including more about the use of bug spray, which is a topic mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, though, the MEMORY is mostly relevant and connected."
