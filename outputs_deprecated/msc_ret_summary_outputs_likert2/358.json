Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n3. Speaker A does not have any pets and expresses an interest in scuba diving.\n4. Speaker B prefers animals to humans but acknowledges the importance of curing diseases.\n5. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n6. Speaker A is scared of sharks but finds the idea of going into a steel cage with them interesting.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! I can imagine how convenient it must be to have low-maintenance pets like snakes. I'm more of a scuba diving person myself, but I can see the appeal of having animals as companions.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides a mix of helpful and less helpful information. Memory sentence 1 directly relates to the context since the dialogue is about Speaker B’s pet snakes, Hansel and Gretel. Sentence 4 does not directly relate to the dialogue, but it does provide some depth on Speaker B’s character. Sentence 3 introduces an unrelated topic about Speaker A’s interest in scuba diving, which has no clear connection to the current dialogue context. Sentence 6, although interesting, also does not directly contribute to the generation of a relevant response in the current dialogue context. Sentence 5 adds further information about Speaker A's activities, but it's difficult to seamlessly connect it with the ongoing conversation about snakes. Overall, while there is some useful information, the memory contains several points that lack direct relevance and connectivity to the current context."
