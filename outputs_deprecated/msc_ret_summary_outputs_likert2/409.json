Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece.\n2. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian.\n3. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\n4. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five.\n5. Speaker B asks Speaker A if their trip is more for relaxation or sightseeing.\n6. Speaker A hasn't planned their trip out yet but is open to suggestions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm so glad you booked the excursion to the Acropolis! It's truly a breathtaking experience. The history and architecture there are just amazing. You'll love it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that can be helpful for Speaker B to generate a meaningful response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 5 are directly relevant, as they relate to visiting the Acropolis and potential interests of Speaker A—between relaxation or sightseeing—which can guide Speaker B in formulating an engaging and pertinent response. \n\nThe MEMORY naturally connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT since the context mentions an excursion to the Acropolis and requests more information. While the MEMORY does not contain specific details about the Acropolis, it establishes that Speaker B is knowledgeable and excited about places in Greece, which lends a natural basis for Speaker B to share insights or additional suggestions. Additionally, memories related to Speaker B's excitement about the trip and personal interest in Athena provide a personal touch which can foster a more engaging dialogue.\n\nOverall, while MEMORY could be strengthened by more detailed past interactions specifically about the Acropolis or the Parthenon, it still offers helpful context for Speaker B to continue the conversation effectively."
