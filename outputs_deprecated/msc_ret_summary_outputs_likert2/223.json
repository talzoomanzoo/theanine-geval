Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods. Speaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about? Speaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America. Have you seen any of those movies?

Don't go see Black Widow without watching Avengers first. I had an amazing steak and vegetables on the side that were delicious. What is you favorite food?  Speaker B: Oh ok I definitely will watch those first! I love both steak and vegetables! I am a real foodie and love just about everything that isn't too strange to try lol.\n\nMEMORY:\n1.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some potentially useful information, such as Speaker A's preference for Brazilian food, which aligns with their mention of enjoying Brazilian foods during the movie. However, most of the memory points are not directly related to the dialogue context, such as the mentions of salsa dancing, Speaker B's interest in healing methods, and Speaker B's job as a bartender. These do not seem directly relevant to aide in generating Speaker A's next response based on the current dialogue context about movies and food preferences. Additionally, there isn't a clear and natural connection or development among the memory points themselves, which reduces the overall helpfulness for generating a context-relevant continuation."
