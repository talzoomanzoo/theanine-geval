Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and their brother enjoy going to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner.\n2.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could help Speaker B generate a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it mentions Speaker A's and their brother's enjoyment of Brazilian food, which ties into the context where Speaker A enjoyed Brazilian foods. Additionally, MEMORY includes the details that Speaker A plans to have dinner with their brother and likes salsa dancing, which could be relevant if Speaker B is to continue the conversation about their plans or interests. However, the MEMORY contains information about salsa dancing and healing work that doesn't clearly connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, reducing its overall helpfulness."
