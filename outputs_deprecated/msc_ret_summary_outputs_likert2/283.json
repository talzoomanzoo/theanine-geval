Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar. Speaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general? Speaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition.\n2. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n3. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n4. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n5. Speaker A is eating their favorite jello.\n6. Speaker B does not do a lot of cooking or baking but is interested in learning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It's true, baking can be quite the sugar fest. Maybe you can try out some healthier dessert options, like fruit-based ones or jello with less sugar.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information that could be somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it establishes that Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, which aligns with the current conversation topic about jello and family traditions. However, the sentences in MEMORY are not particularly well connected to provide a strong sense of causality or relevance to the ongoing discussion about reducing sugar in desserts or learning recipes. While some sentences address Speaker A's connection to jello, they don't add significant new insights or advancement of past interactions that would greatly aid in generating a conversational response in this context. Additionally, the connection between the memory points and the context isn't as robust or explicit as it could be, limiting its helpfulness."
