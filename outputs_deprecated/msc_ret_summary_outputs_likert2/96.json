Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know.  Speaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like. Speaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too. Speaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you? Speaker A: Just my doggy Drunky.  You never know,  I might meet a nice lady out there.  Speaker B: Totally.  There will be a bunch of women there and it'll be easy to strike up conversations.  Just be confident and I'm sure you could walk away with a bunch of numbers. Speaker A: Oh, I definitely will. Thanks for the motivation. Is this going to me your first festival? Speaker B: No, I used to go to them all the time.  This will be my first one in a while and probably my last since my wife and I are about to have our baby. Speaker A: You could make this one festival your \"escape\" every year. Don't give up the festivals, you need to have something to keep you happy.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n3. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.\n4. Speaker B dislikes public transportation and enjoys going to festivals, but misses doing so.\n5. Speaker A enjoys going to bars and loves the ladies.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it's not perfectly aligned or fully connected in a natural way that shows clear causality or relevancy. There are a few pertinent points, such as Speaker B's wife's pregnancy and their past festival experiences, which are directly relevant to the current topic of attending the bluegrass festival. Details about Speaker A enjoying the company of women are also contextually relevant given his previous comment about meeting someone at the festival.\n\nHowever, not all points are particularly helpful or naturally connected to the ongoing conversation in the context. For instance, the mention of handling festival logistics with a small baby feels less relevant to the immediate discussion and doesnâ€™t add much to potential responses. Some points, like Speaker B's dislike for public transportation, are not connected to the current dialogue context about the festival plans. Furthermore, there's little evidence in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT of Speaker B feeling jealous, which suggests a mismatch.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides some useful context about past discussions, but could be more focused and cohesive in demonstrating connections and causality for future dialogue generation."
