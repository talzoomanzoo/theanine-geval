Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there? Speaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay? Speaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately? Speaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"' Speaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history. Speaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n2. Speaker B has an oldest nephew who is about to turn 14.\n3. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\n5. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n6. Both Speaker A's mother and Speaker A were librarians, but Speaker A is retired.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "He's doing great, thanks for asking! He's about to turn 14, can you believe it? Time really does fly. I need to start planning his birthday party soon. By the way, I haven't started packing yet for my trip. I should probably get on that soon, lol.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information, such as Speaker B planning an adventurous trip and having an oldest nephew who is about to turn 14. However, it lacks clear connections or causality between the listed points and the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Some details, like the humor in their conversation and Speaker A's background as a librarian, do not directly help generate a suitable next response. Additionally, there is no mention of the current discussion about books, the Gettysburg Campaign, or immediate travel plans, which could more directly inform Speaker B's response. Overall, the MEMORY provides a moderate level of helpfulness, and it could benefit from more focused and directly relevant connections to the current conversation."
