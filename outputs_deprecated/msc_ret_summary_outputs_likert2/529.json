Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing? Speaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from? Speaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there. Speaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat?  Speaker A: I've thought of a lot of  names, but in the end it will probably depend on the breed and the sex.   Speaker B: That's true. Is pilates hard? I've always wanted to try it but I don't know if it will be too difficult. Speaker A: No, I don't think it's hard.  I actually enjoy it.  It's more fun than work, at least to me. You should give it a try! Speaker B: Maybe I will. Do you think I can start at home by watching Youtube videos, or do I need to go to a Pilates class? Speaker A: You can probably start with Youtube just to see if you like it.  Much better to go to a class I think though.  Of course, I'm biased. I'm in love with my instructor! haha Speaker B: Lol, okay I will definitely try it at home first. If I can get the hang of it, I will sign up for a class. Hopefully I can get an instructor as good as yours lol!  Speaker A: Well, getting some individual responses to questions and individual attention at times, I think makes a difference. But there is nothing wrong with going to youtube first!  I did!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n2. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets.\n3. Speaker A reads a novel a week, lives in the city, and goes to pilates class.\n4. Speaker A is considering getting kittens and thinks rats can be smart.\n5. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy the company of their pets and think they are smart and playful.\n6. Speaker B is in college, paints on the side, and has five dogs and three rats.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks for the advice! I'll definitely give it a shot and see how it goes. Individual attention from an instructor does sound appealing though.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and useful information for generating a response in the context of the ongoing conversation between Speaker A and Speaker B. Here's why:\n\n- MEMORY 1 and 5 highlight Speaker B's interest in animals and their interactions, which directly ties into the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where pets are a topic of discussion. This reinforces Speaker B's affection and familiarity with pets.\n- MEMORY 2 emphasizes Speaker B's painting hobby, which is relevant as the conversation begins with a mention of portraits and Speaker B's intention to paint a portrait of their pets.\n- MEMORY 3 acknowledges Speaker A's interest in pilates, which is relevant to the conversation as it mentions pilates and Speaker A's positive experience with it.\n- MEMORY 4 and 5 provide insights into both speakers' affection for animals, supporting the conversational topic of their companions being smart and playful.\n- MEMORY 6 offers context about Speaker B's life and interests, which can guide responses relating to pets and activities.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is well-connected and offers helpful information that can enhance the generation of relevant and coherent responses in the conversation. However, the relevancy could be slightly improved by being more focused on the specific current topics (e.g., more details on pilates or other ongoing conversational threads)."
