Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her? Speaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon Speaker A: Yes I have been saving up for another trip to Italy! I can't wait. It's planned for next Spring. Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future? Speaker B: I would love to get back to Italy but need to save up and the hopeful priority is to Greece this year.  You have friends in Europe are you in contact to see what plans you can make? Speaker A: Yes I've been talking to them quite a bit so they know what's going on. I'll be staying with some of them while I'm over there. I have never been to Greece....I'd like to go though. Maybe I'll add it to my itinerary! Maybe we could plan to be in Greece at the same time?! Speaker B: That would be so good.  There is so much history and the roman statues i take my daughter to see in the museums and through our local resources is fab.  She is building up the passion which is lovely to see.  Have you still got your hair blue or has it grown out now? Speaker A: That's awesome! Maybe you can teach me a little about all the mythology. I think I've never liked it before only because I didn't understand it. My hair is back to being its natural brown - lol I'm being boring for the moment. Speaker B: Never boring you will keep styling it all sorts of interesting styles im sure.  Yes i would be lovely to be your guide for the day out in Greece.  Bring some decent walking boots and some sun cream, its a different heat out there but your tan is probably topped up with going to the beach each day.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology.\n2. Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries.\n3. Speaker A is planning to travel to Italy alone for Spring Break and has friends from Europe meeting up with them.\n4. Speaker B has been to Italy in the past and enjoyed the food there.\n5. Speaker B enjoys Greek mythology and did a case study on Poseidon, the God of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses.\n6. Speaker A is planning for a spring break trip and recently bought a dress for Easter.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information but lacks a coherent structure or direct connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT that would make it more helpful. The following observations are made about the MEMORY:\n\n1. The first and second sentences provide background on Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology and desire to visit Greece, which is relevant to the dialogue context. However, these sentences are not directly connected, and their relevance is somewhat broad. \n2. Sentence 3 provides relevant information about Speaker A's trip to Italy and European friends, which aligns with the conversation in the dialogue context. Still, the helpfulness is lessened by the lack of additional detail or explicit connection to the current dialogue content.\n3. Sentence 4 indicates Speaker B's past experience in Italy; however, this background information adds limited value to generating the next response.\n4. Sentence 5 gives specific details about Speaker B's passion for Greek mythology, particularly about Poseidon, which is somewhat useful but not directly relevant to the last parts of the dialogue.\n5. Sentence 6 slightly overlaps with Sentence 3 but adds insignificant value to the conversation as it introduces new, unrelated information.\n\nOverall, while some information in the MEMORY pertains to the topics discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it lacks a coherent focus and fails to connect ideas in a way that adds substantial value to continue the conversation effectively."
