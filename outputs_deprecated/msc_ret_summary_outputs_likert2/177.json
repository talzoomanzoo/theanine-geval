    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you? Speaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses. Speaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set? Speaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n2. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.\n3. Speaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies, which influenced Speaker B's favorite genre.\n4. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n5. Speaker A prefers classic horror movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th over modern ones.\n6. Speaker B has a government job that pays the bills but wishes they could work in interior design.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a crazy and intense moment on set! It's amazing how dedicated and focused everyone must be to create those realistic horror scenes. It must have been quite the sight to see!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a good amount of relevant information that can help generate an informed and engaging next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it mentions Speaker B's creation of horror movies with their dad, which aligns with their current involvement in producing horror movies as mentioned in the context. This connection can enhance the conversation about their experiences and influences in horror movie production. Additionally, the MEMORY provides background on Speaker A's preferences and interests, like their liking for classic horror movies and mid-century design, which could be useful for identifying mutual interests or steering the conversation towards those topics.\n\nHowever, some entries (such as Speaker A's preference for mid-century design and classic horror movies) are only marginally relevant to the ongoing topic in the dialogue, which is primarily focused on horror movie production. Moreover, there is some redundancy in the MEMORY, such as the similar information about Speaker B's father's influence being repeated in different entries (1 and 3). \n\nOverall, the MEMORY is quite helpful, but it could be slightly more concise and tailored more towards the current line of dialogue for the highest score."
