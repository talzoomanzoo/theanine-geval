Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n2. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n3. Speaker B is considering giving up their night job to focus on lab work and school.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the challenges and rewards of having a dog with hearing issues.\n6. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Definitely! I'm really looking forward to being part of those advancements in molecular biology. It's such a fascinating field.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: MEMORY contains several useful points related to Speaker B's involvement with lab work, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about lab work. For example, sentences 1, 2, and 3 provide background information on Speaker B's academic and professional interests in biology and lab research, which could guide the language model to craft a response focused on Speaker B's lab activities. However, sentences 4, 5, and 6 provide information on different topics not directly linked to the immediate contextâ€”different work fields, challenges with a dog, and a casserole recipe. While these details might be relevant in broader conversations about their interests or hobbies, they don't contribute to developing the next response in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT directly related to lab work and the cow cloning event. Therefore, MEMORY is partially helpful but not entirely optimized for generating the next response."
