Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it!

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds intriguing! Let me know how it is, I might add it to my list for next weekend.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides information that is relevant and helpful for Speaker A to generate the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains details about past interactions between the speakers, such as Speaker A's interest in movies and reliance on Speaker B's recommendations, along with Speaker B's taste in films. These details align well with the dialogue and help build a coherent narrative about their past conversations regarding movie recommendations. However, while the MEMORY provides useful context and causality, it could further benefit from more specific connections to the current dialogue, like why Speaker A chose \"Coming to America\" next or Speaker B's specific anticipated films in certain genres. Nevertheless, the existing MEMORY helps to frame the ongoing movie recommendation discussion."
