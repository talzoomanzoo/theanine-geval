Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A suggested the name Zhao for one of the kittens.\n2. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n3. Speaker B has an older mellow cat and is concerned about training the new energetic kittens.\n4. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n5. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n6. Speaker B has two sick kitties and recently received a rescue.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context and background regarding the discussion of naming kittens. It includes relevant information such as Speaker A suggesting the name \"Zhao\" for one of the kittens, and Speaker B considering Mandarin names due to their personalities. This is directly related to the topic of naming the kittens, which makes it partially helpful for generating a response.\n\nAdditionally, the memory mentions Speaker B's adoption paperwork and concerns about training the energetic kittens, providing more context about their situation with the kittens. However, some sentences, such as those related to Speaker A's parrot, are unrelated to the naming discussion and do not contribute to generating a suitable response in the given context. Also, the mention of Speaker B's sick kitties and recent rescue could be more relevant if connected to the dialogue context.\n\nOverall, while the memory contains some useful elements, it is somewhat fragmented and could be more coherently connected to the given dialogue context for maximum helpfulness."
