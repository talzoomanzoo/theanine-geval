Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food? Speaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too? Speaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid.\n2. Speaker A's pet raccoon enjoys eating pizza.\n3. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature.\n4. Speaker B has two terrier dogs as pets.\n5. Speaker B asks Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for music and plan to have a house concert with their pets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but also includes details that are either unnecessary or not clearly connected. The MEMORY does establish that Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey, which aligns with Journey eating the pizza in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It also mentions that Journey enjoys eating pizza, which ties directly into the dialogue about Journey eating a whole piece of pizza. However, MEMORY also includes information about Speaker A having a bearded dragon named Sid, which doesn't directly connect to the current dialogue involving the incident with Journey. Furthermore, there is a mention of Speaker A having dogs and an unrelated admiration by Speaker B, which adds confusion. The detail about Speaker B having two terrier dogs is slightly relevant since Speaker B discusses their dogs, but other elements like the house concert with pets and a previous question if Speaker A has had a pet raccoon are not directly useful for following the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, MEMORY does contain helpful elements, but it could be more streamlined and focused on the current topic of conversation."
