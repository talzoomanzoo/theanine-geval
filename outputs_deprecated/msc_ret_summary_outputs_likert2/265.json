Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment.  Speaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon? Speaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think? Speaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus! Speaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing? Speaker A: Yea, I think for the more complicated origami it's kind of a use it or lose it but for the simple stuff you can usually take a couple months of and still remember to do it! Did you see origami in Japan? Speaker B: Not up close, but I noticed a lot in shop windows in certain areas. I love Japan -- they're so welcoming. One of our acquaintances GAVE me a kimono. She said it's customary to try to share their culture. Kind of different from America in my opinion.  \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A wishes to visit the country where origami was originally created, possibly Japan.\n2. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n3. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n4. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n5. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n6. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a proper response in the context of the ongoing dialogue about origami. The following points contribute to the score:\n\n1. Point 2 in MEMORY mentions that Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks, which fits with the dialogue context where Speaker B expresses interest in learning origami from Speaker A. This information could be used to reinforce the context and help generate responses about setting up a time for teaching.\n\n2. The MEMORY mentions Speaker A's interest in origami (point 4), aligning with Speaker A's excitement over winning a prize in the origami contest. While this connection provides helpful background, MEMORY's point 4 about Speaker A trying to make a Lotus flower is somewhat redundant with the context but still relevant, supporting Speaker A's interest in origami.\n\n3. Point 6 indicates that Speaker B is interested in making origami animals, which ties to their general interest in origami, and can enrich the dialogue by acknowledging specific interests.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY also contains less relevant details, such as points 1, 3, and 5. These details are not directly connected to the conversation and thus do not add significant value in aiding response generation. Additionally, there seems to be a contradiction between points 4 and 5 regarding the lotus origami, which makes the MEMORY less coherent overall. As a result, the HELPFULNESS score is not higher."
