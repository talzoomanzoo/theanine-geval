Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. Speaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk? Speaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous. Speaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything. Speaker A: No, I don't have any pets; my apartment seems too small for a dog and I would worry about them being lonely all day when I'm at work. I was thinking about getting a pair of cats, but I haven't committed yet. How nice fo ryou to have company when you're walking though! What kind of dog do you have? Speaker B: Cats can be nice! I used to have cats, but am allergic to them and had to give them to my friend. I have an Australian Kelpie who is a rescue. She is very energetic and smart! Speaker A: I had cats as a child and I think that they're a bit easier to care for than dogs, especially in the city. I am a dog lover as well though; Australian Kelpies are gorgeous! What is her name? Does she walk well off-leash? Speaker B: Yes, cats are very smart and clean. Mine used to bring me a mouse to throw for her, just like a dog! And if you have 2 cats, they play with each other! Mine would run up and down the halls in the middle of the night, haha. Her name is Kyrie, and she walks off leash and is very obedient. Dogs might be hard to keep in your small apartment though, since Kyrie likes to play in the field, run with cars along the fence row, and herd goats.  Speaker A: Oh wow! So Kyrie is a working dog? She helps your dad out on the farm?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n2. Speaker B is an artist who walks through nature for work.\n3. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n4. Speaker B's family consists of a nurse mom, a farmer dad, and a sister.\n5. Speaker B gets along somewhat with their sister.\n6. Speaker A also enjoyed reading 'Redwall' growing up and keeps an eye out for similar books.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yep, Kyrie is definitely a working dog. She loves to help out on the farm, especially when it comes to herding the goats. It's in her blood, being an Australian Kelpie and all. She's a natural at it!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains scattered information about Speaker B's background and interests, but it does not provide specific or relevant details that directly aid in generating the next response in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around nature walks, pets, and a conversation about pets, specifically cats and dogs. While MEMORY provides some unrelated facts about Speaker B's family and Speaker A's reading habits when growing up, it misses crucial mentions of Speaker B's dog, Kyrie, or their shared interests in outdoor activities and pets, which would be more relevant to the ongoing dialogue. Additionally, there is a lack of connection and natural flow between the MEMORY's content and the dialogue context."
