Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n3. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n4. Speaker A is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock.\n5. Speaker A will use the money earned from the store to buy the hammock online.\n6. Speaker A plans to bring sandwiches and fruit for the hike, specifically asking about veggie sandwiches for Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several relevant and helpful pieces of information for Speaker B to generate a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n- Sentence 1 establishes the background that Speaker A applied to the grocery store recently mentioned.\n- Sentence 2 could potentially help Speaker B relate the new job to Speaker B's friend who works there, providing an opportunity for shared understanding or advice.\n- Sentences 3, 4, and 5 provide context about Speaker A's current life situation, objectives, and how they intend to use their earnings, which could guide Speaker B in providing meaningful support or advice.\n- Sentence 6, although not directly relevant to the job offer, adds context to Speaker A's future activities and plans which might link to future interactions between the speakers.\n\nOverall, MEMORY provides contextually relevant background information that assists in creating a coherent and supportive response to the dialogue prompt. However, the connection between a few sentences and the current dialogue could be stronger, hence a score of 4."
