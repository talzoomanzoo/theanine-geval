Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information for generating a next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures that Speaker A is interested in movies and relies on Speaker B for recommendations, which aligns with their conversation about movie preferences and recommendations. Memory point 2 highlights Speaker B's role in recommending movies, and point 4 mentions Speaker A's preference for comedies, which could be relevant if the conversation shifts to that genre. Furthermore, point 5 that Speaker B used to teach Film Studies can add depth to their credibility as a movie enthusiast. However, point 6 about Speaker A enjoying \"Coming to America\" is not yet applicable to the current context since the dialogue context suggests Speaker A plans to watch it next. Overall, the MEMORY provides relevant and connected information, though not every point directly supports the current dialogue flow."
