Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment.  Speaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n2. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n3. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n4. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n5. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n6. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fantastic news! I'm really happy for you. And yes, I was actually thinking of starting with some simple origami animals soon. Your skills are really inspiring!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could help Speaker B generate a proper next response. Specifically, it highlights Speaker A's enjoyment and skills in origami, including past successful projects like making a Lotus flower and a 3D modular swan. Additionally, it mentions that Speaker B has an interest in making origami animals, which could tie into the current conversation about Speaker A's contest and Speaker A's inquiry about Speaker B's interest in trying origami. However, the connections between sentences could be stronger, and some details, such as Speaker A volunteering at a hospital, don't directly contribute to the ongoing conversation about the origami contest or future plans. Overall, the MEMORY has some helpful elements but lacks a clear and cohesive connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
