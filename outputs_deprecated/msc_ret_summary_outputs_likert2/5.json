Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there? Speaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay? Speaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately? Speaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"' Speaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n2. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n3. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n4. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n5. Both Speaker A's mother and Speaker A were librarians, but Speaker A is retired.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It's a detailed account of the Civil War battle at Gettysburg with a focus on the strategies and key figures involved. Even if you're not into history, it's a gripping read! Let me know if you want to borrow it before your trip.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information, such as Speaker B's adventurous plans contrasting with Speaker A's quieter breaks. It highlights Speaker B's upcoming trip and their excitement about it, which ties into the discussion about plane tickets to Costa Rica. Additionally, the mention of Speaker A and Speaker B's sense of humor might help in continuing their dialogue in a light-hearted manner. However, the MEMORY lacks detailed, connected, or causal information that could strongly guide Speaker A's next response; for instance, the specific relevance of Speaker A's past as a librarian is unclear. Therefore, while there is some helpful context, it's not dominant or well-connected to the current dialogue context."
