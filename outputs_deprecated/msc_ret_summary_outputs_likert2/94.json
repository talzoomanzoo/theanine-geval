Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know.  Speaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like. Speaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too. Speaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you? Speaker A: Just my doggy Drunky.  You never know,  I might meet a nice lady out there.  Speaker B: Totally.  There will be a bunch of women there and it'll be easy to strike up conversations.  Just be confident and I'm sure you could walk away with a bunch of numbers. Speaker A: Oh, I definitely will. Thanks for the motivation. Is this going to me your first festival?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n4. Speaker A enjoys going to bars and loves the ladies.\n5. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.\n6. Speaker A is a guitar player and values jam time over social time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, it will be my first festival with a baby on the way. I'm excited to share the experience with my growing family.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of useful information that could help Speaker B continue the conversation in a meaningful and contextually relevant way. It mentions Speaker B's wife is pregnant, which is relevant to the context of potentially staying in a cabin for comfort, and it also gives insight into Speaker A's personality and interests, such as enjoying bars, playing guitar, and interacting with women. These details could be used by Speaker B to craft a response that acknowledges these aspects of Speaker A during their ongoing conversation about the festival. The MEMORY does a good job linking useful background details to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which allows for a continuation of relevant topics, though it could more explicitly connect how these memories influence the current planning for the festival. Nonetheless, the coherence and relevance of the MEMORY to the CONTEXT warrant a rating of 4."
