Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n2. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n3. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n4. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n5. Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n6. Speaker A enjoys the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for a language model representing Speaker B. It confirms that Speaker A works at a restaurant, finds it busy but enjoyable, and that Speaker A gets two free meals per week and often brings home leftover baked goods. This context complements the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A is excited about a new dish added to the menu at work. However, while these aspects are somewhat relevant, they do not provide deep causality or direct linkages to excite a next response specific to the new dish being added. The MEMORY outlines several aspects of Speaker A's work life, but none explicitly connect to the excitement and the new menu item, which reduces the relevancy and causal clarity needed for a higher score."
