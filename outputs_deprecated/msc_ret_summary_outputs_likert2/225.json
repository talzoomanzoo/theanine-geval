Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, certain foods can definitely have healing properties! I personally find that incorporating a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables into my diet really helps with overall health and well-being. Have you ever tried essential oils or meditation for healing purposes?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, memories like Speaker B's interest in healing (memory #1) align with Speaker B's mention of finding healing fascinating in the context. Additionally, memories #2 and #3 about Brazilian food relate to the mention of Brazilian foods enjoyed while watching Black Widow. However, the memory doesn't provide much causality or clear development between Speaker A and Speaker Bâ€™s interactions beyond these points. Some other memories like Speaker A's brother's preference for Brazilian food or Speaker A's involvement in healing work are not directly connected or developed in the context of the conversation. This makes MEMORY only partially helpful for Speaker A in generating further relevant dialogue for the current exchange."
