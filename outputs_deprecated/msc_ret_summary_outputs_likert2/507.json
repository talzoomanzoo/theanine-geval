Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "raw_prediction": "No, I haven't been fishing lately. I miss being out on the water, it's so relaxing. I wish I had more time for both surfing and fishing.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some pieces of information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it provides an insight into Speaker B's interests, such as fishing and a willingness to surf. There is also some information about Speaker B's current situation: working at a doctor's office limits their time for surfing. Additionally, aspects of Speaker A's background, such as their beach upbringing and nickname, are mentioned. However, the MEMORY could be improved with more cohesiveness and clear connections outlining the resourcefulness of this information in crafting meaningful responses in the current dialogue. While some connections are clear, others, like Speaker B's possible willingness to get surfing lessons, could be more directly tied to the current conversation to enhance the dialogue flow and support future interactions."
