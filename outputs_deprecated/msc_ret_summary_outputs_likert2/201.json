Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing?

    "raw_prediction": "I actually dyed my hair back to its natural color a few weeks ago. I figured it was time for a change. But I'm glad to hear your daughter is getting more interested in Greek mythology. It's such a fascinating subject to explore together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains specific details about both Speaker A's and Speaker B's interests and their travel plans. For example, the MEMORY notes Speaker B's interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology, which aligns with the context as Speaker B mentions wanting to prioritize a trip to Greece. It also mentions Speaker A's travel plans and connections in Europe, which is relevant since Speaker A discusses planning a trip to Italy and being in contact with friends in Europe. The MEMORY also mentions Speaker B's passion for Greek mythology, which ties back to Speaker A's inquiry regarding sharing this interest with Speaker B's daughter. However, some pieces of information, such as Speaker A buying a dress for Easter or studying history through documentaries, while potentially interesting, donâ€™t directly contribute to the immediate conversation and might be less relevant to forming the next response. Overall, the MEMORY is quite helpful in understanding the speakers' past interactions and interests, though it could be slightly more connected with current conversational topics."
