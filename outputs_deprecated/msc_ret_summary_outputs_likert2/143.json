Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food? Speaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A's pet raccoon enjoys eating pizza.\n2. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature.\n3. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid.\n4. Speaker B has two terrier dogs as pets.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for music and plan to have a house concert with their pets.\n6. Speaker B asks Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information, especially regarding Speaker A's pet raccoon named Journey, which directly links to the dialogue context about Journey eating a piece of pizza. This helps in understanding the situation and potential difficulties Speaker A faces with their pets. The mention of both speakers having pets and Speaker B asking about a pet raccoon in the past could also be somewhat relevant, as it may indicate a history of discussing or dealing with animals. However, the MEMORY contains information that is less directly connected to the current dialogue context, such as the planned house concert or Speaker A's bearded dragon named Sid, which are not pertinent to the specific issue being discussed (i.e., pets getting into food). Additionally, some details like Speaker B having two terriers may not directly impact the generation of the next response in this context. Overall, while there is some helpful information, not all components of the MEMORY are directly useful for the immediate dialogue problem, and the connections between the sentences could be clearer."
