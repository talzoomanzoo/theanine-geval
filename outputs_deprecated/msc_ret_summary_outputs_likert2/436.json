Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work? Speaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol Speaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise?  Speaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n3. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n4. Speaker A is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock.\n5. Speaker A plans to bring sandwiches and fruit for the hike, specifically asking about veggie sandwiches for Speaker B.\n6. Speaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! You have a real passion for nature and the outdoors, so I think you'd make an amazing park guide. Don't underestimate yourself; sometimes taking a chance on something you love can lead to unexpected opportunities. Who knows, maybe you'll end up leading hikes near the same trail where I'll be working at the grocery store!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant details about Speaker A and Speaker B that could be helpful in understanding their current conversation's context better. For example, memory 1 about the grocery store being near a hiking trail, and the fact that Speaker A is a recent high school graduate looking for jobs aligns with their excitement in securing the job. However, there's a lack of coherence in how each memory point connects, which could enhance the context's relevance. The details about camping gear, hiking, and preferences in sandwiches could help with future conversations, although they don't directly enhance this specific dialogue. The connection between Speaker B's aspirations with the park system could have been made stronger, and the comments about Speaker B's friend and store have low immediate relevance. Overall, while informative, the memories are somewhat scattered and require a bit more cohesion for better relevance to the conversation at hand."
