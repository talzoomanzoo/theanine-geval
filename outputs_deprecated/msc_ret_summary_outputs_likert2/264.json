    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment.  Speaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon? Speaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think? Speaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus! Speaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing? Speaker A: Yea, I think for the more complicated origami it's kind of a use it or lose it but for the simple stuff you can usually take a couple months of and still remember to do it! Did you see origami in Japan?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n2. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n3. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n4. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n5. Speaker A wishes to visit the country where origami was originally created, possibly Japan.\n6. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "No, I haven't been to Japan yet, but it's definitely on my bucket list. I can imagine how amazing it would be to see origami in its cultural birthplace.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A's skill in origami and their offer to teach Speaker B (points 1 and 2). It also reflects their interest in complex origami, like the Lotus flower (points 3 and 4). However, points 4 and 5 have slight inaccuracies or contradictions (e.g., Speaker A's interests about the Lotus flower), which may cause confusion. Thus, while the MEMORY is somewhat helpful, it needs better coherence and relevancy to improve its score."
