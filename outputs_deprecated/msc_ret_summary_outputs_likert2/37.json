Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't!

Speaker B: I mean I always recommend Karate since that's what I study! I can bring you by the dojo sometime if you want to see what it is like.  Speaker A: OMG!! That would be so awesome, Yes please.  When is a good time for you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate.\n2. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.\n3. Speaker B practices karate and works as a lifeguard but is looking for a different career.\n4.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of information about Speaker B that are somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as their background in karate (points 1, 2, and 3) and football (points 1 and 4). This information could help in understanding Speaker Bâ€™s perspective and qualifications while discussing karate and recommending it to Speaker A. However, the MEMORY also contains some unrelated details, such as Speaker B considering IT work or being a lifeguard, which do not contribute to the conversation. The details about Speaker A studying marketing and their shared interest in languages are unrelated to the context of martial arts. Overall, the MEMORY lacks a direct connection between the details provided and the specific conversation about trying out karate classes, hence not entirely supportive for generating a coherent follow-up response."
