Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand. Speaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  Speaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n2. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n3. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n4. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments.\n5. Speaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\n6. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker B is interested in making the fishing trip an annual tradition (sentence 1), aligning with the current context of planning the trip. Additionally, it gives background on Speaker B's experiences with their grandkids (sentence 2), which could relate to engaging them in future fishing trips. Sentence 3 reflects Speaker B's enjoyment of spending time with grandkids, further supporting the idea of planning outings like the fishing trip. Sentence 4 suggests the challenge Speaker B faces in engaging their grandkids, hinting at potential reasons for promoting activities like the fishing trip. Lastly, sentence 5 clarifies Speaker B's generational perspective, and sentence 6 provides context about Speaker A's limited availability due to work. The memory offers relevant background and causal relationships, but it could be more directly connected with the current topic of planning different locations for the fishing trip."
