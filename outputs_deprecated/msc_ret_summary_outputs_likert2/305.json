Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? Speaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month Speaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation? Speaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n2. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n3. Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they go to the zoo every few weeks.\n4. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo.\n6. Speaker A enjoys seeing pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker B's interest in adopting a kitten and their enjoyment of visiting the zoo, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they discuss going to San Diego and visiting the zoo. The mention of the kitten aligns with the opening of the conversation regarding adopting a kitten from a friend. However, not all sentences in the MEMORY contribute to the current context or show a natural causality or development of events. Several facts, such as those about Speaker A's and B's hobbies and interests, are less directly relevant to the immediate conversation. The inclusion of Speaker B's girlfriend and Speaker A's sister visiting the zoo with them lacks direct connection to the context. Overall, while there are relevant points, the connections between sentences could be more clearly demonstrated to enhance the contextual flow."
