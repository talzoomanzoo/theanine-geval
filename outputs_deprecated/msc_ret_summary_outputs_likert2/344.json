Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that? Speaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading? Speaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha. Speaker B: Well if it's any good I know you'll be watching the whole thing. Speaker A: you know it.  And I know that you would just fall asleep during it whether it's any good or not. Speaker B: Is there a lot of violence in your book? I couldn't stand to read it if there was. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n2. Speaker B has a son and enjoys reading books, particularly about animals.\n3. Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.\n4. Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys watching movies with them.\n5. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n6. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "There is quite a bit of violence, but it adds to the suspense. I can see why you prefer your peaceful animal books instead.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about the preferences and interests of Speakers A and B, which can be useful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it highlights:\n- Speaker B's enjoyment of animal books, which relates to the current dialogue where Speaker B mentions preferring animal books over crime dramas.\n- Speaker A's enjoyment of reading and watching Netflix, relevant to the discussion about the book and potential movie adaptation.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY also contains less relevant information (e.g., Speaker A watching Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars, the number of grandchildren) that does not directly connect to the present context or significantly aid in generating the next response. Additionally, the MEMORY could be more cohesively structured to show clearer causality or development related to the specific dialogue interactions, which would improve its helpfulness."
