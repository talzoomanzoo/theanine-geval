Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.\n2. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate.\n3. Speaker B practices karate and works as a lifeguard but is looking for a different career.\n4. Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork.\n5. Speaker A is studying marketing and enjoys it.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both have interests in learning new languages.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I have also dabbled in Taekwondo in the past. The kicks are quite different from Karate but I enjoyed learning new techniques.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about Speaker B's involvement in karate and other activities, such as a background in football, which might suggest an inclination towards sports. Sentence 4 offers a relevant piece of information connecting football to karate, which might be useful in generating a response related to martial arts. However, several sentences in the MEMORY are less pertinent to the immediate context of martial arts, such as their interest in going back to school for IT work or lifeguarding, which do not directly aid in producing a relevant follow-up on martial arts. Additionally, the connections between these sentences are loose, lacking a clear causal or developmental narrative related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
