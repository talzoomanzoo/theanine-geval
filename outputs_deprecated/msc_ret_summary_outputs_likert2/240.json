Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates.\n2. Speaker A enjoys reading books about ice cream, Disney World, and computers.\n3. Speaker A works for a small local business with a demanding schedule.\n4. Speaker A considers quitting their job to work at Disney World.\n5. Speaker A is 27 years old and hopes to change careers soon.\n6. Speaker A is considering a career in dentistry but is also interested in working at Disney for happiness.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: MEMORY contains relevant information that could help Speaker A generate a response. Specifically, points 4, 5, and 6 indicate that Speaker A is contemplating a career change and their interest in Disney, which could be relevant in responding to Speaker B's question about their job. However, the memory could be better structured to show clear connections and development. For example, while there's information about Speaker A considering a career in dentistry and wanting to work at Disney, it's unclear which is the more likely option or if these thoughts impact their current job satisfaction directly. Additionally, while memory point 3 describes a demanding schedule at a small business, it lacks further context on how it affects Speaker A's career aspirations related to Disney or dentistry, so the flow of connected past interactions could be improved."
