Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it! Speaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's husband enjoys Disney sports movies, such as 'Miracle'.\n2. Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good.\n3. Speaker B's kids enjoyed watching 'Luca' and said it was good.\n4. Speaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids.\n5. Speaker B recommends Speaker A to watch 'Miracle'.\n6. Speaker A has seen the Disney movie 'Luca' recently.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful context for generating Speaker A's next response in the dialogue. It includes information about Speaker B's family's enjoyment of Disney movies, which is relevant to the discussion about \"Miracle.\" Key details such as Speaker B's husband and kids liking Disney movies can be useful for Speaker A in continuing the conversation, possibly by discussing other Disney movies or exploring recommendations. The memory is mostly well-connected and relevant to the context, although some details, like Speaker A having seen \"Luca,\" are less directly connected to the main topic of \"Miracle.\" Overall, the MEMORY offers helpful information for maintaining the flow of conversation."
