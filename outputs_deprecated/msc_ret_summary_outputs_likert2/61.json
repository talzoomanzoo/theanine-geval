Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?

Did you go to the zoo last weekend? Speaker A: I see. Yes, I did make it to the zoo.  Have you gone to your local zoo?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n2.

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, we have been to our local zoo a few times. My daughter loves seeing all the animals, especially the monkeys.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that can aid Speaker B in generating an appropriate response in the conversation. Key details such as Speaker A's frequent visits to the zoo and enjoyment of tigers and monkeys could help shape Speaker Bâ€™s response, especially when discussing zoo visits. Similarly, knowing that Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo and is interested in monkeys offers a natural connection point with the preceding dialogue. Additionally, Speaker B's interest in family discounts can fuel a follow-up question or statement on future visits. The sentences in MEMORY are well-connected, supporting the narrative and helping facilitate a continuous conversation."
