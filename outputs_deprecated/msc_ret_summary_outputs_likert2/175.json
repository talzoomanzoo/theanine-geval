Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you? Speaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has a government job that pays the bills but wishes they could work in interior design.\n2. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n3. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n4. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.\n5. Speaker B is not entirely satisfied with their job and wishes it was more rewarding.\n6. Speaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies, which influenced Speaker B's favorite genre.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear that you're enjoying producing horror movies. It seems like you have a talent for it, and it's awesome that it brings you fulfillment. Have you thought about exploring opportunities to transition into that field full time?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives background on Speaker B's current job and interests, specifically noting their involvement in producing horror movies and dissatisfaction with their current job (points 1, 2, and 5). These details help inform Speaker A's understanding of Speaker B's situation and can guide the conversation towards Speaker B's creative pursuits. Additionally, the MEMORY includes information about Speaker A's interests (points 3 and 4), which could influence how Speaker A responds. The connections between sentences are relatively clear, especially regarding the influence of Speaker B's father on their interest in horror movies (point 6). However, while all points are relevant, some connections could be more explicitly demonstrated, which is why the score isn't a 5."
