Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing? Speaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from? Speaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there. Speaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat?  Speaker A: I've thought of a lot of  names, but in the end it will probably depend on the breed and the sex.  \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n2. Speaker A is considering getting kittens and thinks rats can be smart.\n3. Speaker B is in college, paints on the side, and has five dogs and three rats.\n4. Speaker A prefers adopting pets from shelters rather than from breeders.\n5. Speaker B has 5 dogs of different breeds and has rats as pets but didn't include them in the portrait.\n6. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy the company of their pets and think they are smart and playful.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's true, the name should definitely suit the cat's personality and characteristics. I'm sure you'll pick the perfect name once you meet your new furry friend at the shelter. Good luck with your search!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of relevant information that are helpful for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it captures Speaker B's interest in Persian cats and their pets having interesting interactions (point 1), which aligns with Speaker B's comment about painting a portrait of their great dane and pet rat. This could be relevant for expanding the conversation about pet portraits or animal interactions.\n\nFurthermore, MEMORY points about Speaker A considering getting kittens (point 2) and preferring to adopt from shelters (point 4) are relevant since Speaker A is planning to visit a shelter for adopting a cat. This helps to create continuity between previous interactions and the current discussion about adopting pets and naming the new cat.\n\nAdditionally, the information about Speaker B painting on the side (point 3) and having multiple pets (points 3 and 5) connects logically with their mention of painting pet portraits, providing context for their interest and personality. The shared appreciation for pets being smart and playful (point 6) could be helpful if the dialogue shifts towards discussing pet behavior or stories.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is well-structured, with natural sentences that provide context and relevance to the ongoing dialogue, hence a score of 4. It could be improved slightly by tightening the focus on the immediate context concerning the cat adoption and naming discussion."
