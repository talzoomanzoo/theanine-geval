Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended.  Speaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along! Speaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them. Speaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me! Speaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler. Speaker B: Ah yes, that's my favorite time of year. Oh and speaking of Tasha, I'm still amazed she knows Mandarin. Have you been learning more of the language?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n2. Speaker A has a pet named Tasha who speaks Mandarin.\n3. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n4. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n5. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot.\n6. Speaker A's parrot Tasha has seen cats before and ignores them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't been actively learning more Mandarin, but I've been trying to reinforce the words Tasha already knows. It's always impressive to see her pick up new phrases!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains multiple facts about Speaker A's parrot Tasha, including the fact that she can speak Mandarin and that she has seen cats before and ignores them. These details are somewhat helpful as they align with parts of the Dialogue Context related to Tasha and the plan of adopting kittens. However, some entries like Speaker B's intention of giving kittens Mandarin names or filling out adoption paperwork are not relevant to what we have seen in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and don't help in generating the next response. Additionally, the sentences are somewhat repetitive and do not form a cohesive narrative, reducing the overall helpfulness of the MEMORY."
