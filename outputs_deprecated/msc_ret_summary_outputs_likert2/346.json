Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n2. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n3. Speaker A has a kitten from their cat and enjoys taking them on trips.\n4. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n5. Speaker A usually leaves their cats with a friend while traveling.\n6. Speaker B loves dogs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically regarding Speaker A considering the name Marmalade for the kitten, which is now being replaced with Pumpkin. The MEMORY includes details about Speaker A's other cat named Ginger and Speaker A's plans for the new kitten, which maintains some relevance to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the extra details in MEMORY about Speaker B's preferences and Speaker A's travel habits don't directly connect to the naming decision mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the sentences in MEMORY don't fully capture the precise development or causality of past interactions related to the current context but are somewhat naturally connected around the theme of cats."
