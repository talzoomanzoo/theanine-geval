Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting! Speaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow? Speaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from. Speaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same. Speaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal. Speaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab! Speaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n2. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n4. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n5. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n6. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides a few pieces of useful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the connections between the MEMORY and the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT are only moderately helpful. Here is the breakdown:\n\n1. The mention of Speaker B working on weekends at a research lab and their interest in neuroscience (Memory 4) is marginally relevant because it ties to the broader conversation about lab work and Speaker B's involvement in scientific fields, such as cloning.\n2. Speaker B planning to major in molecular biology (Memory 6) supports their involvement in scientific experiments, relevant to the conversation about cloning in the lab.\n3. Connections about food, including hamburgers and cooking (Memory 1, 2, and 5), have some relevance to the discussion on cloned and plant-based burgers. However, the specific nostalgic preferences discussed (like Speaker Bâ€™s famous hamburgers or the casserole) do not provide much more context that is already present in the dialogue.\n4. The fact that the speakers are involved in different fields of work (Memory 3) provides some general background but doesn't significantly aid in formulating a specific response to the current context of the conversation, which is focused on cloning and food preferences.\n\nOverall, while there are a couple of useful connections, there is not a strong causality or direct relevance established in most MEMORY sentences to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, so the score reflects moderate helpfulness."
