Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know.  Speaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like. Speaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n4. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.\n5. Speaker A is a guitar player and values jam time over social time.\n6. Speaker A frequents live band venues and plays music at home.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great plan! It will be nice to have some jam time together at the festival.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker B's wife's pregnancy, which could explain Speaker B's interest in a more comfortable accommodation (like the cabin) instead of traditional camping. This connection aids in understanding the conversation's context and motivations. Additionally, it establishes both speakers' shared interest in bluegrass music (point 2), which is central to the discussion about attending the festival. Points 4 and 6 extend the context by providing insights into the personal circumstances and preferences of the speakers, which could influence their decision-making regarding the festival. However, some details, such as Speaker A's preference for jam time over social time, might not be immediately relevant to generating the next response based on the given context. Nonetheless, the MEMORY is overall well-connected and relevant, justifying a high score."
