Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n3. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\n4. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n5. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking.\n6. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY effectively supports the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides relevant details about Speaker B's planning stage for an Alaskan trip, indicating that they haven't planned much and are uncertain about available activities beyond hiking. This information naturally connects to Speaker A's question about new ideas for the trip. Additionally, the MEMORY highlights Speaker A's familiarity with Alaska and outdoor activities, including fishing, hiking, and the state's cold and snowy landscape, hinting at the possibility of ski slopes. This background can help the language model (representing Speaker B) generate a relevant and informed response about possible activities, showing a clear causality and relevance to their ongoing conversation about the Alaskan trip."
