Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok?  Speaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n2. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n3. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n4. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n5. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n6. Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Sure thing! It's called Mediterranean Stuffed Bell Peppers. I think you'll love it with your taste for Mediterranean food. Looking forward to sending you that pic!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a background on Speaker A's connection to the restaurant, which is relevant because Speaker A is discussing the addition of a favorite dish in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Knowing that Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets free meals weekly gives context to their excitement, though it doesn't directly help with continuing the specific conversation about the new dish. Speaker A's work schedule and the fact that Speaker B loves Mediterranean food aren't directly relevant to the current exchange, although the food preference may lightly connect to the theme of restaurant and food discussions. Overall, while MEMORY contains some helpful elements giving insights into Speaker A's job, it doesn't significantly enhance the ability to generate the next immediate response in the conversation."
