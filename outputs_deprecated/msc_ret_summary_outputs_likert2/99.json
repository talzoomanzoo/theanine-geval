Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make? Speaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it. Speaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\n2. Speaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally.\n3. Speaker A enjoys cooking and finds it helpful for stress relief.\n4. Speaker A plays the drums and loves making food for others.\n5. Speaker A cooked steak, fried potatoes, and shrimp for dinner with their father.\n6. Speaker A enjoys surfing and offers to give Speaker B lessons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Sure, I'd be happy to teach you how to make it! Cooking together could be a fun experience. Let's plan a cooking day soon.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that could potentially help Speaker B generate a proper next response in the dialogue context. Points 1 and 2 are directly connected to the current conversation about cooking, with Speaker B enjoying cooking, valuing a specific recipe, and Speaker A liking to cook and follow recipes. This information could be used by Speaker B to suggest bonding over cooking or learning more about each other's cooking preferences.\n\nHowever, other parts of the MEMORY, like points 3, 4, 5, and 6, are less directly relevant to the current context about cooking spicy foods. While they provide background details about Speaker A, such as stress relief from cooking or interest in surfing, they don't contribute much to the development of the current conversation. Additionally, there is no direct causality or strong natural connection between memory points that would enhance the flow of dialogue or add significant depth to the interaction based on past events. Therefore, although some helpful information is present, the MEMORY on the whole is only moderately helpful for generating a next response in the context given."
