Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you. Speaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n2. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n4. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n5. Speaker A plays the clarinet in a band concert and has a solar investment for their office building.\n6. Speaker A's parents are teachers.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds beautiful! I'll definitely consider adding plum and pear trees to my garden. Thank you for the suggestion.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful background information that could guide Speaker A's response to the suggestions made by Speaker B. For instance, Speaker B's knowledge about plants and gardening (point 1) directly relates to the dialogue context where Speaker B is giving gardening advice. Furthermore, Speaker A's struggles with gardening (point 2) could influence Speaker A's response to desire more detailed or beginner-level advice. However, other points like Speaker A joking about space weeds (point 4), playing the clarinet (point 5), and family background (point 6) are less relevant to the immediate context and do not naturally connect to the conversation about gardening. Overall, the MEMORY hints at useful information relative to the ongoing dialogue but lacks consistent relevance throughout."
