Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is an artist who walks through nature for work.\n2. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n3. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks.\n4. Speaker A recommends the new album by Highly Suspect to Speaker B.\n5. Speaker A is a fan of the Game of Thrones series and enjoys audiobooks.\n6. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker B that could help Speaker B generate a proper response. Notably, the fact that Speaker B is an artist who finds inspiration during nature walks (Memory points 1 and 3) is directly relevant to the dialogue context, which mentions a nature walk. This connection can prompt a natural conversation about nature walks as a source of inspiration.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY also contains information that is less immediately relevant to the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, Speaker B's love for certain book series (Memory point 3) and Speaker A's music recommendation (Memory point 4) or interest in series (Memory point 5) don't naturally connect with the specific context of a nature walk, unless there's an effort to relate them in the conversation. While these details could be interesting, they don't directly pertain to furthering the current dialogue context without additional context or interaction development.\n\nThe MEMORY could be more helpful if the connections between the information and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT were stronger or more extensive."
