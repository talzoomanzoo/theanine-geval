Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you? Speaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses. Speaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set? Speaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up. Speaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe? Speaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n2. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.\n3. Speaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies, which influenced Speaker B's favorite genre.\n4. Speaker A prefers classic horror movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th over modern ones.\n5. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n6. Speaker B's dad works on smaller projects and has never been involved in a major Hollywood film.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's probably a wise choice to stay away from the fake blood mixture. Safety first, right? It's all part of the magic of movie-making, but definitely better to leave that to the experts.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information about Speaker B, which can be useful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, the fact that Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad (points 1 and 3) could be relevant to the ongoing conversation about horror movie production. This information builds on Speaker B's interest in horror movies, as discussed in the context. However, the information about Speaker A's preferences for classic horror movies and mid-century design (points 4 and 5) is less directly relevant to the specifics of the current conversation, which is more focused on the production and behind-the-scenes aspects of horror movies. Points 2 and 6 provide context about Speaker B's background and preferences, but they do not add immediate value to the discussed topic of the conversation. Overall, while the MEMORY has some relevant information, its cohesiveness and direct relevance to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT could be stronger."
