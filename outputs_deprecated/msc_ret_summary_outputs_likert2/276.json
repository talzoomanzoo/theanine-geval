Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it!

I love all my students, because they really get into the lectures and ask lots of questions. Yes, my job requires me to watch movies all the time, so that is how I find the best ones. Is your programmer job going all right lately? Speaker A: That sounds amazing. Super lucky to have students that really enjoy what they are learning about and I’m sure that’s down to the way you teach and what you teach them. I’m so glad it is all going well for you. Yeah it is going much better now, I’m really getting in the swing of things thank you for asking.  Speaker B: You're welcome. So, returning to the subject of Pulp Fiction, did you think it was funny?

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a good amount of helpful information that can aid Speaker A, represented by a language model, to generate a suitable next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, MEMORY points 2 and 3 correlate well with Speaker B's role in the context, as they confirm that Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and that they used to teach Film Studies. These details naturally relate to Speaker B's job as a film professor, which they mentioned in the dialogue, enhancing the comprehensiveness of the conversation. Additionally, points 1 and 4 highlight Speaker A's interest in movies and reliance on Speaker B's recommendations, aligning with the topics in the context about movie suggestions. Lastly, even though points 5 and 6 provide some personal interest information about Speaker B that doesn't directly link with the immediate context, they still offer background that can guide the development of future dialogue interactions. The memory structure effectively supports the dialogue causality and relevancy, hence a score of 4."
