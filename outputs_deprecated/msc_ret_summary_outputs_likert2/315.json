Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think? Speaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons Speaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n2. Speaker A's favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, saying \"for you I shall live\".\n3. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n4. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n5. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n6. Speaker B enjoys fishing and wishes their wife and sons could have joined them on the trip.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'll definitely keep that in mind. It's important to make it meaningful and personal. Plus, it will be a great conversation starter if I ever decide to get one.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some potentially useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives background about Speaker A's existing tattoos and their sentimental value, such as the tattoo dedicated to their late father (Memories 1, 2, and 3). This context may help Speaker B relate to or understand more deeply the importance of the tattoo for Speaker A's mom, suggesting continuity in their memorial tattoos. It could facilitate Speaker B in further encouraging Speaker Aâ€™s choices.\n\nHowever, a few pieces of information, such as Speaker A working at a coffee shop, though related to saving for the tattoo, and Speaker B's enjoyment of fishing (Memories 4, 5, and 6), do not directly support a response relevant to tattoos or continue the topic flow naturally. Thus, while some parts of the MEMORY are connected and relevant, others do not assist much in generating a focused continuation of the identified conversation about tattoos, maintaining a mid-level helpfulness score."
