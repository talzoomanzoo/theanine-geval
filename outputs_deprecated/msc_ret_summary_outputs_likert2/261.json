    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment.  Speaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon? Speaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n2. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n3. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n4. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n5. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n6. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I think origami can be both easy and challenging, depending on the complexity of the design you're trying to create. But with practice and patience, anyone can learn and enjoy it! I'd be happy to teach you some basic origami techniques and we can work our way up to more intricate designs like the lotus flower I recently made.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could help Speaker A generate a response. Point 1 specifically connects to the context of Speaker B wanting to learn origami from Speaker A, which is directly related to the dialogue. Additionally, points 2 and 6 mention Speaker A's experience with origami, which could serve as helpful background information to support Speaker A's ability to teach Speaker B. However, points 3 and 4 seem contradictory regarding Speaker A attempting to make a lotus flower, which may cause some confusion. Furthermore, although parts of the MEMORY relate to the context, not all points naturally connect with the dialogue flow or offer a clear sense of causality. Therefore, a moderate score is appropriate."
