Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships! Speaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field? Speaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n2. Speaker B is looking for internships in the sports medicine field and has asked professors for letters of recommendation.\n3. Speaker B is interested in sports medicine and enjoys surfing.\n4.

    "raw_prediction": "I have about a year left until graduation. I'm really looking forward to potentially joining my college's soccer team as well. It's been a dream of mine to combine my passion for sports with my studies in sports medicine.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clearly shows that Speaker B is interested in sports medicine and is actively seeking internships, which aligns with the opportunity mentioned by Speaker A. The MEMORY mentions Speaker B asking for letters of recommendation, enjoying surfing, and playing soccer, which helps in understanding Speaker B's character and interests. Moreover, Speaker A's past advice and encouragement about the internship and surfing being a connection-making opportunity are informative. However, the connection between surfing as a networking strategy and the ongoing conversation about internships could be better emphasized for a perfect score."
