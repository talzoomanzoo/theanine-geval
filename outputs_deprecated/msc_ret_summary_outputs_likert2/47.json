Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career. Speaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday. Speaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n4. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n5. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n6. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you, that means a lot! My parents are supportive, but they just want me to do what makes me happy. I'm sure your parents feel the same way about your decision to pursue teaching. It's important to follow your passion.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that could assist Speaker A in generating a more informed and personalized response in the dialogue context. For example, memory points 1, 4, and 6 underscore Speaker A's interest and current involvement in computer science and teaching, closely connecting with the dialogue subject about teaching and career aspirations. Moreover, memory points 3 and 5 reveal Speaker B's inclination towards an academic career and volunteer work, offering potential discussion points that are naturally relevant to careers, education, and teaching. Although the MEMORY does not explicitly mention the specific stress or the advice session discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, overall, it contains sentences representing past interactions and aspirations that are connected and relevant to the conversation. The causal relationships between past activities and future aspirations are evident, making it helpful for determining a suitable response."
