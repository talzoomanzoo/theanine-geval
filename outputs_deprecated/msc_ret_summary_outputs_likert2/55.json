Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n2. Speaker B has a young daughter who is 8 years old and is becoming independent.\n3. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n4. Speaker B's daughter likes monkeys and is starting to assert her independence.\n5. Speaker B is away from their child and glad that the pets are with them.\n6. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, she had a great time! She loved seeing all the animals, especially the monkeys. She's really starting to assert her independence, so she had a blast exploring the zoo on her own.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY partially provides helpful information for generating a response. Here's why:\n\n1. **Relevance**: The MEMORY contains relevant details about Speaker B and their daughter's interest in visiting the zoo, which is directly related to the trip mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, the MEMORY mentions that Speaker B is pushing for a school trip to the zoo, the daughter wants to visit the zoo to see the monkeys, and the daughter likes monkeys and is becoming independent. These details can be related to the trip Speaker A is asking about.\n\n2. **Connection**: There are connections between the sentences, such as the daughter's desire to see the monkeys and her growing independence. These elements can form a coherent picture of Speaker B's interactions with their daughter.\n\n3. **Lack of Causality**: However, the MEMORY doesn't provide clear causal connections or developments from past interactions beyond the mention of the daughter's preferences. Some parts are less relevant, such as Speaker B being away from their child, and don't directly aid in generating a specific response.\n\n4. **Inclusion of Speaker A**: The memory includes one irrelevant detail about Speaker A, which does not enhance the conversation flow based on the current context.\n\nOverall, while there are relevant details in the MEMORY, some elements don't directly support generating a meaningful or directly causative response as strongly as they could. Therefore, a score of 3 reflects this partial help."
