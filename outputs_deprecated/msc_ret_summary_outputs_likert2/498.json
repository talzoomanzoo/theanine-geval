    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician.\n2. Speaker A enjoys surfing and music as a way to escape from daily life.\n3. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend.\n4. Speaker A is part of a band that tours different countries for their music.\n5. Speaker A wants to see Sublime live one day but doesn't go to many concerts other than the ones their band plays in.\n6. Speaker A was good at writing in school, while Speaker B was bad at math and preferred fishing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's cool! Rock music is definitely a great way to escape from the daily grind. Have you been to any concerts recently?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information about Speaker A's involvement in music, which is directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT question about playing an instrument. Points 1, 3, and 4 provide specific details that Speaker A is in a band and plays the drums, which might be useful for generating a follow-up response related to music or band activities. However, some of the information, like Speaker A enjoying surfing, is less directly tied to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, and thus not all sentences are equally helpful. Despite this, the majority of the MEMORY is relevant and naturally connected, clearly demonstrating the relationship between Speaker A's musical activities and their conversations, leading to a good score."
