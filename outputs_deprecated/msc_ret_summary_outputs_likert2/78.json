Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me? Speaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights.\n2. Speaker B found flights that work for their schedule and price and will be visiting Speaker A in a couple of weeks.\n3. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\n4. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n5. Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n6. Speaker A has visited Alaska and describes it as beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT; for example, it mentions Speaker B planning to visit Speaker A, which aligns with the current discussion about airfare and tickets. Additionally, it covers the planning for activities during the trip, such as going on tours and attending folk concerts, which could potentially inform future conversations.\n\nHowever, the structure of MEMORY could be improved. There are several repeated points, such as the invitation and excitement for the visit (points 1, 3, and 5), which do not provide new or deeper context. Furthermore, the mention of Speaker A visiting Alaska (point 6) seems unrelated to Speaker B's current intention to visit, thereby not directly aiding the response generation. Overall, while MEMORY provides some useful context, it lacks a coherent narrative and includes irrelevant information."
