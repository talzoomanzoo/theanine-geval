Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A. Speaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now? Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done.  Speaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n2. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n3. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n4. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n5. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n6. Speaker A wishes to get better grades and is hopeful for a soccer scholarship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information for generating responses in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it highlights that Speaker A struggles with history (1) and typically finds it boring, which connects with their initial comment about getting a B in history and feeling like with more studying, they could have gotten an A. This information can help to deepen the context of Speaker A's struggles with the subject. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions Speaker A's wish for better grades and hope for a soccer scholarship (6), which could be relevant in discussing their academic goals beyond the current exam period.\n\nHowever, many parts of the MEMORY focus on Speaker B's background in sports medicine (2, 4, 5) and academic pressure, which does not clearly connect to the current dialogue where Speaker B is supportive of Speaker A's performance and seems focused on the immediate topic of finals. Moreover, these mentions of sports medicine do not seem to contribute much to the ongoing conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, thus lessening the overall helpfulness of the MEMORY in this scenario.\n\nWhile the MEMORY does contain some connected and relevant sentences, the distribution of helpful information across both speakers is uneven, limiting its overall applicability in generating appropriate responses."
