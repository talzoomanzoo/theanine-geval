    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends? Speaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do. Speaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars. Speaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there,  Speaker A: You'd have to get some serious blackout curtains for when it was daylight lol! You'll have to stock up on some warm essentials before heading out. You definitely don't want to get stuck in a bad situation in the cold, especially if you're alone. I bet they have great ice cream! You'll have to tell me about it when you get back! Speaker B: Yeah, I need to call my friend and find out what season they are in so I can pack accordingly. I will take pictures of the ice cream too so I can tell you about it. I wonder if there are a lot of bears there? I don't like bears either. Speaker A: I'm pretty sure they have grizzlies up there. You better pack something to fend them off too just in case. I bet your friend knows everything you'd need to keep them away. Speaker B: I will bring whatever they let me bring on the airplane, but I am really counting on my friend to help me out with the local customs lol. Do you know if Rocky and Bullwinkle were from Alaska?  Speaker A: No, they were from Minnesota. Are you going to have your friend be your hiking guide? Speaker B: I invited my friend to come stay at the lodge where I'm vacationing and he said it would be fun to get away for a bit. So I'm hoping he will show me around for a week or so. I might have to hire a hiking guide, it depends on how much he knows about hiking and grizzlies I think. What do you think? Should I hire someone?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n3. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\n4. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet.\n5. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking.\n6. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It's great that your friend is joining you for part of the trip! I think having a guide could be a good idea, especially if they know the area well and can ensure your safety while hiking. It's always better to be cautious, especially in a place like Alaska with its wildlife.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information, but it could be better structured and more helpful. The context of the dialogue is primarily about Speaker B preparing for a trip to Alaska, where they want to do sledding with dogs, experience either the dark or light seasons, try the local ice cream, and possibly go hiking while considering hiring a hiking guide. \n\nThe MEMORY captures some aspects like Speaker B planning a trip to Alaska and having not yet fully planned their activities. It also notes that Speaker B is uncertain about what else there is to do besides hiking, which connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, some elements mentioned in MEMORY do not directly align with the current conversation topics or are out of context, such as the focus on hiking activities (point 1 and part of point 3). Additionally, the information provided could better describe the development of both speakers' past interactions regarding the trip. \n\nOverall, the MEMORY could improve by providing more directly relevant details and connecting those with the natural progression of the conversation."
