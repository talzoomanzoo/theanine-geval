Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. Speaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price? Speaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music Speaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n3. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n4. Speaker B bought 20 lotto tickets with the same numbers, aiming to get a bigger share of the jackpot if they win.\n5. Speaker B's children have been sick, and Speaker B also had a fever, possibly influencing their decision to buy 20 lotto tickets.\n6. Speaker B believes that luxurious items distract from the value of their family.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, winning the lotto would definitely make things easier. But I'd still enjoy the music even if I don't win.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information that is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. In the context, Speaker B mentions winning the lotto as a hypothetical solution to Speaker A's issue with the expense of their new iPhone. The MEMORY contains several references to both speakers' interest in and previous discussions about the lottery, which could naturally connect to the current conversation about winning the lotto to help with the expense. However, the MEMORY also includes details such as the specific number of tickets bought by each speaker and the recent ailments of Speaker B's children, which don't directly contribute to generating a next response related to the dialogue. Additionally, while the thought that luxurious items distract from family could relate to the conversation about expenses, it's tangential and not clearly connected to the immediate topic."
