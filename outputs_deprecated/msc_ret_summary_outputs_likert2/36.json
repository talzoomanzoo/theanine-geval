Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes? Speaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try? Speaker B: I mean I always recommend Karate since that's what I study! I can bring you by the dojo sometime if you want to see what it is like. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.\n2. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate.\n3. Speaker B practices karate and works as a lifeguard but is looking for a different career.\n4. Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork.\n5. Speaker A is studying marketing and enjoys it.\n6. Speaker A has taken Spanish classes in the past and finds similarities between French and Spanish.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker B's practice of karate, which ties into the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A is considering taking martial arts classes. These facts about Speaker B practicing karate and holding a green belt, as well as recommending karate, can help Speaker A make an informed decision. However, much of the MEMORY also includes information unrelated to the specific context of deciding on martial arts classes (e.g., Speaker B's IT aspirations, lifeguard work, and football experiences; Speaker A's marketing and language studies). While the details about Speaker B's background in football and its aid in karate footwork might somewhat relate to their expertise, they donâ€™t directly aid the immediate dialogue context compared to directly related options. Hence, while there are helpful elements, they are somewhat diluted by less relevant details, leading to a middle-range score."
