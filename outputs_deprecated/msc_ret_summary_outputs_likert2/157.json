Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended.  Speaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along! Speaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them. Speaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n2. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n3. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot.\n4. Speaker B has two sick kitties and recently received a rescue.\n5. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n6. Speaker A's parrot Tasha has seen cats before and ignores them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains quite a few helpful information for Speaker A to generate a relevant response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. The first two points in the MEMORY establish that Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten, which are valuable background information directly related to the conversation. \n\n2. Point 3 adds more detail, informing that Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens, suggesting that they are serious about adopting even with the parrot's presence.\n\n3. Points 4 and 5 provide context for Speaker B, sharing that they have two sick kitties and are in the process of adopting rescue kittens, even considering naming them based on their personalities. This can help Speaker A form more personal responses or inquire about the kitties as a follow-up.\n\n4. Lastly, point 6 provides insight into the interaction between Speaker A's parrot and cats, showing past experience with pets coexisting, aligning with the topic of the dialogue.\n\nHowever, some repetition and slight discrepancies (point 3 suggesting a request for training tips while the conversation doesn't explicitly mention it) can slightly hinder its full usefulness. Nonetheless, the MEMORY remains mostly cohesive and relevant to the given CONTEXT."
