Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food? Speaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too? Speaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also? Speaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways? Speaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy? Speaker A: I think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has penguins at the zoo and enjoys working with animals, offering Speaker B a chance to help out.\n2. Speaker B has elderly terriers and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one.\n3. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature.\n4. Speaker A works at a zoo and is willing to help Speaker B get an entry-level position there.\n5. Speaker A mentions that entry-level positions at the zoo involve cleaning enclosures and feeding less dangerous animals but offer decent pay, training, benefits, and assistance with schooling.\n6. Speaker A works at a zoo and has tried playing music for the white tigers and home concerts for their pets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, it was the warehouse job. I just needed a break before starting something new. And yes, it can be challenging with older animals, but they bring so much joy to my life.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that could potentially be helpful in expanding the conversation or providing context for Speaker B's responses. For example, the fact that Speaker A works at a zoo and discusses entry-level positions could be relevant to the current dialogue if the conversation were to shift towards career opportunities or job satisfaction. However, the current context is primarily focused on the pets' behavior and managing them, rather than career topics. Additionally, the information about Speaker B's plans to leave a part-time job or their admiration for Speaker A's dogs does not directly connect to the current dialogue, making the MEMORY only sporadically relevant. The sentences in the MEMORY describe various elements from previous interactions, but they don't naturally connect or directly correlate to the ongoing dialogue about handling pets or commentary on work-life balance, reducing its overall helpfulness."
