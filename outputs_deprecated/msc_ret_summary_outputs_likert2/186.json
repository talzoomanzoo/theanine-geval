Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n2. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n3. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n4. Speaker B is on their way to college and studying sports medicine.\n5. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n6. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information that can be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It informs us that Speaker B is involved in sports medicine and excels in it, which could be relevant if the conversation shifts towards Speaker B's academic strengths or their future studies. Additionally, it tells us about Speaker A's struggle with history and generally maintaining good grades, which is directly connected to the context as the current topic is about exams and school performance.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY also contains content that might not be immediately relevant or connected to the dialogue about history exams, such as Speaker B feeling pressured by their mother's expectations or their future college plans. These details do not directly contribute to forming a coherent response related to the current conversation. Additionally, while the MEMORY provides a background on the academic coping mechanisms and aspirations of both speakers, these details could be better incorporated if the current dialogue was directly exploring personal academic challenges or aspirations. Overall, the MEMORY has useful pieces of information, but the connection to the current context could be more explicit and relevant."
