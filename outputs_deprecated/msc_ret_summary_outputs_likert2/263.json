Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment.  Speaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon? Speaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think? Speaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus! Speaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n2. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n3. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n4. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n5. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue.\n6. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for Speaker A to generate a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\nPositive aspects:\n- It is beneficial to know that Speaker A has experience with origami and has successfully made a Lotus flower (point 2) because this can contribute to the conversation about the difficulty of origami and demonstrate Speaker A's skill level.\n- The fact that Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami (point 3) aligns well with the dialogue context where they discuss getting together for origami.\n- Knowing that Speaker B is interested in making origami animals (point 6) provides context about their interests, which can guide Speaker A's suggestions or responses.\n\nNegative aspects:\n- Point 4 contains conflicting information, as it mentions Speaker A is interested in making a lotus origami \"next,\" which contradicts point 2, where they have already made it.\n- Points 1 (craft room learning location) and 5 (volunteering and origami hobbies) do not directly contribute to generating a next response. Although interesting, they are not directly relevant to the current dialogue.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides a fair amount of context but could be improved by more directly aligning with the current dialogue context and consolidating contradictory information."
