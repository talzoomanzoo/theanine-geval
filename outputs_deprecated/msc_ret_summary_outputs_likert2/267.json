Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment.  Speaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon? Speaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think? Speaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus! Speaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing? Speaker A: Yea, I think for the more complicated origami it's kind of a use it or lose it but for the simple stuff you can usually take a couple months of and still remember to do it! Did you see origami in Japan? Speaker B: Not up close, but I noticed a lot in shop windows in certain areas. I love Japan -- they're so welcoming. One of our acquaintances GAVE me a kimono. She said it's customary to try to share their culture. Kind of different from America in my opinion.   Speaker A: Oh, that sounds wonderful. It's impressive how much things that came from there and how giving a culture they are. America is definetly a lot different from them, have you visted different states in America? Speaker B: Oh yes. I live in North Carolina, but I've been to almost every state. Alaska was by far my favorite, but I'm kind of a loner and it feels like a lot of people there are, so maybe I just relate. But the scenery and landscapes are unbelievably beautiful. What's your favorite place you've been to?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A wishes to visit the country where origami was originally created, possibly Japan.\n2. Speaker B has visited Japan and found it to be an amazing country.\n3. Speaker B was recommended volunteering by Speaker A and has traveled to Japan and Italy, enjoying the art and food.\n4. Speaker A met someone at the hospital who visited Italy and enjoyed the art museums and restaurants there.\n5. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n6. Speaker B enjoys traveling and visiting gardens.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't traveled as much as you have, but I would say my favorite place so far has been Italy. The art museums and restaurants there are just incredible.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant pieces of information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, Speaker B's visit to Japan (Memory 2) is mentioned explicitly in the dialogue, which helps establish context about Speaker B's experiences and interests. Memory 5 is also relevant as it directly aligns with the dialogue where Speaker A offers to teach origami to Speaker B.\n\nHowever, the connections between the sentences in MEMORY are somewhat loose and do not provide a holistic or naturally flowing narrative. There is mention of travel to Italy (Memory 3 and 4), but these details are not directly pertinent to the current dialogue since the discussion is centered around traveling within America and origami, without a focus on Italy. Moreover, the sentence about Speaker B enjoying visiting gardens (Memory 6) does not directly connect to the current dialogue context, which revolves more around personal accomplishments, origami, and travel. Therefore, this MEMORY contains elements that are relevant but lacks a cohesive structure where all memories naturally contribute to generating the next responses in the dialogue."
