Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand. Speaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  Speaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery Speaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library?  Speaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done Speaker B: Well if you ever need someone to come and help for a couple of hours here and there, give me a call, you know how much I love to be in the library anyway Speaker A: I will keep that in mind as we do have volunteer hours available. How is your family doing these days? Speaker B: Well I would be happy to help. My family are all great thank you for asking I took the grandkids to the park again we had a great time. How's your family doing? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n2. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n3. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n4. Speaker A sees parents bringing in their little kids to the library as encouraging.\n5. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n6. Speaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that aligns with the complexities and topics discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes relevant data about Speaker B's relationships with their grandkids (e.g., spending time at the park and planning fishing trips) and Speaker A's life (e.g., being busy with work, having children, and views as a librarian). These connections to the context can aid in generating responses tied to the topics of family, grandchildren, and balancing work with personal time. Certain MEMORY points such as Speaker Bâ€™s fishing experience with their grandkids, and Speaker A's appreciation for seeing kids in the library connect to the ongoing themes of family activities and the interaction with children. The information about Speaker A being a librarian and their love for kids facilitates discussions around work and family topics. However, certain details in the MEMORY, such as Speaker A's difficulty balancing work and family, could have been expounded for further usefulness. Overall, MEMORY is coherent and mostly relevant, hence the score."
