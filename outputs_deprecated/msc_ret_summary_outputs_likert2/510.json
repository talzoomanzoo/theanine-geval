    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments.\n2. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n3. Speaker A's other children are addicted to tablets and phones, unlike the youngest one who is interested in music.\n4. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n5. Speaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both acknowledge the decline in interest and use of libraries due to the rise of the internet.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It's a tough balance, isn't it? Sometimes the traditional ways of communication just feel more personal. But it's great that you're making the effort to stay connected with your family, even with your busy schedule.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker B's relationship with their grandkids and Speaker A's challenges with balancing work and family time. Notably, it mentions Speaker B having grandkids who prefer modern technology over traditional activities like music, offering insight into Speaker B's reference to preferring phone calls. Additionally, it hints at Speaker A's struggle with work-life balance, relevant to their use of technology for communication. However, not all points directly contribute to understanding the current dialogue, and some points about speaker A's children's interests and library usage are less connected and substantial. The MEMORIES could benefit from more coherence and clearer causality to better support generating responses in the immediate context."
