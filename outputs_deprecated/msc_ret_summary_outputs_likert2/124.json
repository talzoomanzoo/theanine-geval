Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!

Speaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain? Speaker A: I think age has really been my knees downfall. I also used to hike a lot and I put a lot of pressure on my legs. That is great that you only have a year. Maybe when you graduate you can come hang out on the beach with me. I can't surf but I would love to watch you. Speaker B: That would be fun!  I like collecting shells too so we could do that as well.  I have a small collection of ones I have from around the world.  The farthest away was from Greece.  Have you traveled a lot?\n\nMEMORY:\n1.

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't traveled much, mainly because of my knees. But it sounds like you've had some amazing experiences! That's awesome you collect shells, I have a few from different beaches myself. Maybe we can compare collections sometime.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as details about Speaker B's interest in sports medicine and their need to find internships, as well as the interactions around the beach and surfing. However, there are inaccuracies or lack of clarity in the causal relationships presented. For example, Speaker A does not suggest surfing as a way to make connections in the medical field in the given context. Additionally, some memories, such as Speaker A hiking along the coast, do not align with the context where they mention their knees not handling much pressure, leading to confusion. The MEMORY provides some helpful context, but not all details are helpful or natural in their relevance to the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
