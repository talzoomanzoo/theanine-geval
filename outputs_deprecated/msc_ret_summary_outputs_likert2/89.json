Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know.  Speaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n2. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n4. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.\n5. Speaker A frequents live band venues and plays music at home.\n6. Speaker B agrees to look at Speaker A's Subaru Legacy for the funny noise it makes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's so thoughtful of you and your friend! We would really appreciate the offer to stay at the cabin. Thank you so much for arranging that for us.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information helpful for Speaker A to generate a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that both speakers enjoy bluegrass music, which supports the context of discussing a bluegrass show. The MEMORY also mentions Speaker B's wife being pregnant, which adds understanding to the conversation about needing a comfortable place to stay and considering day attendance at a festival. Additionally, the MEMORY covers previous logistics discussions regarding attending a festival with a baby, which is directly relevant to the offer of using the cabin. However, not all parts of the MEMORY are directly relevant to the current context, such as Speaker A playing music at home or the discussion about the Subaru Legacy. These details do not add much to the specific topic at hand. Therefore, while the MEMORY is helpful, some elements do not directly support the context."
