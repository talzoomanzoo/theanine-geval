    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week? Speaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you? Speaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions? Speaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n2. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n3. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n4. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n5. Speaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies.\n6. Speaker A does not play video games often but may consider trying them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains somewhat relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it lacks a strong natural connection and clear development of past interactions. \n\n1. Points 1, 4, and 5 in the MEMORY are directly related to the current conversation, as they address Speaker A's preferences for video games, their plan to try Resident Evil, and their hesitance towards scary games. This information is useful for Speaker A's next response, especially when talking about their gaming preferences and needs for suggestions.\n\n2. Point 2 provides some assistance that could help if the conversation shifts back to playing strategies or tips. However, this hasn't been focused on in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\n3. Point 3 introduces details about Speaker B's gaming habits and recent purchase, which could be relevant for establishing context in future interactions, but it doesn't offer immediately useful information for generating a next response in the current conversation flow.\n\n4. Point 6 introduces a tidbit about Speaker A's broader gaming habits but doesnâ€™t connect explicitly to their current needs or to the ongoing dialogue, hence less helpful for shaping an immediate next response.\n\nOverall, while there is relevant information in MEMORY, it doesn't closely follow the dynamics of the current conversation, leaving room for improvement in cohesiveness and how naturally the sentences interconnect to illustrate the speakers' past interactions."
