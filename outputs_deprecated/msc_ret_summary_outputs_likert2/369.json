Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. Speaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?   Speaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession.\n2. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n3. Speaker A works at a stable and enjoys being around horses.\n4. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n5. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n6. Speaker A is involved in horse breeding and taking care of horses.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It's great that you find therapy in riding your horses. Horses have a unique way of connecting with people and can be really therapeutic. If you ever decide to try therapy, I'd be happy to help guide you through the process.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for Speaker B to generate a proper next response in the dialogue. Points 1 and 5 are directly relevant as they confirm Speaker B's profession and interests, which can be helpful in crafting responses with shared personal information. The mention of Speaker B's enjoyment in his profession (point 1) is directly reflected in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enhancing continuity. However, points 2, 3, 4, and 6 are less connected to the current dialogue context and do not provide a clear causality or relevance to Speaker B's next response regarding Speaker A's consideration of therapy. Thus, while there is helpful information, the MEMORY lacks strong connections, causing a mixed relevance to the dialogue context."
