Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer? Speaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods.\n2.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that supports generating an appropriate response for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, sentences 1, 2, 4, and 5 are helpful as they establish that Speaker A is interested in music concerts and museums, and is planning to visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo, which connects well with Speaker B's question about what sort of art museum Speaker A is going to. Sentence 3 provides context on Speaker B's interest in summer music concerts, which aligns with the conversation topic on concerts. Sentence 6 gives additional background on Speaker B's lifestyle preferences relevant to the city context, which can relate to the ongoing conversation about concerts and museums. However, some connections could be more explicit to earn a perfect score."
