Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it! Speaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to? Speaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you? Speaker B: I have been relaxing with the kids as much as I have. My husband has been busy with work, so we haven't had time for anything big. I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before? Speaker A: I have never gone to Italy because I'm always so busy. If I ever go, I would want to spend a month there, but work has been hectic lately. Would your kids go with you if you went to Italy? Speaker B: Absolutely! I'd love to travel all over the world with my family to see everything. Hawaii sounds like just as much fun though. What are you most excited about doing when you get there?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has seen the Disney movie 'Luca' recently.\n2. Speaker B's kids enjoyed watching 'Luca' and said it was good.\n3. Speaker A has booked a \"Hawaii Sunset\" tour for next month, being excited about it being their first time.\n4. Speaker A works two jobs and struggles to make time for themselves, but still manages to plan a trip to Hawaii.\n5. Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good.\n6. Speaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm most excited about the sunset tour in Hawaii. I've never been able to take time off for a proper vacation, so this will be a much-needed break.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that reflects the development of interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B, such as Speaker A watching the Disney movie \"Luca\" and Speaker A planning a trip to Hawaii, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY also contains information that is either redundant (e.g., Speaker B's kids enjoying Disney movies, which is already mentioned in the dialogue) or not explicitly mentioned in the dialogue context (e.g., Speaker A working two jobs). The causality and relevancy are not consistently demonstrated throughout the MEMORY, leading to a more moderate score."
