Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. Speaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession.\n2. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n3. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n4. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n5. Speaker A works at a stable and enjoys being around horses.\n6. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "No, I haven't tried therapy before. I mainly work with horses and enjoy being around them. It's interesting to hear about your experiences as a therapist.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information about Speaker B being a therapist, which aligns with the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides background on Speaker B's experience and general thoughts about their profession, which can be useful in generating a follow-up response. However, some details in the MEMORY, like Speaker B supporting the Chiefs or considering Freudian theories, are not directly useful for the conversation at hand. Additionally, while Speaker A's work with horses might be relevant if the conversation proceeds in that direction, it does not yet connect with the current context about therapy. Hence, while the MEMORY contains helpful elements, not all information is fully relevant or necessary for the immediate context."
