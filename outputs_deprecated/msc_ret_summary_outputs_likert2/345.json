Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that? Speaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading? Speaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha. Speaker B: Well if it's any good I know you'll be watching the whole thing. Speaker A: you know it.  And I know that you would just fall asleep during it whether it's any good or not. Speaker B: Is there a lot of violence in your book? I couldn't stand to read it if there was.  Speaker A: There's a little bit.  Mostly just when describing how the crimes occurred though.  There are also some fight scenes between the cops and the criminals.  It's not too bad.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n2. Speaker B has a son and enjoys reading books, particularly about animals.\n3. Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.\n4. Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys watching movies with them.\n5. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n6. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I can handle a bit of action, but I prefer to read about animals peacefully roaming in the wild.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information about Speaker B's interest in animal books, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B expresses their preference for animal books over crime dramas. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions Speaker A's interest in watching Netflix, which connects to the context where Netflix is mentioned as potentially adapting the book into a movie. However, many of the MEMORY entries are repetitive regarding Speaker A's grandchildren and do not provide additional helpful information beyond what is necessary to understand the context. Furthermore, some entries like \"Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren\" do not connect naturally or causally with the conversation about books and movies. Thus, while the MEMORY is somewhat helpful in giving context to the interests and past interactions of the speakers, it is not comprehensive or deeply insightful to the current context of the dialogue."
