Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know.  Speaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like. Speaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too. Speaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you? Speaker A: Just my doggy Drunky.  You never know,  I might meet a nice lady out there.  Speaker B: Totally.  There will be a bunch of women there and it'll be easy to strike up conversations.  Just be confident and I'm sure you could walk away with a bunch of numbers. Speaker A: Oh, I definitely will. Thanks for the motivation. Is this going to me your first festival? Speaker B: No, I used to go to them all the time.  This will be my first one in a while and probably my last since my wife and I are about to have our baby.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n3. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.\n4. Speaker B is not going out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n6. Speaker A enjoys going to bars and loves the ladies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's so exciting! Enjoy the festival while you can, and make the most of it before the baby comes. Parenthood is a whole new adventure waiting for you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information, such as Speaker B's wife being pregnant and her impact on their festival plans. This is helpful because it sets context for why Speaker B might be interested in a cabin close to the festival for a comfortable stay and a day visit. Additionally, the facts that Speaker B is not going out drinking much and enjoys bluegrass music align with the context that both speakers are discussing attending a bluegrass festival. However, some sentences in MEMORY, like Speaker A's love for bars and ladies, don't directly enhance or inform the conversation, and there is some disconnection between statements, lacking a natural progression or interaction history between Speaker A and Speaker B. These aspects diminish its helpfulness for generating the next response."
