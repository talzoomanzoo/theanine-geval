Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it.\n2. Speaker A is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active, enjoying martial arts.\n3. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\n4. Speaker A is enrolled in a class on the history of martial arts and is majoring in athletic training.\n5. Speaker A is a martial arts teacher and student and is pursuing an athletic training degree in college.\n6. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but the connections between sentences are not entirely clear or well developed, which affects the overall helpfulness. \n\n- Sentences 1, 2, and 4 are particularly relevant because they connect directly to Speaker A's interest and enjoyment in martial arts, which aligns with the context where Speaker A mentions having a blast at a martial arts class.\n- Sentence 3 provides additional context about Speaker B, which might be useful in crafting a response that acknowledges Speaker B's interests, although remains somewhat peripheral to the immediate dialogue.\n- Sentence 5 introduces Speaker A as a martial arts teacher and student but doesn't strongly connect to the immediate context involving a class and enjoyment.\n- Sentence 6 summarizes shared interests between Speaker A and Speaker B, which aids the memory's utility but may not directly aid in generating a specific next response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT statement.\n\nOverall, MEMORY is somewhat helpful in indicating shared interests and Speaker A's passion for martial arts, but the lack of stronger logical connections or progression in these experiences through the sentences limits its helpfulness score to a 3."
