Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work? Speaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n3. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n4. Speaker A is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock.\n5. Speaker B's neighbor, John, is getting divorced and selling top-of-the-line camping gear.\n6. Speaker A will use the money earned from the store to buy the hammock online.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great that you found a side gig with John! It's always nice to have some extra cash coming in. Maybe I'll have to ask him about his side projects too.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided is mostly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives additional background on Speaker A's job application and provides context for their excitement about the grocery store job, such as the location being near a hiking trail and Speaker A's recent high school graduation. This information reveals relevant aspects of Speaker A's circumstances and goals. MEMORY also provides helpful and related information about Speaker A's interest in camping gear. Speaker B’s background about working with John, who is selling high-quality camping gear, adds to the context and shows possibilities for Speaker A’s camping gear search. This kind of information helps maintain a coherent progression of the conversation. While the MEMORY is relevant, not all details are crucial for generating the next response, which is why it is not rated a perfect 5."
