Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n2. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n3. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue.\n4. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n5. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n6. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a good amount of relevant information about Speaker A's interest and experience in origami, which is helpful for generating a contextually appropriate response. Specifically, point 1 shows that Speaker A enjoys origami and has made a Lotus flower successfully. Points 2 and 3 describe Speaker A's self-taught learning and specific preferences in making origami, such as the 3D modular swan with glue. Point 4 indicates Speaker A's willingness to teach, showing a development of the relationship with Speaker B. It helps to provide context to Speaker A's skill level and commitment to origami, which aligns well with the origami contest achievement mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nHowever, there are slight discrepancies (e.g., point 6 mentioning trying to make a lotus origami next, despite point 1 stating Speaker A already made it), which reduce coherence and impact the clarity of Speaker A's progress or current interests. Despite this minor inconsistency, the MEMORY largely supports generating responses that acknowledge and build upon Speaker A's origami-related accomplishments and interactions with Speaker B."
