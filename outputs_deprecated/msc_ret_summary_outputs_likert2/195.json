Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A. Speaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now? Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done.  Speaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on? Speaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study? Speaker B: Ah, English should be easier than History. Sure, I can help you. What do you need to do exactly? Write an essay? Speaker A: Yeah, we have to write an essay and we have a spelling component towards the end of the exam, I sure could use a little help! Speaker B: No problem! I like correcting and editing essays. Although, it seems like your English is pretty good. I doubt you even need much help. Speaker A: Excellent, thank you for taking the time to help me out a little. I would like to get an A!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A wishes to get better grades and is hopeful for a soccer scholarship.\n2. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n3. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n4. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n5. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n6. Both speakers value good grades and believe it can lead to better job opportunities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker A and Speaker B's academic interests and struggles, which could be helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance:\n\n1. MEMORY Sentence 4 mentions Speaker A's struggle with history, which is relevant to the discussion of their recent history exam.\n2. MEMORY Sentence 6, which notes both speakers' value for good grades, connects to their discussion about achieving good exam results.\n\nHowever, many MEMORY sentences focus on aspects not directly connected to the context, such as soccer scholarships, sports medicine, and physical education. These points do not provide immediate assistance for generating Speaker B's next response related to studying and preparing for the English exam. There is also some lack of apparent causality or relevance between certain MEMORY sentences, although some connections are visible around academic pursuits. Therefore, while the MEMORY is somewhat helpful, it does not provide a cohesive, directly useful narrative for the immediate dialogue."
