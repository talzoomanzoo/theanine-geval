Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. Speaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B believes that luxurious items distract from the value of their family.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n4. Speaker B appreciates the convenience of city living but also values what the country has to offer.\n5. Speaker A used to live in a suburb of DC and misses the convenience of city life.\n6. Speaker B is open to moving to the country to be further away from neighbors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains information about Speaker A and Speaker B's personal values and past interactions, but it does not offer anything particularly helpful for generating a proper next response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context involves a specific discussion about a new iPhone purchase and its cost, and the MEMORY does not directly relate to this subject matter.\n\n1. Sentence 1 mentions Speaker B's belief about luxurious items, which is somewhat tangentially related to the iPhone conversation, but not directly helpful.\n2. Sentences 2 and 3 provide background on the relationship and activity (lotto tickets) but aren't relevant to the current dialogue context.\n3. Sentences 4, 5, and 6 about city vs. country living provide background but do not connect to the iPhone topic.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY lacks direct relevancy and connectedness to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, thus providing minimal assistance for response generation."
