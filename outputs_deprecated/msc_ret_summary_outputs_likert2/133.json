Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting! Speaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow? Speaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from. Speaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n3. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n4. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n5. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n6. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I've actually tried a Beyond burger before and I was pleasantly surprised by how similar it tasted to a traditional beef burger. It's amazing how far plant-based alternatives have come in replicating the taste and texture of meat. I would definitely give it a try again!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains some useful information that can help generate a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, sentence 5 points out that Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology, which is relevant given Speaker Bâ€™s interest in the lab mentioned in the dialogue. Sentence 6 also shows Speaker B's interest in science, which aligns with their enthusiasm for lab work discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, not all sentences in the MEMORY are directly relevant, such as sentences 1, 3, and 4 about hamburgers and other foods, which don't have a direct connection to the cloning or lab work discussed. The sentences about Speaker B preparing dishes and diner work might be of some contextually loose interest (like the plant-based discussions), but do not show direct causality or relevance."
