Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer? Speaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to? Speaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.

Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle? Speaker A: No, but I have been to Disney World in Florida.  I love fireworks too.  I want to get married on the 4th of July.  That was we will have a national holiday and fireworks for us every year!  It sounds like you've been to Disneyland?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A loves Disney music.\n2.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that can be useful for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Details such as Speaker A enjoying museums and being interested in music concerts connect with the current conversation about the concert and the museum. Moreover, Speaker A's visit to the Museum of Art of São Paulo is slightly related to their interest in museums, but it is not directly linked to the specific museum mentioned in the context. There is also some general information about both speakers living in the city, which could help Speaker B relate to Speaker A's experiences. Overall, the MEMORY could be more useful if it contained more details relevant to the current conversation; however, it does contain some applicable information."
