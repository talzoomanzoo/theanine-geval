Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods. Speaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about? Speaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America. Have you seen any of those movies? Speaker B: No I haven't seen any of those. What foods did you eat while watching the movie?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and their brother enjoy going to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner.\n2. Speaker A's brother enjoys Brazilian food, specifically steak.\n3. Speaker A plans to grab dinner with their brother before dancing.\n4. Speaker A enjoys salsa dancing and is planning to go out dancing.\n5. Speaker B expressed interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A.\n6. Speaker B works as a bartender and enjoys meeting different people.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some potentially relevant information, such as Speaker A and their brother enjoying Brazilian food, which could relate to the recent mention of eating Brazilian foods while watching the movie. However, the memory entries are fragmented and lack direct connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it difficult to establish clear causality or relevancy for generating a coherent response. Entries about salsa dancing, healing methods, and Speaker B's job as a bartender seem unrelated to the current dialogue, reducing overall helpfulness."
