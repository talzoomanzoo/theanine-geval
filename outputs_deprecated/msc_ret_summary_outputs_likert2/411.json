Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it? Speaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see.  Speaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece.\n2. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian.\n3. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\n4. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five.\n5. Speaker A has traveled around Europe before, visiting capital cities of each country.\n6. Speaker B asks Speaker A if their trip is more for relaxation or sightseeing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The memory provides a mix of relevant and less relevant information concerning the dialogue context. On the plus side, it contains details about Speaker Bâ€™s interest in Greece (e.g., visiting the Parthenon and Acropolis, and planning a trip there) which naturally connect with the dialogue context about visiting the Acropolis in Athens. However, several sentences in the MEMORY (such as Speaker A's travel history in Europe or Speaker B's interest in Athena) are not directly linked to the ongoing conversation centered around the Acropolis visit. Additionally, the connections between sentences in MEMORY are somewhat loose, and the causality or relevancy for the current conversation isn't entirely clear or helpful for predicting future responses based on the dialogue context."
