Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods. Speaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about? Speaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America. Have you seen any of those movies? Speaker B: No I haven't seen any of those. What foods did you eat while watching the movie? Speaker A: Wow, there are so many of the movies out there. Don't go see Black Widow without watching Avengers first. I had an amazing steak and vegetables on the side that were delicious. What is you favorite food?  Speaker B: Oh ok I definitely will watch those first! I love both steak and vegetables! I am a real foodie and love just about everything that isn't too strange to try lol. Speaker A: Oh wow! Do you like sushi? I love it but the sea urchin is a little crazy lol. Have you ever eaten sea urchin? Speaker B: I have never tried sea urchin or sushi but I do like crab legs and shrimp! Do you ever consider any foods to be good for healing? I find that you do healing very fascinating! Speaker A: Yes, in fact I consider almost all foods to either be healing, harmful or neutral. In my opinion people should choose foods based on how they want to feel. Sushi is fresh and healthy so I considerate it to be very healing. Speaker B: That is very wise thinking. Which vegetables do you feel are the best for healing? Are there any that should be avoided? Speaker A: I feel that most leafy green vegetables are healthy, but it depends on the specific person's needs. For example some people need to avoid nightshades, like potatoes, etc. while other people can eat them without any problems. Overall, a diet with a variety of colors is good when it comes to vegetables\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B expressed interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A.\n2. Speaker A recommended self-massage, essential oils, reiki, meditation, and self-awareness for healing.\n3. Speaker A is involved in healing work and mentioned hot latina salsa.\n4. Speaker A's brother enjoys Brazilian food, specifically steak.\n5. Speaker A and their brother enjoy going to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner.\n6.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information that could be relevant in generating a response in the context of the conversation. For example, Speaker A's involvement in healing work and being a Reiki practitioner might be relevant since Speaker B shows an interest in healing foods. Additionally, Speaker A and their brother enjoy Brazilian food like steak, which can connect to the mention of Brazilian food in the dialogue context. However, the MEMORY also contains details that are not very connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the mention of hot latina salsa and the recommendation of self-massage, essential oils, etc., without any connection to the current conversation. While some points provide context or background that could inform Speaker B's responses, not all elements are directly relevant or helpful in this scenario, leading to a moderate score."
