Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession.\n2. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n3. Speaker A works at a stable and enjoys being around horses.\n4. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n5. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n6. Speaker B is a professional in a practice, where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker B is a therapist, which aligns with their explanation of wanting to help people in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives additional context about Speaker B's profession, like the ups and downs of the job and their practice duration, which could be useful for understanding their perspective and possibly guiding the conversation further. However, some details, like Speaker B being a Chiefs fan or the legal restrictions on client relationships, are not directly relevant to the current topic of becoming a therapist. Additionally, speaker A's enjoyment of horses isn't directly tied to the initial conversation about Speaker B's career choice. While there are some naturally connected sentences focusing on Speaker B's profession and experience, others seem unrelated or are structured in a less cohesive way."
