Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden. Speaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discussed the differences between Sweden and the US, including coffee breaks.\n4. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n5. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n6. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been saving up money for the trip, and I'm getting closer to being able to visit my cousin in Sweden. It's definitely taking some time, but I'm determined to make it happen.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information that could help generate a suitable response for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains details about Speaker A and Speaker B's joint plans to travel to Sweden, Speaker A's financial considerations for the trip, and the discussions they have previously had about Sweden's cultural aspects. These elements are relevant to Speaker A's potential progress in planning the trip since they set the groundwork for what might be updated, such as progress in savings, deciding on visiting the cousin, or additional cultural insights. However, some sentences are not directly related to the immediate plans (e.g., Speaker B's fond memories), which slightly reduces the overall helpfulness. The connections and causality among the sentences are present and fairly clear, allowing for a meaningful continuation of the dialogue about the trip to Sweden."
