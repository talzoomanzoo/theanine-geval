Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n2. Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.\n3. Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys watching movies with them.\n4. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n5. Speaker B has a son and enjoys reading books, particularly about animals.\n6. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some background information about Speaker A and B, but it lacks specific relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and is somewhat repetitive. Sentence 4 does not add new information since it overlaps with sentence 1. Sentence 5 and 6 are unrelated or not linked to the current discussion which is about a new book Speaker A is reading, specifically a crime drama, and Speaker B's preference for lighter reading. Sentences about Netflix shows and Speaker Bâ€™s preference for books about animals could be more relevant if the conversation shifted to those topics, but they don't help with the immediate context. Furthermore, information about Speaker A's 8 grandchildren and the liking for crime dramas provides a minor context, but the memory misses any direct causality or natural connection to the current dialogue about breaks and book preferences. Consider consolidating relevant information that ties to the existing dialogue to improve coherence and focus."
