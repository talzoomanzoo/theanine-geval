Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin! Speaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name?  Speaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls!  Speaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well? Speaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens. Speaker B: hehe you're right. But i can't explain that why I am not a cat person to you sorry. How's the weather like today, still good weather to have iced tea out there? Speaker A: It's beautiful. I'm sitting outside while the Spice Girls are chasing bugs in the grass. What did your kids name your cats?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n2. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n3. Speaker A has a kitten from their cat and enjoys taking them on trips.\n4. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted and humorous conversation about their pets and travels.\n6. Speaker A usually leaves their cats with a friend while traveling.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "They named them Whiskers and Mittens. They always come up with the most random and cute names for our furry friends.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful background information, such as the fact that Speaker A has a cat named Ginger and was considering naming a new kitten Marmalade. This is relevant because it connects to the current conversation about the kitten's name being changed to Pumpkin. Additionally, it mentions that Speaker B is not a cat person but takes care of strays brought home by their kids, which aligns with Speaker B's comment in the context about not being a cat person. However, not all points in the MEMORY directly relate to the current dialogue context, such as point 3 about taking the kitten on trips and point 6 about leaving the cats with a friend while traveling. These don't connect well to the immediate conversation. Overall, the MEMORY provides a moderate amount of helpful context, but not all information is directly applicable to generating a next response in the given dialogue."
