Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "raw_prediction": "You should definitely give it a try! Surfing is such a fun and exhilarating experience, it's a great way to escape from the daily grind. You could always check out some surf shops in your area for lessons, they might even have group lessons you can join.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some information that is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it lacks coherent connections and causality between the sentences. There are mentions of interests such as surfing and music, which appear in the dialogue context. However, the MEMORY does not effectively build on the specifics discussed in the dialogue, such as the focus on learning instruments and surfing, or the personal experiences and relationships tied to these activities. Instead, MEMORY contains fragmented pieces of information and background about the speakers without a clear connection to current dialogue topics. Overall, it lacks cohesion necessary to significantly aid in generating a proper next response."
