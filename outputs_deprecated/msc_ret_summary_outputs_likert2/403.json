Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad. Speaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs! Speaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours? Speaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock?  Speaker B: I guess I was going to get like an umbrella table and some chairs to go with it or maybe even a screened in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices.\n2. Speaker A recently bought new furniture for their house, including a couch, recliner, and patio furniture.\n3. Speaker A is looking to redecorate their house and likes purple furniture.\n4. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange.\n6. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a cozy setup! A screened-in gazebo with a fire pit sounds perfect for those summer nights. You'll have to show me once you get it all set up.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that connects with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as discussing furniture and home decor (point 1) and meeting up (point 5). Speaker A's interest in spending time outside during the summer (point 6) aligns with the context of planning for a barbecue. However, the MEMORY also includes details that are not clearly connected or causally linked to the current conversation, such as Speaker A's specific purchases and preferences, which are not explicitly mentioned or relevant in the given context. Moreover, some statements in the MEMORY seem to assume additional context not provided in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making the development of past interactions less clear."
