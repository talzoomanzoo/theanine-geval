Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think? Speaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons Speaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use. Speaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful? Speaker A: Most of them were not.  It really depends on where on your body you get them.  Most of mine are on areas that didn't hurt.  The one on my foot and the one behind my ear did hurt a good bit.  Where were you thinking about getting it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n2. Speaker A's favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, saying \"for you I shall live\".\n3. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n4. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n5. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B have a conversation about their personal interests and trips they have taken for work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I was thinking about getting it on my forearm. I've heard that's not too painful of a spot. Thanks for sharing your experience with me, it's helpful to know what to expect.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for understanding Speaker A's perspective on tattoos, which can aid Speaker B in continuing the conversation. Points 1, 2, and 3 offer insight into Speaker A's enthusiasm for tattoos and their significance, specifically mentioning the one dedicated to their father, which ties into the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A discusses getting a tattoo for their mom to match one for their dad. These details help Speaker B maintain a relevant discussion around tattoos and familial connections. However, points 4, 5, and 6 are less directly relevant to the current conversation about tattoos, as they introduce information about Speaker A's work and a general conversation about interests, which do not directly contribute to the flow or relevancy of the tattoo discussion. Therefore, while part of the MEMORY is helpful, the rest does not significantly aid in generating a next response, leading to a moderate helpfulness score."
