Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice.  Speaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with? Speaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think? Speaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point. Speaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.   Speaker B: I didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something? Speaker A: The rice needs to be cool before adding to the pan.  Are you able to take a passenger along in you truck?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n2. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n3. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n4. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n5. Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes.\n6. Speaker A has given a pressure cooker as a gift and uses it for recipes like lamb shanks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker B's interest in learning to cook with a pressure cooker and the fact that Speaker A is an experienced cook who frequently uses a pressure cooker, both of which are relevant to the discussion about cooking shrimp fried rice. The MEMORY also highlights Speaker B's husband's interest in Asian cooking, which ties in with the recommendation of Asian recipes. However, the information is somewhat fragmented and does not entirely address the particular issue being discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the specifics of the shrimp fried rice recipe or the technique of making rice the day before. Additionally, some details in the MEMORY, such as Speaker A's preference for Indian food, are not directly relevant to the immediate conversation. Overall, the MEMORY provides a foundation that could help inform a response but lacks some detail to be highly effective."
