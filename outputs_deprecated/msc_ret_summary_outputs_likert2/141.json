Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A's pet raccoon enjoys eating pizza.\n2. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid.\n3. Speaker B enjoys going on cruises for fun.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for music and plan to have a house concert with their pets.\n5. Speaker B is interested in taking a Disney cruise and has been watching videos on YouTube about them.\n6. Speaker A has a pet raccoon and has a friend who found baby raccoons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's hilarious! Sounds like Journey really loves pizza too. Maybe she's trying to steal the spotlight from Sid!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some potentially relevant information, such as the fact that Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey, which ties to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the raccoon eating pizza. However, much of the other information in the MEMORY, like details about Speaker B's interest in cruises, is not directly relevant to the immediate conversation about Speaker A's raccoon. Additionally, the information about plans for a house concert and the bearded dragon named Sid, while slightly related, does not necessarily help with generating the next response. The MEMORY sentences also lack clear connections or causality that would better aid in understanding the context between the speakers, hence the lower score."
