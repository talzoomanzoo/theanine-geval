Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week? Speaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you? Speaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions? Speaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like? Speaker A: I like all kinds of games. I like party, fighting, RPGs, shooters, action, adventure, and puzzle games. I enjoy playing Jurassic Park: World but I'd like to find another game to play. The storm means I'll be inside for a bit, so I think I'll curl up with some pizza and just zone out. Do you like to do anything else besides game when it's rainy? Speaker B: Well, I might help around the house with cleaning or laundry, but not that much. Mostly gaming. If I feel I sat too long, I'll switch to Nintendo Switch's Ring Fit Adventure to get my body moving a bit. Do yo know that game? Speaker A: I've heard of it. I think I need to get some exercise, so that might be a good idea. I'd like to stay in shape as much as I can. I guess games are the best way to do that! That's a good suggestion. How about you? Do you only like games like RE? What other genres do you like?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n2. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n3. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n4. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n5. Speaker A does not play video games often but may consider trying them.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy playing video games in their free time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I do enjoy a variety of genres, but I tend to gravitate towards horror and action games. I also really like playing League of Legends, and recently I've been getting into Resident Evil VIII. It's always fun to mix things up and try different types of games.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could potentially help in generating a response. It establishes both Speaker A and Speaker B's interest in video games, mentioning that Speaker A is considering trying Resident Evil, which relates to the current dialogue context where Speaker A is looking for game suggestions. However, certain details like Speaker B enjoying playing League of Legends and offering tips for Resident Evil are not directly connected to the current conversation where Speaker B has not mentioned those games or tips in the context. Also, the mention of Resident Evil VIII might be slightly confusing because it hasn't been explicitly referenced in the context, even though it is related to the game genre being discussed. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it included information more directly relevant to the ongoing discussion about game genres and activities on rainy days."
