Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it!

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe memory provides some relevant information about the speakers' interests and past interactions concerning movies, which can help generate a proper response in the context. For instance, it informs that Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies, used to teach Film Studies, and enjoys various genres, which aligns with the dialogue context where Speaker B recommends movies and talks about their job in film studies. It also mentions Speaker A's interest in movies and their reliance on Speaker B for suggestions. However, the memory contains some details that aren't directly useful for generating a next response in this particular dialogue, such as Speaker A mentioning Uma Thurman or having enjoyed \"Coming to America\" and its sequel, which weren't referenced in the context. Additionally, the memory could benefit from more explicit connections or interactions between the two speakers that directly relate to the current conversation."
