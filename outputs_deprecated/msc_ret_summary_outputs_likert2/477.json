Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?   Speaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n2. Speaker B is interested in volunteering and prefers cats over dogs, especially kittens.\n3. Speaker A loves animals, especially puppies, and visits shelters in every city they go to.\n4. Speaker B is a 26-year-old workaholic who is unsure about their career and doesn't have strong opinions on puppies.\n5. Speaker A dreams of meeting all the puppies from history when they can move through space and time.\n6. Speaker A is busy with work and used to foster puppies but no longer does.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I can see why you love puppies so much! They sound like they bring so much joy and energy. I think I might prefer the independence of cats, but I can definitely understand the appeal of puppies.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker A has a preference for dogs, particularly puppies, and has experience caring for them, which aligns with their enthusiastic description of puppies in the dialogue. It also highlights Speaker B's preference for cats, offering insight into their curiosity about the appeal of puppies. However, some details, like Speaker B's age and workaholic nature, don't directly contribute to the dialogue's current direction. Overall, the MEMORY helps to contextualize the speakers' attitudes and preferences regarding animals, particularly in terms of their interactions and responses in the dialogue."
