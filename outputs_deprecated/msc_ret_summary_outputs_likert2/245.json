Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming? Speaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both. Speaker A: That sounds interesting. That's great that you love your job, not many people do. Speaker B: Love is a strong word! I do like it though. There have been jobs I hated and I'm great full not be in that place. Hows you job going? Speaker A: Its going good. Its summer so we are really busy right now. I am just grateful to be back at work. How long have you worked for your company? Speaker B: For about four years. It's an industry in flux which is stressful. I need stability for my family at this point. It has changed my focus, which I'm not used to yet. Are you considering any other options for work?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates.\n2. Speaker A works for a small local business with a demanding schedule.\n3.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some details about Speaker A's career considerations, such as the interest in working at Disney and a career in dentistry. However, these points are not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A's focus seems more on appreciating their current job and discussing job stability. Speaker B's situation with their computer company and needing stability for their family is mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but the MEMORY does not provide connections or developments related to this aspect, aside from a vague note about Speaker B being unable to change careers until their child graduates. The MEMORY lacks coherence and fails to naturally connect the relevant past interactions with the current context, hence it offers limited helpfulness in generating an appropriate response."
