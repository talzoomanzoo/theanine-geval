    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden. Speaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways? Speaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B discussed the differences between Sweden and the US, including coffee breaks.\n5. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n6. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "There are so many beautiful places to see in Sweden! Definitely make sure to visit Stockholm for its stunning architecture and history, and maybe take a trip to the countryside for some nature adventures. And don't forget to enjoy some fika (coffee break) while you're there!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that could be useful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden, which aligns with the context where Speaker A indicates their cousin is helping with planning the trip. However, the causality or connection between some parts of MEMORY and the current dialogue is not entirely clear. For instance, while it notes that Speaker B misses Sweden and hasn't visited recently due to expenses, this information might not directly contribute to a meaningful continuation of the dialogue regarding recommendations for must-see places in Sweden. Further, the idea of traveling together, mentioned in memory point 1, wasn't addressed in the dialogue context. Thus, while some elements are related, others don't directly assist Speaker B in crafting a relevant next response."
