Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n2. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\n3. Speaker B is a member of the boy scouts and works at a fast food place\n4. Speaker B plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge for college applications.\n5. Speaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat.\n6. Speaker B is not yet in college but hopes to become an Eagle Scout.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I have definitely learned a lot of survival skills through Boy Scouts. I've had the chance to practice setting up shelter and starting a fire with minimal materials. It's been a great experience.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for a significant amount of time (7-8 years) and is currently a Life Scout. This establishes Speaker B's credibility and experience with the skills mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the MEMORY note about Speaker B planning to earn the Eagle Scout badge is relevant as it indicates a high level of commitment to scouting. These details are helpful for generating a response that ties Speaker B's experience to Speaker A's interest in introducing these skills to their kids. The MEMORY entries are naturally connected but could be improved by consolidating similar information for clarity."
