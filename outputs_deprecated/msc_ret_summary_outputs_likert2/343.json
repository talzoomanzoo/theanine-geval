Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that? Speaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading? Speaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha. Speaker B: Well if it's any good I know you'll be watching the whole thing. Speaker A: you know it.  And I know that you would just fall asleep during it whether it's any good or not.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n2. Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys watching movies with them.\n3. Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.\n4. Speaker B has a son and enjoys reading books, particularly about animals.\n5. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n6. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains several relevant pieces of information that could be helpful for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example:\n\n- \"Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys watching movies with them\" and \"Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix\" connect to the dialogue where Speaker A mentions their grandchildren and watching Netflix.\n- \"Speaker B enjoys reading books, particularly about animals\" relates directly to Speaker B's preference stated in the dialogue context for animal books.\n- \"Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals\" can help in understanding Speaker B's interests and enhancing the response regarding their preferences over fiction and animal books.\n\nHowever, some parts of MEMORY, such as \"Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch,\" don't directly contribute to generating a relevant response to the current context. Moreover, while the pieces of MEMORY are individually relevant, they lack some level of interconnectedness and smooth flow that ideally illustrate clear causality/relevancy connecting past dialogues with the current talk.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides some helpful context but could be more closely connected to enhance understanding and response generation."
