Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys Greek mythology and did a case study on Poseidon, the God of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses.\n2. Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology.\n3. Speaker A has a daughter and mentions working and having to take time off.\n4. Speaker B has a child referred to as \"the little monster\" and is a parent.\n5. Speaker B goes to the beach everyday if possible, with their 5-year-old daughter who loves to swim and play in the sand.\n6. Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, the details about Speaker B enjoying Greek mythology (Memory 1) and having a child (Memory 4 and 5) are directly relevant to the question asked by Speaker A about sharing a love of Greek mythology with their daughter. The MEMORY indicates that Speaker B enjoys sharing activities like going to the beach with their daughter (Memory 5), which could imply a willingness to share Greek mythology as well.\n\nHowever, the relevance and connection of some other details are not as strong. For instance, Speaker B's interest in visiting Greece (Memory 2) and Speaker A's fascination with Italian architecture (Memory 6) do not directly contribute to understanding the development of interactions related to the daughter's interest in Greek mythology. While the MEMORY has relevant pieces of information, a clearer connection or direct causality pertinent to the question about the daughterâ€™s current status regarding Greek mythology would improve the score."
