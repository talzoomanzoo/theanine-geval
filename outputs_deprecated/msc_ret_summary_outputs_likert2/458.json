Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well? Speaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon? Speaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now! Speaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her? Speaker A: I think so.  She seems like a very sweet girl and she seems to care deeply about my son, so that's what matters most.  You know, maybe I can stop by and visit you as well, since you live in Europe.  France, Spain, Italy?  Where are you living now? Speaker B: Bless her, that's good to hear. That would be great! I live in Portugal. It's not too far from Spain. We can always arrange something. How long would you be there for?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next.\n2. Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away.\n3. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\n4. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour.\n5. Speaker A has multiple sons, at least one of them is in a relationship with a Spanish girlfriend.\n6. Speaker A's boys are leaving again in a few months for another trip after studying abroad.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'll be in Spain for about a week, so I'll definitely have some free time to come visit you in Portugal. It would be wonderful to catch up and explore the area together. Let's plan something soon!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information but lacks clarity and connection in some areas. Here are some points supporting the score:\n\n1. Sentence 1 states that Speaker A's sons are studying in Spain and moving next to Italy; however, the current dialogue only confirms that a son is in Spain. The part about Italy might be useful if connected to the discussion about traveling throughout Europe, but it isn't mentioned in the context.\n\n2. Sentence 2 is helpful in understanding Speaker A's sentiment towards their sons, showing attachment and concern. This could guide the development of responses when discussing family matters.\n\n3. Sentence 3 provides important temporal context suggesting that Speaker A's sons are returning for winter break, which could be useful in dialogues about plans and schedules.\n\n4. Sentence 4 introduces a comparison with Speaker B's son that lacks context as it's not mentioned in the conversation and isn't essential.\n\n5. Sentence 5 aligns well, as the DIALOGUE CONTEXT mentions a son having a Spanish girlfriend.\n\n6. Sentence 6 stands alone with information about traveling, but it does not connect well with current dialogue focus (visiting Europe soon, meeting the girlfriend).\n\nOverall, while there is some useful context provided, the MEMORY lacks a bit of clarity and stronger connections to the immediate conversational topics."
