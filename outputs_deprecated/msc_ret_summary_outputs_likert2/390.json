Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast. Speaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project. Speaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on? Speaker B: I'm sure the student appreciate that. You teach as a group as apposed to one-on-one right? And one of the companies I work for had their system hit with a virus so I've been upgraded their software to debug the system.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\n2. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it.\n3. Speaker A is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active, enjoying martial arts.\n4. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things.\n5. Speaker A is a martial arts teacher and student and is pursuing an athletic training degree in college.\n6. Speaker B is busy debugging software and is a runner.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around Speaker A's martial arts class and Speaker B's work on a project related to software. The MEMORY entries are helpful as they provide background information about both speakers. \n\n1. Speaker A teaching and taking martial arts classes aligns with their enjoyment of their recent class and the context in which they discuss student numbers and teaching. \n2. It contributes to understanding Speaker A's enthusiasm for the martial arts and suggests why they might have a positive opinion of the class being \"a nice change of scenery.\"\n3. Speaker A's planning for summer courses and their status as a college student adds context to the conversation's tone and future planning.\n4. Speaker B's involvement in debugging software and software work correlates with the mention of their project and the company's system getting hit with a virus. \n\nOverall, the MEMORY helps in constructing a coherent response by providing connected background information and context, fulfilling the criterion of helpfulness with natural connections and relevancy."
