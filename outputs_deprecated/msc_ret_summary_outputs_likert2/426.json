Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone?  Speaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!). Speaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol Speaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you. Speaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up? Speaker B: Nope, I just cleared my schedule until the Alps marathon that you're training for. It's just you and me until you break that finish line. I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up. Speaker A: Wow 4 am.  Is it too late to change my mind?lol\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n2. Speaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding.\n3. Speaker A is training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover.\n4. Speaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\n5. Speaker A is a runner who is working on improving their mile time and training for a marathon.\n6. Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information and context for Speaker B to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Here’s why:\n\n1. Several points in the MEMORY are directly relevant to the current conversation. For example, points 4, 2, and 6 about Speaker B’s role as a motivational speaker align with Speaker B’s offer to motivate Speaker A for the marathon.\n2. Points that note Speaker A's training and interest in marathons (points 3 and 5) connect well to the ongoing planning and training discussion, notably the Alps marathon.\n3. The MEMORY mentions previous marathons and Speaker A’s goals, which can be useful for crafting responses that involve personalized advice and motivation.\n4. One disconnect is that some points lack a clear timeline or causality (e.g., \"meeting at the beach\"), but they do provide a generally helpful background.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY helps form a coherent basis for conversation continuity, although it could be improved by incorporating contextual links more explicitly."
