Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping? Speaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp? Speaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer? Speaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping? Speaker B: We usually do tents but we have camped in yurts too. Did you go to the zoo last weekend?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n2. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n3. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys.\n4. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures.\n5. Speaker B is interested in finding family discounts for the zoo.\n6. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information regarding Speaker A's interests in the zoo, which can be connected back to Speaker B's mention of the zoo in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the connections made between Speaker B's camping and zoo-related memories are not very strong, and the information doesn't directly enhance the specific dialogue about camping preferences and experiences. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it provided more detailed connections between camping and zoo-related interests that have been discussed in past interactions."
