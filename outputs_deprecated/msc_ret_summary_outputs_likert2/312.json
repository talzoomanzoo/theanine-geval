Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? Speaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month Speaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation? Speaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there! Speaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo? Speaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people. Speaker A: That sounds awesome.  I haven't been to the zoo in so long.  I wish I could go. Speaker B: You should go with your sister! she can bring her dog. They probably have all kinds of exotic birds... Speaker A: That's a great idea!  I'm not sure how good her dog would do around other animals though.  She always barks like crazy whenever she sees any kind of animal. Speaker B: Oh, that's a good point. Maybe keep her away from the small rodent house and reptiles, eh? Speaker A: For sure.  Hopefully she'll be more curious than aggressive.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n2. Speaker A enjoys seeing pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister.\n3. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds.\n4. Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they go to the zoo every few weeks.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo.\n6. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, hopefully she'll just want to watch them from a safe distance. It would be a fun day out for all of you!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT: it mentions Speaker B considering adopting a kitten from a friend and enjoying visiting the zoo, which aligns with the context where Speaker B talks about going to San Diego and visiting the zoo. However, the MEMORY lacks clear, naturally connected sentences that show the development or causality of past interactions. Some details, like Speaker A's enjoyment of pandas and penguins or Speaker B's girlfriend's preferences, are not directly useful for generating the next response in the context provided. Thus, the memory is somewhat helpful but not optimally so."
