Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make? Speaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it. Speaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too? Speaker B: Yeah definitely! I know you like hot foods, so if you learn and can make them fresh it will taste amazing. Have you tried any new foods lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\n2. Speaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally.\n3. Speaker A enjoys cooking and finds it helpful for stress relief.\n4. Speaker A plays the drums and loves making food for others.\n5. Speaker A cooked steak, fried potatoes, and shrimp for dinner with their father.\n6. Speaker A enjoys surfing and offers to give Speaker B lessons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I actually tried making a homemade curry dish recently, it turned out pretty good! Cooking is such a fun way to experiment with flavors.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information about Speaker A and Speaker B that could potentially be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, Speaker B's enjoyment of cooking and their specific mention of a garlic chicken recipe aligns with the discussion in the context about the garlic chicken dish. Speaker A's interest in cooking, as noted in the MEMORY, is also relevant as it ties into their suggestion of cooking together.\n\nHowever, some details in the MEMORY, such as Speaker A playing the drums or offering surfing lessons, are unrelated to the current conversation and do not aid in generating a more coherent or relevant response in the next dialogue. The information is somewhat scattered and doesn't demonstrate a clear connection or causality that would ideally inform a language model in crafting a continuation of the conversation. Therefore, the MEMORY provides some helpful context but lacks cohesiveness and relevance throughout."
