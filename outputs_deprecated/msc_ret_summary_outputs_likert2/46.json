Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career. Speaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n4. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n5. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth.\n6. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you, I appreciate your support! Teaching robotics seems like a fascinating field to get into. I hope you achieve your goal as well.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant background information that can be helpful for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker A is interested in teaching, specifically in robotics, which aligns with their expressed desire to teach robotics in the dialogue. For Speaker B, the MEMORY explains their academic pursuits in linguistics and their contemplation of different career paths, including teaching, which is directly relevant to their dialogue about career options and interest in teaching. The MEMORY includes Speaker B's interest in possibly becoming a college professor, which aligns with the teaching career trajectory discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, the MEMORY ties back well to the conversation and provides relevant insights, but it could be even more tailored to connect explicitly to the emotional and practical stresses Speaker B mentions in the dialogue."
