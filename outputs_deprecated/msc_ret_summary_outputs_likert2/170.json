Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me. Speaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway? Speaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible. Speaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most? Speaker A: I like to go hiking in the local trails here. I am familiar with them and there's so many routes that I can take. Sadly, the bugs are as bad here as they are anywhere else..... Speaker B: They can't be that bad in the fall right? I hope? Do you camp most every weekend?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks.\n2. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities.\n3. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n4. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n5. Speaker A enjoys camping trips and looking for wild animals in the woods.\n6. Speaker B dislikes bugs and is not a fan of camping, hiking, or the outdoors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I do try to camp as often as I can, especially during the summer months. The fall is actually a great time to camp because the weather is cooler and the bugs tend to be less bothersome. Maybe you'll change your mind about camping then!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, with references to Speaker A's enjoyment of hiking and camping. Sentences 1, 2, and 5 align with Speaker A’s expressed interest in hiking and camping, as mentioned in the context where they lead friends on hikes. Sentence 6 is relevant because it mentions Speaker B's dislike of bugs and the outdoors, which aligns with the dialogue where Speaker B expresses not being a fan of the outdoors.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY could be more specific and concentrated on recent events or conversations between the speakers. The information in MEMORY about planned future activities (Sentence 3) or Speaker B's recent hike (Sentence 4) doesn't directly relate to the presented dialogue context. Also, the details lack the depth that would make MEMORY thoroughly helpful, such as naming specific trails previously hiked or details about Speaker A’s preferred seasons for hiking given the bug problem. Overall, the MEMORY contains some helpful information, but its lack of specificity and limited connection to recent interactions reduce its helpfulness rating."
