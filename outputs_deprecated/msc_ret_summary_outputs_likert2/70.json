Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it! Speaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to? Speaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you? Speaker B: I have been relaxing with the kids as much as I have. My husband has been busy with work, so we haven't had time for anything big. I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before? Speaker A: I have never gone to Italy because I'm always so busy. If I ever go, I would want to spend a month there, but work has been hectic lately. Would your kids go with you if you went to Italy?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has seen the Disney movie 'Luca' recently.\n2. Speaker B's kids enjoyed watching 'Luca' and said it was good.\n3. Speaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids.\n4. Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good.\n5. Speaker A has booked a \"Hawaii Sunset\" tour for next month, being excited about it being their first time.\n6. Speaker A works two jobs and struggles to make time for themselves, but still manages to plan a trip to Hawaii.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm sure my kids would love to visit Italy with us. They enjoy exploring new places just as much as I do. But for now, I think they're just excited about our upcoming movie nights and your Hawaii sunset tour sounds amazing! Have a great time on your trip!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A's recent viewing of \"Luca\" and the booking of a Hawaii sunset tour. It captures the essence that Speaker B's kids enjoy Disney movies, which is somewhat useful since \"Luca\" is a Disney movie. However, the MEMORY could better express the mutual interest in history about \"Miracle\" that both speakers enjoy and the shared interest in possibly visiting Italy, which is significant in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY could also more clearly reflect Speaker A's busy schedule and work situation that was mentioned and tied to their travel desires during the conversation. This would enhance its helpfulness score by providing a clearer understanding of the causal or relevant connections between events or sentiments that have been expressed in the dialogue context."
