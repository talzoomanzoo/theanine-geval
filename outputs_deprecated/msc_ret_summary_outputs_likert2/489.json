Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. Speaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk? Speaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous. Speaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is an artist who walks through nature for work.\n2. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n3. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks.\n4. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n5. Speaker A asks about Speaker B's new artwork and acknowledges their need for inspiration.\n6. Speaker A enjoys reading sci-fi and mysteries, while Speaker B prefers fantasy books.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "No, I didn't bring a pet this time, but that sounds lovely. I can see how being out in nature can be so inspiring for your artwork.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains relevant information that helps in shaping a meaningful and context-appropriate response from Speaker A. It includes details about Speaker B's lifestyle, such as being an artist who finds inspiration in nature and their preference for fantasy books, which complements the ongoing conversation about nature walks and peaceful escapes. This information helps Speaker A potentially connect to Speaker Bâ€™s interests and their shared love of nature walks. Additionally, the MEMORY notes that Speaker A lives in the city and enjoys certain types of books, which could guide future dialogue directions. However, although the MEMORY is generally relevant and helpful, it could benefit from more direct connections to the specific hike components discussed in the conversation to earn a perfect score."
