Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods.

Don't go see Black Widow without watching Avengers first. I had an amazing steak and vegetables on the side that were delicious. What is you favorite food? \n\nMEMORY:\n1.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains fragmented information that does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While some elements such as the mention of Brazilian steak could loosely relate to the context of eating Brazilian foods, it lacks specific and direct connection to the current dialogue about the Black Widow movie or the immediate context surrounding the foods they ate. Additionally, most sentences in the MEMORY focus on activities and preferences that are unmentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as salsa dancing and healing methods, which do not help in generating a response that feels seamless or relevant to the conversation they are having. The MEMORY provides very limited support for any causality or development of the interaction between the speakers."
