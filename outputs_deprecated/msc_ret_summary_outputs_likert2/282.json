Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar. Speaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n2. Speaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition.\n3. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n4. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n5. Speaker A is eating their favorite jello.\n6. Speaker B also enjoys jello, with cherry being their favorite flavor as well.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Lay off desserts in general. I've been indulging a bit too much lately and need to cut back on the sugar intake.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about the connection both speakers have to jello and family traditions, which could be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the information is mostly about Speaker A's experiences and preferences related to jello, which do not directly contribute to generating a response to the specific question Speaker A asks in the dialogueâ€”whether Speaker B needs to lay off jello or desserts in general due to weight concerns. The MEMORY lacks information about Speaker B's perspective on this issue, making it less helpful in formulating an appropriate next response. The individual memories do not seem to build naturally or demonstrate causality related to Speaker B's weight concerns or decision to lay off on the sugar, resulting in a lower score."
