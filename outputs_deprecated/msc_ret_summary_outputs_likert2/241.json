Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming? Speaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates.\n2. Speaker A enjoys reading books about ice cream, Disney World, and computers.\n3. Speaker A works for a small local business with a demanding schedule.\n4. Speaker A is considering a career in dentistry but is also interested in working at Disney for happiness.\n5. Speaker A considers quitting their job to work at Disney World.\n6. Speaker A is torn between choosing a career in dentistry for the money or working at Disney for happiness.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains multiple points about Speaker A that do not directly contribute to generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While there is some relevant background information such as Speaker A's interests in computers, which could potentially relate to Speaker B's job, the connection is not clear or directly useful for moving the current conversation forward. Furthermore, mentions of Speaker A's career considerations (dentistry or Disney World) do not have an evident link to the ongoing discussion about Speaker B's job at a computer company. The information about Speaker B not being able to change careers may be slightly related, but it's not elaborated on in the MEMORY, hence it doesn't offer significant relevance or causality in this context. Overall, MEMORY lacks the clear connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT needed to provide substantial helpfulness."
