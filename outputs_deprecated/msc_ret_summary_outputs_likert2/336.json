Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n2. Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys watching movies with them.\n3. Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.\n4. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n5. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n6. Speaker A suggests taking naps during quiet times and mentions watching her grandkids.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, it was a great escape. I love getting lost in a good book, especially after keeping up with my energetic grandchildren all day.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as it contains multiple references to Speaker A having grandchildren, which connects with the context of taking a break from watching them. However, the MEMORY does not provide detailed information on the book-related aspects or whether Speaker A typically finds reading or movies exciting, which would be more directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences are somewhat repetitive and do not strongly demonstrate causality or development of interactions, although they are consistently related to the topic of grandchildren. Overall, the MEMORY aids in setting the context but lacks diversity and depth in contributions towards potential dialogue directions."
