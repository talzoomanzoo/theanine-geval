Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n2. Speaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks.\n3. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n4. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities.\n5. Speaker A is nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes.\n6. Speaker A leads hikes for the group they camp with, which are usually an hour or two long.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great that you're getting your friends out on the trails with you! It's always nice to share the experience with others, even if they do get tired quickly.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a substantial amount of helpful information for generating a response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reveals that Speaker A enjoys hiking and camping and leads hikes for friends, which aligns with the conversation where Speaker A mentions leading friends on a local trail. The MEMORY also indicates an upcoming challenge for Speaker A as they are nervous about an extensive part of the Appalachian Trail hike, suggesting relevant conversation topics or potential advice or encouragement Speaker B could offer. Moreover, Speaker B recently enjoyed a long hike, which is a detail that could be connected to Speaker B's current conversational interest. However, some sentences, like those about camping more generally, may not be directly relevant to this specific dialogue. The provided information is connected and pertinent, although not all details directly aid in the immediate interaction."
