Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n4. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n5. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n6. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I completely understand the stress of making such a big decision. Teaching definitely sounds like a solid choice for you, especially with your passion for linguistics. Just keep exploring your options and follow your heart.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several relevant pieces of information that could assist in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it notes Speaker B's consideration of pursuing a master's degree and potentially becoming a college professor, which aligns well with the current discussion about career options and teaching. The memory that Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to find a practical job in that field further supports this context. Additionally, Speaker B's feeling of being limited in job opportunities ties into the stress discussed in the dialogue. Speaker A's interest in teaching and their current occupation while studying could offer angles for further discussion, such as comparing teaching in different fields. Overall, the MEMORY provides helpful background information about both speakers' educational and career goals, contributing to a coherent and informed continuation of the dialogue."
