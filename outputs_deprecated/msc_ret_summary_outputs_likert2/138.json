Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting! Speaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow? Speaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from. Speaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same. Speaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal. Speaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab! Speaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor? Speaker B: Yes, more ice cream is always good, haha! I like a good rocky road, or pretty much any chocolate ice cream with nuts or stir-ins! I like most of Jeni's brand too. How about you? What is your favorite kind? Speaker A: I am a big fan of cookie dough ice cream, and I love cheesecake flavored ice creams too! Ben & Jerry has some that I like, but I prefer to get ice cream from an ice cream shop.  It's just something about being in that environment,\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n2. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n4. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n5. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n6. Speaker A had cheesy ham and potato soup for dinner.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some potentially relevant information, such as Speaker B working at a research lab, which connects to the context of cloning discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, many of the other memory sentences are not directly relevant or beneficial for generating a response to the current conversation context. For instance, details about food preferences and past meals are not directly connected to the ongoing topic of cloned animals and plant-based products. Additionally, the information about Speaker A and Speaker B being in different fields of work could be useful, but it is not detailed enough to provide clear causality or development in their interactions. Overall, while there are hints of relevant information, the MEMORY lacks cohesive and directly helpful content that would aid in crafting a response in the dialogue."
