Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is good at ice skating and suggests going to an ice skating rink during winter break.\n2. Speaker A's sons play video games and listen to music in their rooms.\n3. Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away.\n4. Speaker A is a family man who loves spending time with his sons.\n5. Speaker B has two sons, one who loves Chinese food like Speaker A, and the other who prefers Italian food.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both have two sons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful for generating a response. Specifically, sentence 1 about Speaker B's skill and interest in ice skating is directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and can be used to create a natural conversational continuation about ice skating. Sentence 2 and 4 give background on Speaker A and his sons which might be slightly relevant, though not directly related to ice skating. Sentence 5, while offering some insight into Speaker B's family preferences, doesn't add much to the current context. Overall, the MEMORY contains a few potentially useful pieces of information but lacks strong interconnectedness or clear causality relevant to the dialogue about ice skating preferences."
