Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n3. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n4. Speaker A enjoys playing soccer but is not into music.\n5. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n6. Speaker A is a college student majoring in Humanities, not currently employed but used to work part-time at a supermarket.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as it specifies that Speaker B played intramural soccer in college, which directly relates to the question asked. However, there's a lack of clear causality or connection between the sentences. The other details about Speaker A's soccer playing are informative but not directly linked to generating a response for the current question about Speaker B's position. Additionally, the information about Speaker A's major and employment history is less relevant to the topic of soccer."
