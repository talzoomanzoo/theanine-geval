Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?

    "raw_prediction": "I love visiting the San Diego Zoo. It's a great place to spend the day and see all kinds of animals.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some elements that could be helpful, such as Speaker A's interest in visiting the zoo and Speaker B's connection to family and a child who wants to visit the zoo. However, the information is mostly not directly relevant or naturally connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, the memory about Speaker A enjoying zoos and Speaker B being a parent and looking for family discounts could provide some context, but the specific details about Speaker A suggesting taking pets to the zoo or Speaker B pushing for a school field trip do not align with the conversation happening in the context. Thus, the MEMORY lacks the clear relevance and natural structure needed to significantly aid in generating a response in DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
