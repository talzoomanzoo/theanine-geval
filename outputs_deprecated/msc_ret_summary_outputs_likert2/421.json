Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone?  Speaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\n2. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety.\n3. Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\n4. Speaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding.\n5. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n6. Speaker A is a runner who is working on improving their mile time and training for a marathon.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fantastic to hear! Your passion for motivating others really shines through. I think your energy and positivity would be perfect for helping my friend get back into running. Let's make a plan and get them back on track together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for a language model to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY highlights key characteristics and experiences of Speaker B, such as their role as a motivational speaker and their personal struggle with depression and anxiety, which adds depth to the context provided in the dialogue. This enhances understanding of Speaker B's motivation and credibility as a motivational speaker. The MEMORY also references Speaker B's past experience as a runner and their connection with Speaker A through a shared interest in marathoning, which is directly relevant to the topic of conversation in the dialogue. The memory is well-structured, presenting information in a logical order that connects past interactions and motivations of both speakers, aiding in generating a cohesive response. However, it could rate a 5 if there was slightly more detail or specific causality/relevancy demonstrated clearly connecting events between the two speakers in line with the dialogue."
