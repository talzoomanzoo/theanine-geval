Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me. Speaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n2. Speaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks.\n3. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy being outdoors, but Speaker B prefers the fresh air over being in the mud and rain.\n5. Speaker A is nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes.\n6. Speaker B dislikes bugs and is not a fan of camping, hiking, or the outdoors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "They did! Even though they were tired, they really enjoyed the fresh air and the beautiful scenery. It was a fun day out for all of us.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides mixed relevance in terms of helpfulness for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. There are several points that are somewhat pertinent:\n- Sentence 2 and 3 highlight Speaker A's enjoyment of hiking, which lines up with Speaker A leading friends on a hike.\n- Sentence 4 provides a contradiction to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, indicating that Speaker B enjoys being outdoors and prefers fresh air, while the context suggests Speaker B is not a fan of the outdoors.\n- Sentence 6 is relevant because it matches Speaker B's aversion to the outdoors from the context.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides some relevant details that align with the context, but there are inconsistencies, such as Sentence 1 and Sentence 4, that detract from its overall coherence and usefulness. Sentences are not entirely connected, lacking clear causality or relevance in some instances. A score of 3 reflects this partial helpfulness."
