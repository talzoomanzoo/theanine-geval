Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden. Speaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways? Speaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there? Speaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot.  Speaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden? Speaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends. Speaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going? Speaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discussed the differences between Sweden and the US, including coffee breaks.\n4. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n5. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n6. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it mentions that Speaker A's cousin is in Sweden, which aligns with the dialogue where Speaker A mentions their cousin's assistance in planning the trip. However, some details in the MEMORY, like Speaker A and B planning to travel together or discussing coffee breaks in Sweden, aren't directly relevant to the current dialogue and don't clearly indicate a causality or relevancy to the present conversation. The connection between the dialogues and memories could be stronger for a higher rating. Overall, the memory provides some helpful context but lacks a fully coherent narrative that would make the dialogue generation more informed."
