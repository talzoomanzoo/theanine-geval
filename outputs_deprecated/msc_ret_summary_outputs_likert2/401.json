Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad. Speaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs! Speaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is looking to redecorate their house and likes purple furniture.\n2. Speaker B regrets their green and purple color scheme and is willing to give away their purple furniture.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices.\n4. Speaker B is considering adding more colorful elements to the room to make the purple sofas work.\n5. Speaker A suggests ways to incorporate the purple sofas into the existing light green paint in the room.\n6. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about the home decor discussion between Speaker A and Speaker B, which ties into the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they are discussing color schemes and furniture. However, it doesn't completely align with the current context since there's no mention of playing guitar, bug spray, or patio furniture which are key parts of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY does provide a foundation about their ongoing considerations with colors and furniture choices, indicating some past interactions but lacks continuity and specific connection regarding the topics in the current dialogue, like the patio furniture query."
