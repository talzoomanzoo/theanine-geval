Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha! Speaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes? Speaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe.  Speaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm?  Speaker B: I'll be living off campus, so absolutely. How about you? Are you staying in the dorms? Speaker A: I'm glad your taking them with you. My mum wants me to stay in dorms. But I think I just want my own place, less drama and more freedom that way.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n3. Speaker B is excited about taking neuroscience classes next year.\n4. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n5. Speaker A does not have any pets and expresses an interest in scuba diving.\n6. Speaker B goes to Hawaii for scuba diving and is considering studying marine life or a different type of animal.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Living off campus definitely has its perks. Having your own space can really make a difference in your college experience. Plus, you'll have the freedom to come and go as you please without any restrictions. It sounds like a good choice for you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for Speaker B to generate a proper response. For example, point 1 refers to Speaker B's pet snakes, Hansel and Gretel, which are mentioned in the dialogue context, supporting the ongoing conversation about Speaker B's pets. Additionally, point 4 shows Speaker A's view on animals versus humans, which could inform the tone or direction of future dialogue about animals or pets. However, many details in the MEMORY, such as Speaker B's interest in studying neuroscience (point 3), Speaker A's interest in scuba diving (point 5), and Speaker B's potential interest in marine life (point 6), are not directly related to the current dialogue and do not assist in generating the next immediate response. Furthermore, some statements are not causally connected (e.g., Speaker A's volunteering activity in point 2), which makes the MEMORY less cohesive when considering the context of the dialogue."
