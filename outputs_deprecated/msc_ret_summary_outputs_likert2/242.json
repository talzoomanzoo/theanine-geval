Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming? Speaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both. Speaker A: That sounds interesting. That's great that you love your job, not many people do.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys reading books about ice cream, Disney World, and computers.\n2. Speaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates.\n3. Speaker A works for a small local business with a demanding schedule.\n4. Speaker A is considering a career in dentistry but is also interested in working at Disney for happiness.\n5. Speaker B's mother is a dentist and loves her job.\n6. Speaker A considers quitting their job to work at Disney World.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant context about Speaker B's job at a computer company and the limitations regarding changing careers, as well as Speaker A's varied career interests, which could influence the conversation. However, while the pieces of information are connected to past discussions (careers and jobs), they don't all directly pertain to troubleshooting between hardware and software. The causality and connection between the events are somewhat scattered, making it less helpful for generating the next response. More direct links between Speaker B's troubleshooting work and the current dialogue context would elevate the score."
