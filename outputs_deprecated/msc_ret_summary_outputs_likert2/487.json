Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. Speaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is an artist who walks through nature for work.\n2. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n3. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n4. Speaker A asks about Speaker B's new artwork and acknowledges their need for inspiration.\n5. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks.\n6. Speaker A enjoys reading sci-fi and mysteries, while Speaker B prefers fantasy books.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information that is relevant and adds depth to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker B is an artist who finds inspiration during nature walks, which directly relates to Speaker A's mention of a nature walk that B might like. The connection to Speaker B's profession and lifestyle (living in the country, working with animals, enjoyment of nature) further explains why B would be interested. Speaker A's context as a city dweller adds contrast but is informative for understanding the speakers' dynamics. The mention of Speaker B's reading preferences indirectly supports their love of fantasy and nature, thus bolstering their interest in nature walks. Overall, MEMORY helps clarify and enrich the conversation by establishing connections and understanding speakers' personas, but some sentences (e.g., about specific book series) are less directly useful."
