Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?   Speaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere! Speaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it. Speaker A: I don't have recipes but I know how to make a good grilled asparagus. Are you looking to bolster your chef book? Speaker B: I sure am!  Grilled asparagus does sound good.  Do you pair the grilled asparagus with your fajitas?  What do you prefer, chicken or beef fajitas? Speaker A: I prefer chicken to beef. I pair it with beef fajitas andI think it's great to have with a glass of merlot. Do you like wine?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys grilling indoors and suggests grilled asparagus with lemon on it.\n2. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters.\n3. Speaker B is interested in trying different careers and is considering becoming a chef for Speaker A who loves Mexican food and seafood.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines.\n5. Speaker A loves animals, especially puppies, and visits shelters in every city they go to.\n6. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I do enjoy wine! Merlot sounds like the perfect pairing for grilled asparagus and beef fajitas. I'll have to try that combination sometime.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that can support the continuation of the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it mentions that Speaker A enjoys grilling asparagus (#1), which is directly relevant to the current topic of asparagus recipes. Additionally, it provides context about Speaker A's preferences and activities involving puppies and shelters (#5, #6), which aligns with part of the conversation regarding puppies and animals. However, some MEMORY sentences, such as Speaker B considering a chef career (#3) or plans to travel the world (#4), lack direct relevance to the immediate conversation topics, making them less helpful. The natural connection and causality between few MEMORY sentences and the context weaken the overall helpfulness score."
