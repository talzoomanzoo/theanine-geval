Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships! Speaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field? Speaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate? Speaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n2. Speaker B is looking for internships in the sports medicine field and has asked professors for letters of recommendation.\n3. Speaker B is interested in sports medicine and enjoys surfing.\n4.

    "raw_prediction": "It's great that you have a clear plan for your last year. As for my knees, years of hiking and collecting shells along the coast took a toll on them. But it's all worth it for the memories and the joy it brought me. Just be careful with your own physical activities, especially with soccer and surfing. Your health is important too.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information that relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The information about Speaker B searching for internships in sports medicine, their interest in sports medicine, and the mention of needing letters of recommendation are all pertinent to the current conversation. Moreover, Speaker A's background in the medical field and how they are offering advice fit well with the context of providing internship information.\n\nHowever, while the MEMORY provides relevant pieces of information, the connections between these pieces could be more explicit. For example, the suggestion about surfing as a way to make connections in the medical field could have been connected to Speaker B's interest in surfing, if it had been mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions Speaker A enjoying hiking and collecting shells, which, while helpful in painting a broader picture of Speaker A, is less directly connected to the ongoing conversation specifically about internships and careers.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is greatly helpful, but improving the clarity of connections and relevance to the immediate conversation would help to achieve a perfect score."
