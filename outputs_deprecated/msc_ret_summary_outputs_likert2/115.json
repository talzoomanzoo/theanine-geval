Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position.  Speaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it? Speaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days.  Speaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living. Speaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime? Speaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play. Speaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n3. Speaker A enjoys playing soccer but is not into music.\n4. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n5. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n6. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Sounds like a plan! I'll let you know when we have a game scheduled. Casual games can be just as fun and a great way to get back into it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides a reasonable amount of relevant information that can help Speaker A generate a proper response. Many of the sentences, especially 1, 2, and 4, help understand Speaker A's soccer background and enthusiasm, which is pertinent considering the context involves a discussion about playing soccer together. Sentence 5 also naturally aligns with the dialogue context by highlighting Speaker Bâ€™s past experience in college soccer, directly connecting to the ongoing conversation. Sentence 6 adds additional context about sports preferences, which might be helpful but not essential in this specific scenario. The mention in sentence 3 about Speaker A's disinterest in music seems less relevant to the current dialogue context. Overall, the information about soccer is well connected and causally relevant, leading to a high helpfulness score."
