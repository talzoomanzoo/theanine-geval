Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there? Speaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay? Speaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately? Speaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"' Speaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history. Speaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing?  Speaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\n3. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n4. Speaker B has an oldest nephew who is about to turn 14.\n5. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n6. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Haha, sounds like your nephew is ready to make a bold statement! At least it will be a memorable 14th birthday for him. Have you decided on any Easter weekend plans yet?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided has some relevant pieces of information but is mostly disconnected from the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. A couple of entries could have been more directly helpful if they aligned more with the specific topic being discussed in the context, such as Speaker B's upcoming trip to Costa Rica, the nephew's activities, or the book \"The Gettysburg Campaign.\" However, the MEMORY lacks these connections and details, such as Speaker B's excitement about Easter weekend and lack of packing, which are irrelevant to the present focus. Additionally, points about humorous style and nephewâ€™s age aren't critical at this stage. Overall, the memories lack significant helpfulness according to the criterion that expects detailed and naturally connected information."
