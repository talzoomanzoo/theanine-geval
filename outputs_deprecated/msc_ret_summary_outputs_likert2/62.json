Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The connection between Speaker A's enjoyment of the zoo, and their interest in a tiger named Joshua, aligns well with Speaker B's question about seeing Joshua. Also, the MEMORY highlights Speaker B's role as a parent and their advocacy for their daughter's interest, which could be useful for generating responses related to family activities or zoos. Most of the MEMORY's components are relevant and enhance understanding of both speakers, making it connected and useful for the ongoing dialogue. However, some details such as visiting the zoo on a weekly basis were not directly relevant to the current context, preventing a perfect score."
