Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me? Speaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week? Speaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B found flights that work for their schedule and price and will be visiting Speaker A in a couple of weeks.\n2. Speaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights.\n3. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\n4. Speaker A has visited Alaska and describes it as beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage.\n5. Speaker A mentioned the warm weather at their location.\n6. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds amazing! I can't wait to experience that warm weather when I visit in a couple of weeks.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as it highlights important details about Speaker A's invitation to Speaker B, Speaker B's consideration of flights, and plans for the visit. Sentences 1, 2, 3, and 6 in the MEMORY are directly relevant, as they discuss the invitation, planning, and activities anticipated during the visit, all of which are naturally linked to the current dialogue about flight prices and visiting plans. Sentence 5, about the weather, supports the conversation on the weather, adding context. Sentence 4, about Alaska, appears less connected with the present topic and is slightly less relevant than the others. Overall, the memory aids in guiding Speaker B to generate an appropriate response in the ongoing exchange."
