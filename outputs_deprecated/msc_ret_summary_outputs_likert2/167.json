Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me. Speaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway? Speaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n2. Speaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks.\n3. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities.\n4. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n5. Speaker A leads hikes for the group they camp with, which are usually an hour or two long.\n6. Speaker A is nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a fun and well-prepared hike! I might consider joining you guys one day, especially if there's tasty trail mix involved.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant background information about Speaker A, which could assist Speaker B in generating a meaningful response. The information about Speaker B going on a long hike and enjoying it is somewhat contradictory to the dialogue where Speaker B mentions not being a fan of the outdoors, which could be confusing. However, the rest of the MEMORY offers insights into Speaker A's interests and activities related to hiking and camping, providing a useful context for discussing hiking plans or experiences. While there is some relevance, the connection between past interactions and current dialogue context is not perfectly clear or cohesive, which affects the score. Overall, the MEMORY is moderately helpful."
