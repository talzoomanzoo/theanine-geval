Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok?  Speaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish? Speaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n2. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n3. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n4. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n5. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n6. Speaker A is an omnivore.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds amazing! Chicken parmesan is one of my favorites too. I bet it tastes even better because it's free. Can't wait to see the pic!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It confirms that Speaker A works at a restaurant and enjoys their work, which adds context to their excitement about trying a new dish from the menu. The fact that Speaker A gets free meals ties into their anticipation of tasting the Chicken parmesan. However, the information about Speaker B loving the beach and Mediterranean food, while interesting, is not directly relevant to the current dialogue topic and does not clearly demonstrate causality or relevancy to the ongoing conversation about the new menu item. Therefore, the MEMORY is helpful but not perfectly aligned to the specific context."
