Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think? Speaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons Speaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use. Speaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n2. Speaker A's favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, saying \"for you I shall live\".\n3. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n4. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n5. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B have a conversation about their personal interests and trips they have taken for work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "They can be a bit painful, but the end result is worth it for me. Maybe you could start with a small tattoo in a less sensitive area to see how you handle it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful context for generating a next response from Speaker A regarding getting a new tattoo. It includes relevant information such as Speaker A's enjoyment of getting tattoos and their plans for a meaningful tattoo. This ties into the context of honoring Speaker A's parents, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT of considering a new tattoo for their mom. The detail about having a tattoo in memory of their late father is particularly pertinent and naturally connects to the ongoing dialogue. The mention of working at a coffee shop is not directly related to the conversation about tattoos, but it does give some background that could be useful for building rapport or for future conversational threads about personal life. Overall, the MEMORY enhances the potential for a relatable and contextually aware response. However, there are some elements in the MEMORY that could be refined to be more directly aligned with the current dialogue."
