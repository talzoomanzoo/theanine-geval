Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods. Speaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about? Speaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America.

Speaker A enjoys salsa dancing and is planning to go out dancing.\n4. Speaker B works as a bartender and enjoys meeting different people.\n5.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information, like Speaker A's interest in Brazilian food and their plans for salsa dancing, which slightly aligns with the Dialogue Context's reference to Brazilian foods. However, the MEMORY does not directly contribute to generating a proper next response in the context of discussing Marvel movies or provide a clear causal or relevant connection to the ongoing conversation about the Black Widow movie. Most of the MEMORY is unrelated to the topic and does not assist in advancing the dialogue about movies, which limits its helpfulness."
