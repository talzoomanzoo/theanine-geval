Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar. Speaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general? Speaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts. Speaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts? Speaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.  Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition.\n2. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n3. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n4. Speaker B does not do a lot of cooking or baking but is interested in learning.\n5. Speaker B is excited to join Speaker A's family for a water skiing trip and wants to learn from Speaker A's kids.\n6. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides limited helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes details about Speaker A's connection to jello through family tradition, which somewhat ties in with the conversation about jello and teaching kids cooking. However, most of the MEMORY content is about Speaker A's personal memories and experiences with jello, which does not directly relate to the current conversation topics like learning to bake, sugar intake, or skiing. There's little causality or development from past interactions that can guide Speaker A's next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Only a few sentences in the MEMORY may somewhat inform a response, but overall, it lacks direct relevance and connectivity to the current topics."
