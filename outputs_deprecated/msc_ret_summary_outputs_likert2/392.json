Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast. Speaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project. Speaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery.

And one of the companies I work for had their system hit with a virus so I've been upgraded their software to debug the system. Speaker A: I teach group classes and one on one, but I was the student today. I specialize in jiu-jitsu but today I got to be the student in a taekwondo class.  Speaker B: That's even better, learning is a life-long journey. How are you class on martial art history? When you have time teach me too, I'd love to learn. \n\nMEMORY:\n1.

    "raw_prediction": "My class on martial arts history is going great! I'm learning so much about the origins and evolution of different styles. I'd be happy to teach you some interesting facts and stories, just let me know when you're ready to dive in!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides quite a bit of relevant information that could aid Speaker A in generating a natural and contextually appropriate next response. It mentions Speaker A's involvement in the martial arts, their active lifestyle, and their pursuit of an athletic training degree, which ties into the context of their current martial arts class. It also highlights both speakers' mutual interest in martial arts, which ties back to Speaker B's interest in learning martial art history from Speaker A. A slight improvement could be made in terms of clarity and connection in relating how both speakers first showed interest in martial arts history. However, the MEMORY is mostly helpful and relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
