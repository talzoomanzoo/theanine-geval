Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? Speaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month Speaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation? Speaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there! Speaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n2. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds.\n3. Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they go to the zoo every few weeks.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo.\n5. Speaker A enjoys seeing pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister.\n6. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for Speaker B to generate a response in this context. The points about Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo (MEMORY 1 and 4) and considering adopting a kitten from a friend (MEMORY 6) are directly relevant to the conversation topics in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Speaker B discusses going to San Diego and potentially adopting one of Speaker A's friend’s kittens. Additionally, MEMORY 3 mentions Speaker B's girlfriend enjoying pandas and penguins, which could be relevant in discussing zoo visits, aligning with the conversation's current trajectory about plans and interests related to the zoo.\n\nHowever, some sentences (like MEMORY 2, 3, and 5 about Speaker A's experiences) either don't directly relate to the current context or don't offer a natural sequential connection to what Speaker A has been discussing. So, while there is helpful information, it doesn’t have a clear causal or narrative flow connecting past interactions with the current one to fully merit a higher score."
