Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n2. Speaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\n3. Speaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\n4. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n5. Speaker B's new car is black, and it is their first new car after driving pre-owned cars before.\n6. Speaker A is older and mentions having blue hair already.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY does contain some information that could help generate a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, point 1 indicates that Speaker B has not started packing yet for their trip, which might relate to whether they have purchased the plane tickets. Points 3 and 5 also suggest that Speaker B plans to drive during spring break with their new black car, offering context to Speaker B's travel plans. However, the other points do not directly connect to the question of plane tickets, and the MEMORY overall lacks a clear and cohesive narrative. The connections between the statements are weak and do not directly address the specific question posed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This results in a MEMORY that provides some relevant information but not in a naturally connected or helpful way that demonstrates clear relevancy to the question at hand."
