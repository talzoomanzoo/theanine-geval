Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. Speaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price? Speaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note.\n2. Speaker B believes that luxurious items distract from the value of their family.\n3. Speaker A enjoys the peace and quiet of country life, the fresh produce, and fresh air.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n5. Speaker B appreciates the convenience of city living but also values what the country has to offer.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains various snippets of information about previous interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B. However, most of these points do not directly relate to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT or offer helpful information for generating a relevant response. The context involves Speaker A's recent purchase of an iPhone and their enjoyment of music apps. None of the MEMORY points specifically address Speaker B's potential responses or attitudes towards technology, music, or recent purchases. Additionally, while there are some mentions of shared activities like buying lotto tickets, these are not directly tied to the conversation about the iPhone purchase. The memory lacks sentences that accurately represent the development of their dialogue, such as Speaker B's likely opinions or causal reactions connected to the purchase of a luxury item like an iPhone. Thus, the MEMORY is not very helpful for continuing the dialogue in a natural or connected manner."
