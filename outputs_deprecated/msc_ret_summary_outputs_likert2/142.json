Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A's pet raccoon enjoys eating pizza.\n2. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for music and plan to have a house concert with their pets.\n4. Speaker B enjoys going on cruises for fun.\n5. Speaker A's friend found two baby raccoons in her yard, one of which was given to Speaker A to keep as a pet.\n6. Speaker A is not interested in going on a cruise and would prefer camping as a vacation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it mentions that Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey (Memory 2), which aligns with the context where Journey ate a piece of pizza. Memory 1 further expands on Journey's behavior by indicating that she enjoys eating pizza, connecting nicely to the context in which Journey ate a slice. This memory helps the language model generate a more informed and contextually appropriate response about Journey's eating habits. However, while Memory 1 and 2 are highly relevant, other information pieces (e.g., shared love of music, preferences for cruising or camping) do not directly contribute to the dialogue about preventing Journey from getting into food. Despite this, the naturally connected structures and relevant content earn a high score, although not perfect."
