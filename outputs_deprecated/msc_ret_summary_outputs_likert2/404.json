Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad. Speaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs! Speaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours? Speaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock?  Speaker B: I guess I was going to get like an umbrella table and some chairs to go with it or maybe even a screened in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle. Speaker A: That's a great idea! Sounds like a very nice place for a barbeque. What were you planning on grilling for the barbeque? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n2. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange.\n5. Speaker A recently bought new furniture for their house, including a couch, recliner, and patio furniture.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy barbecuing and have a love for pets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I was thinking of grilling some burgers, hot dogs, and maybe some veggie skewers for those who don't eat meat. What do you think?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that could aid in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Points 1, 2, and 6 highlight Speaker A's interest in barbecuing, which aligns with the ongoing discussion about the barbecue in the dialogue context. Moreover, the mentions of furniture and home decor in points 3, 4, and 5 connect with the current conversation about patio furniture and decorating ideas. However, point 4's specific mention of a \"furniture exchange\" might not be entirely consistent with the current dialogue context, where no such exchange is mentioned. Nonetheless, the connections and relevance are generally clear, making the memory helpful enough to warrant a strong score."
