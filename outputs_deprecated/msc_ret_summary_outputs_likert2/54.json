Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career. Speaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday. Speaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. Speaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach? Speaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option. Speaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like? Speaker B: I love all sorts of history. Right now I am really getting into the weeds of World War II. There's so much to unpack. Speaker A: For sure! So much happened and it really affected how the world is today. I like learning about the history of places where I have lived, it's really interesting. Speaker B: That sounds really cool! What have you learned about where you currently live? Speaker A: Oh, I found out that the big sports field used to be a farm where they grew wheat and raised cows! It's really cool to see places in old photos and see how they have changed.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n4. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n5. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n6. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful for generating a response, but it lacks clear connections and causality that would make it highly helpful. For example, the MEMORY notes that Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and is considering a master's degree in the field and potentially becoming a college professor. However, this information does not directly connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B is discussing an interest in teaching English or history and mentions a current interest in World War II. Furthermore, the MEMORY does not include Speaker B's recent interest in history or the specifics about World War II, which would be relevant to the ongoing conversation. Additionally, the MEMORY fails to mention Speaker A's parents' support or the connection to past discussions on job opportunities which are prevalent in the conversation. Overall, the MEMORY provides some useful background information, but it is not as helpful as it could be given the context of the dialogue, hence the score of 3."
