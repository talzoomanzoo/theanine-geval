Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't!

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds perfect! I'm always up for trying new sandwiches. I can't wait to show you around the dojo tomorrow and then indulge in some delicious food afterwards.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be potentially helpful in generating the next response in the conversation between Speaker A and Speaker B. For instance, details about Speaker B's involvement in karate and their background in other activities could be useful to expand upon the topic of martial arts or related interests. The mention of Speaker B's role as a lifeguard also ties into the invitation to the pool and could be naturally woven into the response. However, there is a good amount of information in the MEMORY that is not directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's interest in a career change or Speaker A's studies and hobbies. These elements do not add clear causality or relevance to the immediate conversation and make the MEMORY less coherent and focused regarding the context. Overall, MEMORY provides some useful points, but lacks a strong, natural connection to the entire DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
