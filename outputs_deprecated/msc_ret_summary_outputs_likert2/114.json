Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position.  Speaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it? Speaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days.  Speaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living. Speaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime? Speaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n3. Speaker A enjoys playing soccer but is not into music.\n4. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n5. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n6. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful background information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the fact that Speaker A is actively involved in soccer and enjoys playing as a striker, which aligns with their interest in being a voice on a soccer video game. Additionally, knowing that Speaker B played college soccer and is a fan of a soccer team (Manchester United) is relevant to their interest in getting back into playing for exercise. However, there are several pieces of information that are not directly relevant to the CONTEXT, such as Speaker A's disinterest in music, and some facts about their fandoms, which might not aid in generating the next response. Furthermore, while the causal and relevant connections between the sentences within MEMORY are more or less clear, they could be organized or linked in a way that adds to their natural flow and helpfulness."
