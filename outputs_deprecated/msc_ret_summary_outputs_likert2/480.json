Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?   Speaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere! Speaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it. Speaker A: I don't have recipes but I know how to make a good grilled asparagus. Are you looking to bolster your chef book? Speaker B: I sure am!  Grilled asparagus does sound good.  Do you pair the grilled asparagus with your fajitas?  What do you prefer, chicken or beef fajitas?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters.\n2. Speaker A enjoys grilling indoors and suggests grilled asparagus with lemon on it.\n3. Speaker B is interested in trying different careers and is considering becoming a chef for Speaker A who loves Mexican food and seafood.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines.\n5. Speaker A loves animals, especially puppies, and visits shelters in every city they go to.\n6. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I usually pair the grilled asparagus with lemon and a bit of olive oil, it adds a nice touch to the dish. And for fajitas, I prefer chicken fajitas over beef, but both are delicious!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of information that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and naturally connected, demonstrating the interests and preferences of both speakers. It includes Speaker A's enjoyment of cooking and specific mention of grilling, which directly ties into the discussion about recipes and grilled asparagus. There is also a clear connection between Speaker A's love for animals and their experiences at animal shelters, which aligns with the context of discussing puppies and a new cat at the shelter. Speaker A's preference for puppies over kittens is supported by their love for animals, especially puppies, as mentioned in MEMORY. However, some points in MEMORY, such as Speaker B considering a career change to become a chef for Speaker A, seem less directly relevant to the current context but still relate to the overarching connection both speakers have with food and cooking. Overall, the MEMORY is helpful as it enhances the background and motivations of the speakers, assisting in generating more informed responses."
