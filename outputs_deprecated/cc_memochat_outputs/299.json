    "raw_prediction": "It's great that you're proactive about clarifying boundaries. One additional step we could take is to maybe document our agreement in writing to avoid any future misunderstandings. What do you think?",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The current dialogue focuses on marking a boundary line between properties to avoid future misunderstandings. The memory, however, pertains to a past conversation about feeling overwhelmed and seeking support, which is unrelated to the current discussion about property boundaries. Thus, the past information does not provide valuable context for generating a response in this conversation.\n\nJudgement: No"
