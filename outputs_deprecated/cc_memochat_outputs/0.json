    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context is centered on the importance of being a good listener. The memory contains information about the parent's journey towards independence and learning to ask for help. However, it does not contain direct or related information about listening skills. Thus, the memory is not relevant to the dialogue context.\nJudgement: \"No\""
