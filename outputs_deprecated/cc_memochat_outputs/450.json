    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves one person wanting to talk to another about something, but details about the topic of conversation are not specified. The MEMORY includes prior dialogues about trust issues between classmates, which could be relevant if the upcoming conversation involves trust. However, without additional context that directly points to trust, it's impossible to determine if the MEMORY is needed. Therefore, this situation doesn't specifically call for the use of past information.\nJudgement: N/A"
