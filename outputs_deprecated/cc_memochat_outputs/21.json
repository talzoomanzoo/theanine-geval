    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about a playful interaction turning into a disagreement, with no indication of needing past plans or desires such as hanging out more or planning a movie night. The MEMORY contains unrelated information regarding spending more time together or planning activities. The context does not imply that the past information is needed to respond effectively. \n\nJudgement: No"
