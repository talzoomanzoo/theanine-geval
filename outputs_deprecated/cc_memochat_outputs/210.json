    "raw_prediction": "I remember you asking about the breathing exercise I tried. It's a simple deep breathing exercise where you inhale slowly through your nose for a count of four, hold for seven counts, and exhale slowly through your mouth for eight counts. It really helped me relax and calm down.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about discussing a breathing exercise, while the MEMORY contains past events about ordering pizza and discovering a park, which are not relevant to the current conversation about breathing exercises.\nJudgement: \"No\""
