I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\nThat's awesome! I didn't know you sang.\nYeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while.\nWell, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing?\nI sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites.\nThat's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice.\nThank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it.\nI'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent.\nThanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it.\nDefinitely. It's great to have a hobby like that. Reminds me of when you uncovered that mystery a while back. You always seem to surprise us with your skills.\nHaha, yeah. I do like a good challenge. Speaking of surprises, remember when I found out you were married? That was a shocker.\nOh gosh, yes. I forget sometimes that not everyone knows. But yeah, I've been married for a few years now.\nCrazy how time flies. Like when we found out Ms. Singh was leaving our school. I still can't believe that was two years ago.\nI know, right? She was such a great teacher. Speaking of which, have you heard anything about her lately?\nNot really. I think she moved to another state, but I'm not sure where.\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Ms. Singh Leaving', 'Related Summaries': 'Co-workers A and B discuss the news of Ms. Singh leaving the school.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Co-workers A: Hey, did you hear the news about Ms. Singh? ### Co-workers B: No, what about her? ### Co-workers A: She's leaving the school at the end of the year. ### Co-workers B: Oh wow, that's a shame.
