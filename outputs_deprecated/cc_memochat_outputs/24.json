    "raw_prediction": "I understand that you are trying to apologize and move on from the situation. It's important to acknowledge when we have upset someone and work towards resolving any misunderstandings. Showing empathy and understanding can help rebuild the relationship.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT primarily involves a discussion about a recent incident where Neighbor A pushed Neighbor B into cold water. The MEMORY contains information about past interactions focusing on spending time together and planning a movie night, which is unrelated to the incident in the current conversation. This past information about hanging out more often does not provide context or relevance to the current apology and argument about the water incident. Thus, MEMORY does not contain helpful information for the language model to generate a proper next response in this case.\n\nJudgement: No"
