    "raw_prediction": "It seems like you're feeling unsettled about the fact that Classmates B knows something about you that even your closest friends don't. Remember, everyone has their own ways of finding out information. If it's nothing harmful or embarrassing, perhaps you can approach Classmates B to have an open and honest conversation about it to ease your concerns.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves a person (Classmates A) who is curious about what Classmates B knows about their past, which even their closest friends do not know. The MEMORY includes an unrelated topic about an encounter with a mysterious woman in a dark alley, which does not contain any relevant information about Classmates A's past or help explain how Classmates B came to know something about it.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
