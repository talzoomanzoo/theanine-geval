    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about Neighbors A being excited about finding a buyer for a product and Neighbors B asking for more details about the product. MEMORY contains dialogues about support and missing pets, which seem unrelated to the context about a product. This context does not require the memory of supportive chats or incidents unrelated to the product sales. \nJudgement: No"
