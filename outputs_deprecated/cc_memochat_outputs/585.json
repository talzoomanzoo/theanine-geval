Remember, it's normal to feel stuck sometimes, and it doesn't mean you're not a good writer. Just keep at it, and the creativity will come back to you.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY provided revolves around a past experience of the husband feeling nervous during a presentation and being reassured by his wife. This does not directly relate to his current problem of feeling stuck with writing and seeking new ideas. The past experience in MEMORY does not offer specific information or solution that would help the dialogue context about the current writing struggle.\nJudgement: No"
