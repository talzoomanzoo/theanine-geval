It's something I'm not proud of, but it's a part of my past that I can't change. ### Mentor: Of course, Mentee. I'm here to listen and support you. Could you tell me more about your experience with substance abuse? ### Mentee: Sure. I started drinking when I was 15, and it quickly became a habit. It was a way to escape from my problems and feel better about myself. But over time, the drinking got worse, and I started using other substances too. It was a downward spiral, and I didn't know how to stop. ### Mentor: That sounds incredibly tough, Mentee. I imagine that getting sober was not an easy journey. ### Mentee: It definitely wasn't. I had to confront a lot of difficult emotions and learn how to cope with them in healthy ways. But now that I'm sober, I feel so much better about myself. I don't wake up feeling ashamed or guilty anymore, and I can focus on building a better life for myself. ### Mentor: That's amazing, Mentee. Congratulations on your sobriety. I'm so proud of the progress you've made. ### Mentee: Thank you, Mentor. I couldn't have done it without your guidance and support. It's been a journey, but I know that staying sober is the right choice for me. ### Mentor: I'm always here for you, Mentee. If you ever need to talk or want some advice, don't hesitate to reach out. And remember, living in the moment and savoring each moment of your sober life can help you stay focused and motivated on your journey.  ### Mentee: Thank you so much, Mentor.
