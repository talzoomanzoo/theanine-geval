    "raw_prediction": "It seems like Classmates A is about to express their feelings to Classmates B. Considering the previous conversation about trust, Classmates A might be hesitant but also seeking reassurance. Classmates B should respond with empathy and understanding, acknowledging Classmates A's feelings and being open to further discussion.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context seems to focus on a personal issue or confession from Classmate A to Classmate B about being unable to stop thinking about the latter. The related memory about trust does not provide contextually relevant information to assist in this situation, which seems to be about personal feelings rather than trust issues. \n\nJudgement: \"No\""
