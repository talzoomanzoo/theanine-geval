    "raw_prediction": "It's wonderful that you appreciate the beauty of nature and find peace in watching the sunrise. Remembering those moments can bring a sense of calm and hope, just like when we watched the sunrise together. Nature has a way of reminding us that there is always a new day and a chance to start fresh.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY provides context about the Parent's experience in juvenile detention and their eventual appreciation for the sunrise, which connects to recent dialogue about the Child and Parent watching a sunrise together and discussing overcoming tough times. This past information aligns with the conversation and could help the model provide a more nuanced and relevant response.\nJudgement: Yes"
