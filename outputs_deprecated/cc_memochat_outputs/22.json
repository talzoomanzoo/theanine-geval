    "raw_prediction": "Hey Neighbors B, I understand that the cold water incident might have been a bit much, but let's not dwell on it. How about we focus on planning that movie night we talked about earlier? It would be a great opportunity for us to spend some quality time together and have fun.",

The MEMORY doesn't provide helpful past information for continuing the current conversation about the prank.\nJudgement: \"No\""
