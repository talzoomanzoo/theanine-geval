How does it work?\nWell, I create the ads myself, and then I post them on my website. People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them.\nDo you think people will pay to see your ads?\nI don't know yet, but I hope so. I've put a lot of effort into creating some eye-catching ads.\nThat sounds cool, but why do you want to make money from ads?\nWell, I want to have some extra income coming in. Plus, I enjoy being creative and making things, so this is a great way for me to combine those passions.\nI see. Well, I hope it works out for you, Parent.\nThanks, Child. And who knows, maybe someday you can help me create some ads for the website.\nSure, that sounds like fun! Speaking of creativity, remember that time we made those homemade decorations together?\nYes, I do remember that. That was a fun afternoon.\nIt was! Maybe we can do that again someday.\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Household Chores', 'Related Summaries': 'Parent and Child discuss sharing household chores and create a schedule.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Parent: Why is everyone so upset with me?
