    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context revolves around feeling independent and not being a burden, while the memory includes information about learning to play an instrument. The context does not directly suggest the relevance or potential suggestion of playing an instrument as a method for gaining independence, making the memory information unrelated to the conversation. The MEMORY provided does not help in crafting a direct and relevant follow-up response based on independence as requested in the dialogue context.\n\nJudgement: No"
