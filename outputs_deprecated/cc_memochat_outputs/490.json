The MEMOR provided does not contain information relevant to the current conversation about software and computer knowledge; it talks about helping with homework and personal experiences unrelated to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, the MEMORY is not helpful in providing a response for the current context.\n\nJudgement: No"
