People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them.\nDo you think people will pay to see your ads?\nI don't know yet, but I hope so. I've put a lot of effort into creating some eye-catching ads.\nThat sounds cool, but why do you want to make money from ads?\nWell, I want to have some extra income coming in. Plus, I enjoy being creative and making things, so this is a great way for me to combine those passions.\nI see. Well, I hope it works out for you, Parent.\nThanks, Child.
