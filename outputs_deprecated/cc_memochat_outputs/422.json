    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about appreciating a supportive boss and the positive impact it has on motivation and job satisfaction. The MEMORY contains information related to friendship, collaboration, facing fears, and managing frustrations, which does not directly relate to the context of appreciating a supportive boss. Therefore, there is no past information in the MEMORY that is specifically helpful for generating a relevant response to the current context.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
