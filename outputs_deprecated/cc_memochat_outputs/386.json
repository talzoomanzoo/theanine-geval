But you got impatient and left without me, which disappointed me because I was counting on you. ### Husband: I'm sorry about that. I was really excited about what I was doing and I didn't think about how it would affect you. I'll make it up to you, I promise. ### Wife: Just remember that actions speak louder than words. I believe in you, but I need to know that I can count on you to keep your promises. ### Husband: I understand. You can count on me. ### Husband: I had such a great time at the dance with you. It was nice to have a break from everything and just enjoy spending time together. ### Wife: I agree, it was lovely to dance with you again. You're a great dancer. ### Husband: Thank you, I always enjoy dancing with you. It reminds me of when we first met and danced all night long. ### Wife: Yes, it was a magical night.

In fact, thinking about those dreams is what inspired me to take action and start making them happen. ### Wife: I'm glad to hear that.

You're so brave. ### Wife: Oh, that was nothing. I just knew I had to do something to protect the people around me. ### Husband: Well, that's what makes you so special to me. You always put others first and do what needs to be done. ### Wife: And that's why I love you. You have such a big heart and you're always working towards your dreams. I'm so proud of you. ### Husband: Thanks, I couldn't do it without your love and support.
