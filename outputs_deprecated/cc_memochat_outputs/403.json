    "raw_prediction": "It's okay, we all have embarrassing moments like that. Remember when we went on that field trip to Mars in middle school? We had each other's back then, and we still do now. Don't worry about it too much!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about past experiences and the importance of support, which could be relevant in reassuring and comforting Classmates B after the embarrassing incident. However, this specific MEMORY does not directly contribute to generating a response about the incident of spilling lunch, as the context is about a specific embarrassing event rather than general past experiences or support.\nJudgement: No"
