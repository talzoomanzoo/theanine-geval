    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about apologizing and understanding frustration, while the MEMORY pertains to acknowledging neighborly appreciation and kindness. The information in MEMORY does not relate to anger or frustration management, which is the main subject of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, MEMORY does not contain helpful information for generating a response in this context.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
