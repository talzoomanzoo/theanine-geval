    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about two people discussing future business plans that involve working together on a project. The MEMORY provided relates to previous conversations about coffee and friendship, which aren't pertinent to the current context of specific future business plans or a marketing agency. There is no information in the MEMORY that directly relates to or would assist in creating a proper response for the current dialogue about becoming business partners and working on social media marketing projects. Thus, MEMORY does not contain helpful past information for the current context.\n\nJudgement: No"
