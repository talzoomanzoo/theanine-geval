    "raw_prediction": "It's completely understandable to feel that way, Mentee. Starting over in a new city can be challenging, but remember that many others have felt the same at some point. It's an opportunity to step out of your comfort zone and make new connections. Perhaps try joining clubs or social events to meet like-minded individuals. Building new friendships takes time, so be patient and kind to yourself during this transition period.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY provided relates to the Mentee experiencing stress over college applications and receiving study advice from the Mentor. This does not help with generating a response related to feeling lonely in a new city and making new friends, which is the focus of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\nJudgement: \"No\""
