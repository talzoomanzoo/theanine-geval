This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\nHot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation?\nIt's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle.\nThat's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time?\nReally? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then.\nIt could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going?\nIt's going pretty well. I started with French, but now I'm considering taking up Spanish and German too. I want to become more well-rounded.\nThat's a great goal. Have you thought about any specific ways you could use your language skills?\nI would love to be able to travel more and speak with the locals in their native language. Maybe I could even teach my grandchildren some basic phrases.\nSpeaking of your grandchildren, how's your retirement planning going?\nIt's going well. I'm really looking forward to spending more time with them and taking them on fun trips.\nThat sounds like a great plan.
