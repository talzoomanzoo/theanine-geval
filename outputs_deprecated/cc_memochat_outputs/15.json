    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves the Mentee expressing loneliness in a new city and seeking advice on how to make new friends, whereas the MEMORY details a different issue—that of college application stress—and provides study tips and reassurance related to that problem. The MEMORY does not seem to offer relevant past information for addressing the Mentee's current situation about making friends or adapting to a new environment.\n\nJudgement: No"
