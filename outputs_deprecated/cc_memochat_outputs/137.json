    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about a scenario where someone moves to a new neighborhood and comments on exploration and making friends. However, the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about visiting a new city and does not relate to settling in or moving to a new neighborhood. The context focuses on travel experiences, not relocation experiences, so the memory is unrelated and unhelpful.\nJudgement: No"
