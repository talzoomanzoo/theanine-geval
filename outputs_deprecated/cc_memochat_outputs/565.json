I wish I could do things on my own.\nI understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others.\nYeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone.\nYou're not a burden, don't worry. And I'm always here to help you out.\nI appreciate that, but I don't want to always rely on others. I want to be more independent.\nI get it. Maybe there are some small things you can do on your own to start feeling more independent?\nLike what?\nWell, maybe you can start by making a list of things you'd like to do on your own and we can work on achieving those goals together.\nThat sounds like a good idea. Thanks for understanding, Classmates A.\nOf course, I'm always here to support you. Hey, speaking of goals, remember when we talked about your guitar playing a few months ago?

Have you thought about joining a band or playing gigs around town?\nNot really, I'm still a bit nervous about performing in front of people.\nI get it, performing can be scary. But maybe in a few months, we can work on setting a goal for you to do a small performance somewhere.\nThat sounds like a challenge, but also kind of exciting. I'm in!\nGreat, I'm looking forward to seeing you rock out on stage. Hey, remember when we talked about your new car a few hours ago? How's that going?\nI'm loving it! It's so much fun to drive. Thanks for asking, Classmates A.\nNo problem, glad to hear it. Hey, I remember a few months ago when you talked about being reminded of your childhood and feeling emotional. How are you feeling about that now?\nI'm still feeling a bit emotional about it, but I've also been trying to focus on making new positive memories to replace the old ones.\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Learning to play an instrument', 'Related Summaries': 'Classmates A talks about playing the guitar, taking lessons, and being in a band.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Classmates A: Hey, have you ever thought about learning to play an instrument? ### Classmates B: Yeah, I've considered it.
