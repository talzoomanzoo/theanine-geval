    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear that you're promoting under-the-radar artists on your new blog! I was inspired to start it because I believe in supporting and showcasing talented individuals who may not have the same visibility as mainstream artists. I want to help them get the recognition they deserve.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context is focused on a conversation about a new blog related to promoting under-the-radar artists. The memory provided is about life updates post high school, which is unrelated to the current discussion about blog inspiration and musical topics. Therefore, it doesn't contain helpful information for generating a response related to the blog.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
