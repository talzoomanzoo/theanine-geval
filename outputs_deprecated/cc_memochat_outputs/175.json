    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY does not contain any information relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is focused on the Parent's new advertising website and whether there will be an audience willing to pay for viewing the ads. The MEMORY is about adoption, which does not seem related to this business discussion. \nJudgement: No"
