    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves a person hiding from their mother and asking if the other person can keep a secret. The MEMORY contains a conversation about a person's telekinetic ability, which is unrelated to the current dialogue about hiding. The MEMORY does not provide information relevant or helpful for the next response required in this context.\nJudgement: No"
