    "raw_prediction": "That's totally understandable, everyone has their own preferences when it comes to working out. Maybe we can find other activities we both enjoy doing together, like cooking or watching movies. What do you think?",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around a light-hearted conversation where Neighbors A and B discuss past incidences and then reminisce about mowing the lawn. The MEMORY contains a related instance where the neighbors bond over chores, specifically mentioning mowing the lawn and becoming good friends. This shared experience and sentiment from the MEMORY could be helpful for the language model to generate an appropriate response by emphasizing camaraderie or suggesting similar joint activities. \nJudgement: Yes"
