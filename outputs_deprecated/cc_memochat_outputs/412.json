But it's not the first time I've heard reports of dog-napping in the area. ### Neighbors B: Are you suggesting that someone took my dog? ### Neighbors A: I'm just saying it's a possibility. But I promise you, I had nothing to do with it. ### Neighbors B: I trust you, but it's still strange. Do you remember when we were talking about how much I love my dog? It just breaks my heart to even think about someone taking him. ### Neighbors A: Yeah, I remember. And I know how much you love him, but I guess not everyone feels the same way. ### Neighbors B: Who in their right mind would take someone else's dog?
