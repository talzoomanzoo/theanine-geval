    "raw_prediction": "I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling lonely in your new city, Mentee. It's completely normal to miss your old friends when you're in a new environment. Remember, it takes time to build new connections and friendships. Maybe you could try joining clubs, groups, or activities that interest you to meet new people with similar interests. And don't hesitate to reach out to me whenever you need someone to talk to.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY focuses on the topic of college application stress and provides advice related to feeling overwhelmed. However, the DIALOGUE CONTEXT centers on the Mentee feeling lonely in a new city, which is unrelated to the specific advice given in the MEMORY. Therefore, the past information in MEMORY is not helpful for generating a response to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\nJudgement: No"
