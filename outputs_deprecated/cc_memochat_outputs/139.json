    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is focused on the experience of visiting a new city, Chicago, and does not suggest that past situations involving moving to a new neighborhood are relevant. The MEMORY is about settling in a new neighborhood, which is a different context from visiting a city for leisure. Therefore, the MEMORY does not contain helpful past information for this context.\nJudgement: \"No\""
