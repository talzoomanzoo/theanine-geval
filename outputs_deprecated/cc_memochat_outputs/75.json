    "raw_prediction": "It seems like you're feeling tired and wanting to relax at home instead of going to a family dinner. Maybe you can consider explaining your feelings to your mom so she understands. Remember, communication is key in any relationship.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context is focused on a personal situation where someone is hiding from their mom to avoid attending a family dinner. The memory provided is about telekinesis and does not relate to the context of the current conversation about family and personal choices. Thus, it does not contain relevant past information for generating an appropriate response.\nJudgement: No"
