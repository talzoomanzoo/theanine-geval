    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear that you have exciting plans for the future! I was thinking about starting a project related to coffee and friendship, inspired by our discussion earlier about the value of quality friendships over quantity. I believe it would be meaningful to explore how coffee can bring people together and strengthen relationships. What do you think about working on this project together?",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about a past interaction involving coffee and a discussion about friendships. However, in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, the topic is about exciting future plans and a potential business project, which does not seem related to the MEMORY about coffee and friendship. Therefore, the MEMORY does not contain relevant past information to assist in generating a response related to the business project conversation.\n\nJudgement: No"
