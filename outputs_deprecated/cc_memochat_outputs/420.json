    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context talks about gratitude towards a supportive boss, while the memory details discussions between co-workers about friendships, collaborations, and confronting fears and frustrations, which are unrelated to the context. Thus, the memory doesn't provide any relevant information for generating a response about a supportive boss.\nJudgement: \"No\""
