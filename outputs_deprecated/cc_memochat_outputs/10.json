It's an important skill to have in life.\nYeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nThat's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nDid you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you?\nYeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference.\nI'm glad you found someone to talk to. You know, I remember when we watched the sunrise together a few weeks ago. That was really special.\nIt was. I love being able to appreciate the beauty of nature. And you know, having my own place to live in the suburbs makes it even easier to do things like that.\nYeah, your house is really nice. You've always been good at taking care of yourself.\nWell, I've always valued my independence. Even as a kid, I wanted to do things on my own. That's why I decided to live on my own a few years ago.\nI can see why you would want to do that. You're just really good at being self-sufficient.\nThanks for saying that.
