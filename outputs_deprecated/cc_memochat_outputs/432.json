    "raw_prediction": "It's wonderful to hear that you are actively trying to understand someone else's perspective by imagining what they might be thinking. Empathy and understanding are key in building meaningful connections and relationships with others. Keep up the good work!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context revolves around the concept of empathy and understanding through imagining someone else's perspective, without requiring specific personal experiences of the Mentor or Mentee. The memory contains specific discussions about the Mentor's background and motivations, which are not directly relevant to the current topic of discussion. The context does not necessitate recalling past conversations to respond meaningfully.\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
