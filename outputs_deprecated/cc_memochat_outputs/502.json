    "raw_prediction": "That's fantastic to hear! Congratulations on your promotion and growth. It's evident that you've made significant progress since our past conversations. Keep up the great work!",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around a co-worker, who previously was considered irresponsible, sharing good news related to personal growth. MEMORY contains information about past conversations related to those perceived irresponsibilities and learning from past mistakes. This context matches the context in the current conversation where the co-worker reflects back and then shares personal growth news. Thus, MEMORY offers helpful past information for generating a relevant response.\nJudgement: Yes"
