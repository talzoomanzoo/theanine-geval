    "raw_prediction": "It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and stuck in your current job. Remember, it's okay to feel this way, but it's important to explore other options and not lose hope. Is there anything specific you're considering or need support with?",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context concerns a person's frustrations at work and feeling stuck in a dead-end job, while the memory involves making a mistake with a math problem and a desire for perfection. These topics are unrelated, as the frustration at work is unrelated to making or correcting mistakes. The memory does not contain relevant information that would help address work stress or a dead-end job scenario.\n\nJudgement: No"
