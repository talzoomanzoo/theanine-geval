You had a band?\nYeah, we were called \"The Neighbors A Band.\" We used to play live shows around the city.\nThat's awesome! What kind of music did you guys play?\nWe played rock music, mostly covers but we also wrote some of our own songs.\nHave you ever thought about starting the band again?\nNot really, it was just a fun hobby back then. Plus, I don't think I have the same energy as I did when I was younger.\nThat's understandable. Do you still play any instruments?\nI have a guitar but I haven't played it in a while. Maybe I should start practicing again.\nYeah, that sounds like a good idea.
