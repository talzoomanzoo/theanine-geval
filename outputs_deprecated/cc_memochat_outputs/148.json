I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations.\nI bet it was a nice change of scenery from our neighborhood.\nDefinitely. But you know, it's interesting how much our neighborhood has grown on me over the years. I remember when I first moved here, I was so unsure about it.\nYeah, I remember. But you stayed because you wanted to be here.\nThat's right. And since then, I've made so many great memories here. It's become my home.\nAnd you're still spending time with God every day, right?\nYes, I am. It brings me so much peace and happiness.\nThat's really admirable.

I can't even believe I had that kind of power over you.\nI'm just glad we've both grown since then, and we can have a friendship that's based on mutual respect.\nAbsolutely. And now, I'm excited to explore my new neighborhood and get to know the people here.
