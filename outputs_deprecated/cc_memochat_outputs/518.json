    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT does not seem to pertain to dealing with a loss or receiving support that is covered in the MEMORY. Instead, it suggests the end of a romantic relationship. The MEMORY provides examples of support during the grieving process, which is not directly applicable to the emotional context in the current scenario.\n\nJudgement: No"
