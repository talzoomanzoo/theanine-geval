What did you learn specifically?\nOh, a lot of things. I learned how to use different programs and software for different tasks, and how to choose the right one depending on what I need to do.\nDo you have any software recommendations for me? I always struggle with choosing the right program.\nIt really depends on what you need the software for. But for basic tasks like word processing or spreadsheet management, I would recommend Microsoft Office. It's user-friendly and versatile.\nThanks, I'll keep that in mind. Did you learn anything else in the course?\nYeah, I also learned some basic coding languages like HTML and CSS. It was challenging but really interesting.\nWow, that sounds cool.
