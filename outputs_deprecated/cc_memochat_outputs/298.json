    "raw_prediction": "It seems like you are trying to maintain clear boundaries and prevent misunderstandings with your neighbor. It's important to communicate openly and ensure mutual understanding to avoid any potential conflicts in the future.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The current dialogue context is about clearly marking property boundaries, ensuring both neighbors are on the same page about where one property ends and another begins. The provided MEMORY contains dialogues and information about a neighbor feeling overwhelmed and seeking support, which is unrelated to property boundaries or misunderstandings about them. Contextual information about personal stress does not aid in generating a more relevant response about property lines.\n\nJudgement: No"
