    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves Neighbor A feeling lost and overwhelmed due to a recent breakup, while Neighbor B offers emotional support and suggests going for a walk. MEMORY contains past evidence of Neighbor B providing similar emotional support when Neighbor A's grandmother passed away, also suggesting a walk. This past instance reinforces qualities of empathy and supportiveness that may aid in crafting a future response. The similar context of offering a walk to process emotions makes MEMORY relevant.\n\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
