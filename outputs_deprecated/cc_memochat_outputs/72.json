I think it would be worth it though. Imagine how much easier it would be to clean your house if you could just move everything with your mind. ### Neighbors B: That's true.

    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context consists of a simple exchange where one person is asking if the other can keep a secret. There is no indication that past discussions about telekinesis or any related topics are relevant to the continuation of the conversation. Therefore, the memory provided does not contain helpful information for generating a response in this context.\nJudgement: No"
