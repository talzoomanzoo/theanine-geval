    "raw_prediction": "No, I have never been in a physical altercation before. It's important to handle conflicts in a mature manner and to focus on presenting evidence and arguments persuasively to resolve disputes.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: In the dialogue context, the conversation shifts from public speaking to presenting evidence in court and then to a question about physical altercations. Although there is mention of presenting evidence, the memory related to court preparation does not seem directly relevant to the shift in context toward physical altercation. However, the conversation about handling conflicts and perception as dangerous may inform the question about physical altercations mentioned in the dialogue context, suggesting relevant past experience or perception in terms of handling conflicts.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
