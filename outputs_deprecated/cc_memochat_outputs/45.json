    "raw_prediction": "It's important to understand that love should never involve forcing someone against their will. It's crucial to respect the choices and feelings of others. Just like how you felt guilty about borrowing my pencil without asking, it's essential to recognize and correct your actions. Letting go of this obsession and moving on is the best course of action for everyone involved.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains a previous conversation where Co-workers A expresses guilt over borrowing a pencil without asking, which parallels his current situation of wanting to steal the bride. Co-workers B reassures A in the past situation, which may help B craft a response to A in the current context by drawing a comparison to change A's perspective on his plans with the bride.\nJudgement: Yes"
