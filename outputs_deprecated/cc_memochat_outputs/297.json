    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about a conversation regarding feeling overwhelmed and seeking support, which seems unrelated to the current discussion about property boundaries. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on clarifying property lines, and it does not appear to require past information to generate a proper response. Therefore, MEMORY does not contain relevant information for this specific context.\n\nJudgement: No"
