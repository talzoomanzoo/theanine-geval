    "raw_prediction": "It seems like you are reflecting on the importance of understanding different perspectives and being compassionate towards others, especially during difficult times. Remembering that everyone has unique experiences that shape their thoughts and actions can help us be more empathetic and supportive. Is there a specific situation or person you are thinking about in this context?",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The current dialogue context is focused on empathy and understanding others' perspectives. The memory contains information about the Mentor's personal experiences with leaving a restrictive community and their motivations for becoming a mentor to help others. While these past experiences may inform the Mentor's empathetic approach, the specific content in the dialogue context does not seem to require or directly relate to these specific experiences. Consequently, this memory is not necessary for generating a proper next response focused on the current empathy discussion.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
