    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves a conversation about one person singing a solo at church, with the other expressing surprise upon learning that they sang. The MEMORY provided does not relate to singing or prior information indicating awareness of such an activity. The memory contains a dialogue about weekend activities, puzzles, and a potential career as a detective, which is unrelated to the topic of singing. Therefore, the memory does not contribute helpful past information for response generation in the given dialogue context.\n\nJudgement: No"
