    "raw_prediction": "It's wonderful that you're actively working on understanding others' perspectives and being compassionate. Empathy and support are crucial, especially during challenging times. If you ever need guidance on how to further develop these skills, I'm here to help.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief Explanation: The current dialogue is about empathy and understanding others' perspectives. The memory provided involves the mentor's personal background and motivations related to helping others in restrictive situations, which seems unrelated to the specific topic of imagining thinking like someone else. There is no direct connection between the memory and the context of the dialogue that would aid a language model in generating a response specific to the current conversation on empathy.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
