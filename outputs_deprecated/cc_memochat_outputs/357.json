    "raw_prediction": "That's a great idea, Ted. Stopping at rest areas for breaks and staying hydrated will help us maintain our energy levels and focus during the long drive. It's important to take care of our bodies even outside of training or competition.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The current dialogue context discusses planning a road trip route and ensuring adequate rest and hydration during the drive. The MEMORY provided, related to dietary changes and energy levels, is not directly relevant to planning the driving route or discussing rest stops. The MEMORY reflects dietary habits that might impact energy, but it doesn't provide the specific past context needed for making decisions about the route or travel logistics.\nJudgement: No"
