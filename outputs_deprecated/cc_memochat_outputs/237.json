    "raw_prediction": "I understand that you were frustrated with your boss's unreasonable behavior at work. It's important to address these issues directly with your boss. Open communication can often lead to a better understanding and resolution of the situation.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about a past mistake in a math problem and the frustration related to it. This is not relevant or helpful to the current conversation about frustrations at work and dealing with an unreasonable boss. The context of swearing and temper is not directly related to making mistakes in mathematics or the desire for perfection in cleaning a tree house.\n\nJudgement: No"
