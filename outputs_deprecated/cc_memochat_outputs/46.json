    "raw_prediction": "It's important to acknowledge your feelings, Co-worker A, but it's crucial to understand the difference between guilt over a small act like borrowing a pencil and the serious consequences of actions like kidnapping. Seek support and professional help to work through your emotions and find healthier ways to cope.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The memory contains a past occurrence of Co-worker A expressing guilt over a minor incident and Co-worker B's supportive response. This helps highlight Co-worker A's pattern of feeling remorseful over actions and Co-worker B's role as a rational and guiding influence, both of which are mirrored in the current dialogue context where Co-worker A grapples with emotions concerning the bride.\nJudgement: Yes"
