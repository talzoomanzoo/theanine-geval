    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves embarrassment and support involving past incidents (spilling lunch and falling during a presentation). The MEMORY focuses on different past experiences, specifically a field trip to Mars and mentioning support during tough times. However, the DIALOGUE CONTEXT already contains a past incident relevant to embarrassment and handling it, so the MEMORY does not provide additional helpful past information.\nJudgement: \"No\""
