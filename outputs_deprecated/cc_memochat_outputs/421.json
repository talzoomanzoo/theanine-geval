You were so focused on your acting, I never would've guessed you had a talent for jewelry making too. ### Co-workers A: Yeah, I guess I surprise people sometimes. I remember when we talked about that time I blew up that rabbit with dynamite. It still makes me so angry when I think about it. ### Co-workers B: I know, it's understandable. That was a really terrible thing for those boys to do. But you know what? You've come a long way since then. You've grown as a person and as an artist. ### Co-workers A: Thanks, Co-worker B. I've definitely learned a lot about empathy and compassion since then. Like that time when I was a kid and I freaked out over a spider. I can look back now and see how silly it was, but at the time it felt very real to me. ### Co-workers B: I think a lot of people can relate to that. We all have our fears and anxieties. But you've shown that you can overcome those things. And now you're making these beautiful earrings! ### Co-workers A: Ha, yeah. It's funny how life works sometimes. You never know where it's going to take you. But I'm grateful for all the experiences that have led me here. ### Co-workers B: Me too, Co-worker A. And I can't wait to see what you create next. Who knows? Maybe you'll end up designing jewelry for a movie someday!' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me. ###Co-workers B: That's amazing to hear.
