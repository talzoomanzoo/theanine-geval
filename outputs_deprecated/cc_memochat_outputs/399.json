    "raw_prediction": "It sounds like you might be feeling embarrassed about something. Remember, it's okay to make mistakes or face challenges along the way. What matters is how you learn from them and keep pushing yourself to do better. Your determination and perseverance have always been admirable qualities, and they will help you overcome any obstacles you're facing now.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves a personal question about embarrassment, which could be clarified by additional context about Classmates B's current emotional state or situation. The MEMORY provided, however, contains information related to Classmates A's personal growth and determination and does not relate to Classmates B's feelings of embarrassment. Therefore, the MEMORY does not contain helpful information for this specific context.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
