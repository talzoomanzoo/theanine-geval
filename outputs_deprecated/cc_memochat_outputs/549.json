    "raw_prediction": "It sounds like you value independence and self-sufficiency. Remember, just like the freedom you feel when driving your new car, independence can also bring a sense of empowerment and liberation. You're not alone in feeling this way, and it's okay to seek support when needed.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY provided contains an unrelated topic of new car excitement and freedom associated with driving, which does not align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about feeling frustrated and dependent on others. There is no relevant past information in the MEMORY that would help generate a response about managing feelings of frustration or dependency.\n\nJudgement: No"
