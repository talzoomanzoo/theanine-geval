If there are any concerns or issues, it's best to address them openly and respectfully rather than resorting to drastic actions. Let's find a more appropriate and ethical way to handle the situation.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY contain similar information, as they both capture the plan of Co-worker A and Co-worker B's reaction to it. There is no additional helpful information in MEMORY that provides context or details for generating a new response. The context is straightforward and does not rely on past interactions or information for Unknown to generate a proper response.\nJudgement: \"No\""
