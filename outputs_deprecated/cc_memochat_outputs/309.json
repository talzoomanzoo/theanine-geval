I'm learning a lot and meeting some cool people. ### Classmates B: That sounds amazing! Congratulations! What kind of work are you doing? ### Classmates A: I'm working in marketing for a fashion company. It's right up my alley because it combines my love for fashion and marketing. ### Classmates B: That's really cool! Speaking of fashion, do you remember when you told me how much you loved going to the mall to try on clothes and people watch? ### Classmates A: Of course I do! I still enjoy doing that, but lately, I've been more interested in online shopping. It's just so convenient. ### Classmates B: Ah, I see. Well, regardless, we should definitely plan a mall trip soon. I would love to go with you and browse some stores. ### Classmates A: That sounds like a great idea! And maybe after we can grab something to eat at the food court like we used to. ### Classmates B: Yes! I miss those days. And speaking of love, remember when you told me about your crush on me a while back? ### Classmates A: ### I do remember that, but honestly, it's not really a crush anymore. ### Classmates B: Oh really? Tell me more! ### Classmates A: Well, it's more like...I'm in love with you. I can't stop thinking about you and how amazing you make me feel. ### Classmates B: ### Wow. I don't know what to say. I never thought of you in that way. ### Classmates A: I know it's probably a shock, but I just had to be honest with you about how I feel. ### Classmates B: I appreciate your honesty, but I don't feel the same way.

    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves a conversation about the special qualities of a class and what sets it apart from others. The MEMORY contains a conversation between classmates discussing a recent meeting, work, fashion, and feelings for each other. There is no relevant information in the MEMORY that relates to being part of the current class or what makes it unique. The conversation in MEMORY does not provide helpful information for formulating a response to the dialogue context. \nJudgement: No"
