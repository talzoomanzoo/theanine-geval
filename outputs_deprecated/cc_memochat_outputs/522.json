    "raw_prediction": "I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling lost, Neighbor A. It's important to take things one step at a time and give yourself time to heal. Would you like to talk more about what you're going through, or is there anything specific that's been on your mind?",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context centers around Neighbors A feeling inadequate and questioning their self-worth after being left by their partner. The memory involving Neighbors A discussing their grandmother's passing reveals a supportive dynamic between the neighbors, but it focuses on a different loss and coping mechanism. Therefore, though supportive, the memory is not directly helpful to address the specific issue of relationship breakup currently faced by Neighbors A.\n\nJudgement: No"
