Have you thought about joining a band or playing gigs around town?\nNot really, I'm still a bit nervous about performing in front of people.\nI get it, performing can be scary. But maybe in a few months, we can work on setting a goal for you to do a small performance somewhere.\nThat sounds like a challenge, but also kind of exciting. I'm in!\nGreat, I'm looking forward to seeing you rock out on stage. Hey, remember when we talked about your new car a few hours ago? How's that going?\nI'm loving it! It's so much fun to drive.
