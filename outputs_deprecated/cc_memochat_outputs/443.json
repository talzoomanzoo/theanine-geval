    "raw_prediction": "That's true, being able to support each other is essential in any relationship. If you ever need help with anything, don't hesitate to reach out.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is focused on the concept of mutual help and support in friendships. The MEMORY provided pertains to a conversation about apologizing as a sign of strength within relationships. While both relate to interpersonal dynamics, the MEMORY specifically focuses on apologizing, which is not directly relevant or necessary for addressing the simple affirmation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about helping each other. Therefore, the MEMORY does not contain helpful past information to aid response generation in this case.\n\nJudgement: No"
