    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains a dialogue about trust and reassurance, which could be helpful as Classmates A expresses concerns about being hurt and losing the friendship. The topic of trust and building a relationship on a foundation of friendship is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT because they are discussing taking their friendship to a deeper level. Hence, the MEMORY could provide useful context to support a response focused on reassurance and trust-building.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
