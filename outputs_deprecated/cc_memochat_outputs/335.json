    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is focused on reminiscing about a past rock band and discussing the possibility of restarting it. The MEMORY provided relates to a conversation about chiropractors and dealing with back pain, which is unrelated and not helpful to generating the next response in the context of discussing the band. Therefore, the MEMORY does not provide relevant information for the current conversation.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
