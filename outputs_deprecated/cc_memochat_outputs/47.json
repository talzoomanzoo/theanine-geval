    "raw_prediction": "It's important to address your feelings in a healthy way. Talking to a therapist or a trusted friend can provide you with support and guidance to work through your emotions effectively. It's essential to prioritize your well-being and seek help when needed.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The memory provides information about Co-workers A previously confessing a minor guilt about borrowing a pencil without asking. This is relevant because Co-workers A themselves draws a parallel between their current feelings and the past incident, using it to explain their emotions. The memory helps understand Co-workers A's pattern of feeling guilty but unable to resist certain actions, which is pertinent to the conversation about stealing someone away.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
