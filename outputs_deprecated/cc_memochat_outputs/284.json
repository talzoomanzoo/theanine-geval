    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context is primarily focused on a discussion about the sensations caused by hot sauce. The memory provides information about a student apologizing to a teacher, which is unrelated to the topic of hot sauce. Therefore, the memory does not contain helpful past information relevant to the current dialogue about spicy food.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
