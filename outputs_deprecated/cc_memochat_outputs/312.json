I would love to go with you and browse some stores. ### Classmates A: That sounds like a great idea! And maybe after we can grab something to eat at the food court like we used to. ### Classmates B: Yes! I miss those days.

I never thought of you in that way. ### Classmates A: I know it's probably a shock, but I just had to be honest with you about how I feel. ### Classmates B: I appreciate your honesty, but I don't feel the same way.
