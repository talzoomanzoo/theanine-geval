    "raw_prediction": "Why don't you pretend to have telekinetic abilities and move something in the room to distract your mom? It could be a fun way to play along with the situation!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about someone hiding from their mom, with no indication that telekinesis or any ability to move objects with the mind is relevant to the secret or situation. The MEMORY information about telekinetic ability is unrelated to the context of hiding from someone, thus not helpful for generating a response.\nJudgement: No"
