    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context revolves around the importance of listening, especially during tough times, while the memory focuses on independence and learning to ask for help. There is no direct connection or continuity between the listening-focused context and the help-seeking oriented memory. They are separate topics.\n\nJudgement: No"
