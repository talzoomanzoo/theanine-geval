It's been tough to get used to the early mornings, but I feel so much better throughout the day. ### Neighbors B: I can imagine. I've been trying to get into a workout routine myself, but it's been hard to stay motivated. ### Neighbors A: Yeah, it can definitely be a challenge. But once you start seeing results and feeling the benefits, it becomes easier. Plus, having a set routine helps. ### Neighbors B: That's true. Speaking of routines, how's your job going? Last time we talked, you had just been promoted to manager. ### Neighbors A: It's going really well. I've been working even harder and taking on more responsibilities, but it's been worth it.
