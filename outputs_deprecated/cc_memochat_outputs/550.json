    "raw_prediction": "Thanks for being open about your feelings. Remember, it's okay to rely on others sometimes. Just like how we used to support each other in our childhood memories, we can do the same now. Just let me know how I can help, and we'll work through this together.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about someone feeling frustrated and not wanting to be a burden, whereas the MEMORY contains information about childhood memories and playing music. The context doesn't seem to involve or require discussion about past events or interests, such as childhood or music, to generate a response. Therefore, the MEMORY does not include direct assistance or relevant information to help address the immediate feelings of frustration and dependency expressed in the dialogue.\nJudgement: \"No\""
