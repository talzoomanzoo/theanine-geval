    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves a general conversation about feeling fulfilled as a leader and guiding others. The MEMORY contains an unrelated conversation about Mary's mean behavior, which is not pertinent to the current discussion about fulfillment and leadership. Hence, the MEMORY does not contain helpful information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
