But thinking about how my hard work will pay off in the end keeps me going. ### Classmates B: I can relate to that. I remember when you threw your belt across the room in frustration a few months ago. Has it gotten any easier for you since then? ### Classmates A: Oh yeah, that was just a moment of frustration.
