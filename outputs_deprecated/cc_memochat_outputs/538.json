    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great find! Remember, finding alternative ways to have fun like camping can be both enjoyable and responsible. It's important to cherish these moments while making wise choices for your future.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about appreciating a view while camping and does not appear to require past information for generating the next response. The MEMORY, which is about responsibility and finding alternative fun, is unrelated to the current context and does not contain information that would help in crafting a suitable response in this situation.\nJudgement: No"
