    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains information related to Building Trust about Classmates A having doubts about trusting Classmates B. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about Classmates A expressing feelings for Classmates B and considering the potential for a romantic relationship. Trust is a foundational aspect of any relationship, and although the MEMORY is related to trust, it does not directly relate to the feelings and relationship exploration discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY does not contain information specifically relevant to relationship development or emotional expression, so it is not helpful in this context.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
