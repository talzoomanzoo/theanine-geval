    "raw_prediction": "I'm here for you, Neighbor A. It's important to communicate your feelings and thoughts with him. Would you like some advice on how to approach the situation?",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY is about Neighbors A dealing with the passing of their grandmother, and Neighbors B offering support by suggesting a walk in the park. The current DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about Neighbors A expressing shock and sadness over a breakup, which is a relationship context rather than bereavement. While both situations involve offering support during difficult times, the specific memory about the grandmother's passing does not provide direct information or context needed for generating a response related to the current context of a breakup. Therefore, the MEMORY does not contain helpful past information specific to this situation.\n\nJudgement: No"
