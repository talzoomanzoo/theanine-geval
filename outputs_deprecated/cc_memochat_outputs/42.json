    "raw_prediction": "Co-workers B: Co-workers A, I understand that you have strong feelings, but it's not right to take someone away against their will. Love should be about respect and understanding. Have you considered talking to the bride openly and honestly about your feelings instead of resorting to extreme actions?",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on an inappropriate plan involving the bride, which is a different context than intervening in a fight. The MEMORY doesn't provide relevant past information that applies to this context.\nJudgement: \"No\""
