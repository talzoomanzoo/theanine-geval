        "current_dialogue": "Husband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work. Wife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help. Husband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff. Wife: Nonsense! You can always come to me with anything. Plus, I enjoy helping you with your creative process. Have you also tried revisiting some of the writing prompts we did in our creative writing class? Husband: I have, but I feel like I'm just repeating the same stories over and over again. Wife: Maybe it's time to take a step back and try something new. Have you ever tried writing in a different genre or experimenting with different styles? Husband: That's a good idea. I guess I just haven't had the courage to step out of my comfort zone. Wife: Remember when you faced your fear of public speaking during your fifth-grade presentation? You can do this too. Sometimes, the biggest breakthroughs come from taking risks. Husband: You're right. Maybe it's time to try something completely different and see where it takes me.",

        "raw_prediction": "I'm glad you're open to trying new things. Remember, I'll always be here to support you, no matter what direction your writing takes. Just believe in yourself and your creativity, and you'll see amazing results.",
        "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some elements that could be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the mention of the husband's nervousness before a presentation (which ties into the wife's suggestion to step out of one's comfort zone) and the wife's encouragement to embrace individuality, although these are not directly addressed in the context provided. However, much of the MEMORY contains information that doesn't directly help with generating a continuation of the current dialogue, such as discussions about modern language, a past partner, and falling asleep during a movie. These details don't appear relevant to the discussion of creativity and taking risks in writing. Therefore, the MEMORY offers limited helpful information connected to the current dialogue while including detailed aspects that are not very connected, earning it a low score."
