Additionally, MEMORY 3 mentions Speaker B's girlfriend enjoying pandas and penguins, which could be relevant in discussing zoo visits, aligning with the conversation's current trajectory about plans and interests related to the zoo.\n\nHowever, some sentences (like MEMORY 2, 3, and 5 about Speaker A's experiences) either don't directly relate to the current context or don't offer a natural sequential connection to what Speaker A has been discussing.

You definitely don't want to get stuck in a bad situation in the cold, especially if you're alone. I bet they have great ice cream! You'll have to tell me about it when you get back! Speaker B: Yeah, I need to call my friend and find out what season they are in so I can pack accordingly. I will take pictures of the ice cream too so I can tell you about it. I wonder if there are a lot of bears there? I don't like bears either. Speaker A: I'm pretty sure they have grizzlies up there. You better pack something to fend them off too just in case. I bet your friend knows everything you'd need to keep them away. Speaker B: I will bring whatever they let me bring on the airplane, but I am really counting on my friend to help me out with the local customs lol. Do you know if Rocky and Bullwinkle were from Alaska?  Speaker A: No, they were from Minnesota. Are you going to have your friend be your hiking guide? Speaker B: I invited my friend to come stay at the lodge where I'm vacationing and he said it would be fun to get away for a bit. So I'm hoping he will show me around for a week or so. I might have to hire a hiking guide, it depends on how much he knows about hiking and grizzlies I think. What do you think? Should I hire someone? Speaker A: I think it could be a good idea, especially with all the large animals in Alaska and the terrain. I wouldn't rely on your friend and have someone more professional that knows a lot just in case. I'm sure the guide could also give you tons of suggestions of things to do while in the area, and maybe even the best ice cream places lol!\n\nMEMORY:\n1.

Speaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do. Speaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars. Speaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there,  Speaker A: You'd have to get some serious blackout curtains for when it was daylight lol! You'll have to stock up on some warm essentials before heading out.

        "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information, such as Speaker B planning an Alaskan vacation and Speaker A mentioning outdoor activities like hiking. However, the memory contains inaccuracies, such as stating Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together, which does not align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the MEMORY lacks specific details that connect to the particular conversation about daylight periods, encountering bears, or ice cream, which were central to the discussion. Therefore, while there are some connections between the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, they are not strong or specifically helpful for generating a next response."
