I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone. ###Speaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you? ###Speaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know. ###Speaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient!  ###Speaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends? ###Speaker B: No not at all but if you didn't feel comfortable talking to me I can recommend a couple of my colleagues who are just as brilliant ###Speaker A: I'd prefer to see you since I'm already comfortable talking to you! It will get the awkward part out of the way for me! ### \n\n``` Speaker A Input:",

I was thinking about getting a pair of cats, but I haven't committed yet. How nice fo ryou to have company when you're walking though! What kind of dog do you have?\nCats can be nice! I used to have cats, but am allergic to them and had to give them to my friend. I have an Australian Kelpie who is a rescue. She is very energetic and smart!\nI had cats as a child and I think that they're a bit easier to care for than dogs, especially in the city. I am a dog lover as well though; Australian Kelpies are gorgeous! What is her name? Does she walk well off-leash?\nYes, cats are very smart and clean. Mine used to bring me a mouse to throw for her, just like a dog! And if you have 2 cats, they play with each other! Mine would run up and down the halls in the middle of the night, haha. Her name is Kyrie, and she walks off leash and is very obedient. Dogs might be hard to keep in your small apartment though, since Kyrie likes to play in the field, run with cars along the fence row, and herd goats. \nOh wow! So Kyrie is a working dog?

What do you do? ### Speaker A: I love playing flute but that is not what I do for living. ### Speaker B: Do you play in a band or symphony? ### Speaker A: Get to spend more time with your son and grandkids? ### Speaker B: I did it was a great time, we went to the park! ### Speaker A: That is always a great way to spend time with kids. ### Speaker B: Most definitely, for sure the moments I cherish in life. Have  you got to spend time with your kids? ### Speaker A: Work has kept me away from them more than I would like, unfortunately.  ### Speaker B: That is unfortunate but I know how that goes. My mom was a libraian, so she was always busy helping people ### Speaker A: It is a taxing job, but very rewarding. ### Speaker B: Most definitely, I think the rewards ulitmately make it worth it, plus your kids can get any book they want! ### Speaker A: That is a huge perk! Kids don't read enough these days.  ### Speaker B: I know! I feel like most kids would struggle even finding a book in a library, internet has made it easy for them! ### Speaker A: No kidding. Things sure have changed over the years. ### Speaker B: I know! I can't remember the last time my grandkids asked to go to the libary. ### Speaker A: Have you ever thought about taking your grandkids to a library and explaining what your mom did for a living as a librarian? It could be a great learning field trip for them.  ### Speaker B: Kids just don't seem to be interested in going to the library anymore. ### Speaker A: I agree, I see libraries closing more and more. Even school libraries are half the size they use to be. ### Speaker B: I'm not really sure of a solution to keep libraries open. With the rise of the internet people do not need them as much as I used to. ### Speaker A: That is basically it. Everything is becoming electronic. Paper books are not really needed, only people who cherish a real book keep them relevant. ### Speaker B: I do find it interesting that libraries now are finding creative ways to still stay relevant like creating little maker spaces.  Some are adding 3D printers and other tools to keep kids learning and entertained in a safe environment ### Speaker A: Yes we implement those in our library. We still get parents bringing in their little kids which I find encouraging ### Speaker B: Not only will the kids learn but the parents will also learn new skills to ### Speaker A: even librarians like me learn new skills too, lol ### Speaker B: That's true you're never too old to learn a new skill ### Speaker A: :), so how was the trip to the park with your grandkids? ### Speaker B: It was great the weather was really nice and I really enjoyed getting outside and getting some fresh air ### Speaker A: My youngest child just asked me if I could teach them how to play the flute! ### Speaker B: Oh really? So they want to play the flute like you. That's wonderful to hear. Are you planning to teach them yourself or hire a teacher? ### Speaker A: I am going to teach them myself. I am just so proud that they came to me and asked for my help. It was nice to feel wanted by my kids.  ### Speaker B: I bet is a wonderful feeling. I took my grandkids fishing once because they asked me to. It's a great way to bond with them. Now you and your youngest can bond through music. I think that's wonderful. ### Speaker A: Yes, I am so glad we can spend some time together and bond over flutes. She wants to learn because of the singer Lizzo. She can play the flute so well that it inspired her. Have you heard of her? ### Speaker B: Ah no I have not. I'm sure one of my grandkids have. Are they very famous? I'm a bit out of touch with music these days. ### Speaker A: Yes she is famous. Me too. I am a bit out of touch too with the latest music.

Have  you got to spend time with your kids? ### Speaker A: Work has kept me away from them more than I would like, unfortunately.  ### Speaker B: That is unfortunate but I know how that goes.

Things sure have changed over the years. ### Speaker B: I know! I can't remember the last time my grandkids asked to go to the libary. ### Speaker A: Have you ever thought about taking your grandkids to a library and explaining what your mom did for a living as a librarian? It could be a great learning field trip for them.  ### Speaker B: Kids just don't seem to be interested in going to the library anymore. ### Speaker A: I agree, I see libraries closing more and more. Even school libraries are half the size they use to be. ### Speaker B: I'm not really sure of a solution to keep libraries open. With the rise of the internet people do not need them as much as I used to. ### Speaker A: That is basically it. Everything is becoming electronic. Paper books are not really needed, only people who cherish a real book keep them relevant. ### Speaker B: I do find it interesting that libraries now are finding creative ways to still stay relevant like creating little maker spaces.  Some are adding 3D printers and other tools to keep kids learning and entertained in a safe environment ### Speaker A: Yes we implement those in our library. We still get parents bringing in their little kids which I find encouraging ### Speaker B: Not only will the kids learn but the parents will also learn new skills to ### Speaker A: even librarians like me learn new skills too, lol ### Speaker B: That's true you're never too old to learn a new skill ### Speaker A: :), so how was the trip to the park with your grandkids? ### Speaker B: It was great the weather was really nice and I really enjoyed getting outside and getting some fresh air ### Speaker A: My youngest child just asked me if I could teach them how to play the flute! ### Speaker B: Oh really? So they want to play the flute like you. That's wonderful to hear. Are you planning to teach them yourself or hire a teacher? ### Speaker A: I am going to teach them myself. I am just so proud that they came to me and asked for my help. It was nice to feel wanted by my kids.  ### Speaker B: I bet is a wonderful feeling. I took my grandkids fishing once because they asked me to. It's a great way to bond with them. Now you and your youngest can bond through music. I think that's wonderful. ### Speaker A: Yes, I am so glad we can spend some time together and bond over flutes. She wants to learn because of the singer Lizzo. She can play the flute so well that it inspired her. Have you heard of her? ### Speaker B: Ah no I have not. I'm sure one of my grandkids have. Are they very famous? I'm a bit out of touch with music these days. ### Speaker A: Yes she is famous. Me too. I am a bit out of touch too with the latest music. My daughter played the video of her playing the flute and singing. It was incredible. I am glad she found a motivation though. Can any of your kids play an instrument? ### Speaker B: No not my kids or grandkids. They spend so much time on their phones and tablets that they rarely take interest in such things. It would be wonderful if one of them did take an interest in music. Is your youngest the only one interested in musical intrustments right now? ### Speaker A: Yes at the moment. My other two are just like yours - addicted to tablets and phones. I hoping that when I start teaching my youngest the flute the others would want to join in. I will grab a few spare just in case. Did you ever take your kids fishing? Did they like it? ### Speaker B: They sure did. Even though the oldest girl was so busy with her texting and what not.

My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do. ###Speaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars. ###Speaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there,  ###Speaker A: You'd have to get some serious blackout curtains for when it was daylight lol! You'll have to stock up on some warm essentials before heading out. You definitely don't want to get stuck in a bad situation in the cold, especially if you're alone. I bet they have great ice cream! You'll have to tell me about it when you get back! ###Speaker B: Yeah, I need to call my friend and find out what season they are in so I can pack accordingly. I will take pictures of the ice cream too so I can tell you about it. I wonder if there are a lot of bears there?

When I was a kid bouncing on a trampoline, a squirrel jumped down from the tree it was on and landed on the trampoline. Due to my super energetic jumping, he flew for a moment! I guess that's not really an \"invention\" though. Do you ever invent things with your programming experience? ### Speaker B: LOL!  You had me going there for a minute.

I am really good at coding and automating systems, but I haven't really made my own thing. ### Speaker A: I see. I forgot about Rocky and Bullwinkle. That used to be my favorite cartoon. I even watched the live action movies. Thanks for the throwback! I think you just teleported me to my childhood bedroom. I appreciate the free ride down memory lane!

Not to say a free plane ticket wouldn't be nice, but you might just set me on a trampoline and send me flying too! ### Speaker A: That I can do! I'm not sure the squirrel would recommend that method of transportation though, but as long as you sign some liability paperwork before hand, I am good to go! ### Speaker B: Wheeee!

I'm not trying to get eaten ha I think it would be cool to see a moose though.   ### Speaker A: Good to hear, that way I know you will be safe! I would love to see a moose in person.

And sometimes when you want to go somewhere, you just want to go, and it's hard to coordinate with others.

I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round. ###Speaker A: I would definitely recommend looking for a rental car to have on hand. There is a town within walking distance from me, but it can be dangerous to walk with the wolves and elk around, especially at night. ###Speaker B: I imagine so!!! I wouldn't want to run into a wolf! Ok. I will add car rental to my plans. Do you get scared with your dogs, that you will run into wildilfe like that? ###Speaker A: I think I'm more afraid of the wildlife than my dogs are. If I had to, I think I could muster the courage to face the animals out here, but I will happily avoid them when possible. With you around, I'd feel much better, as well. How do you feel about being that close to wildlife? ###Speaker B: Well I don't have a lot of experience with that but I guess I'd be ok as long as I knew what to do. Most of the wildlife I see is squirrels, pigeons, and the occasional possum.  ###Speaker A: We have plenty of those out here, as well, and you'll see them far more often than you'll see wolves. We will just have to take extra precautions at night and make sure we don't leave any food outside that might attract them. ### \n\n``` Speaker A Input:",

What was it like growing up?  Did she always fix huge meals when you visited? ### Speaker B: Yep. She was definitely the matriarch and kept us together with family dinners. Whenever we'd go over, it would be about 12 of us, with my parents, uncles and aunts, and two of my cousins. We'd pitch in in different ways but grandma was the boss.

At first, it was interesting, but now it's boring. I hope to get a promotion, so I can learn something interesting again. Haha. I'm sure working with animals is an everyday thrill. ### Speaker A: I'd gladly have you help out for a few days if I could! The excrement won't pick itself up, unfortunately. You would get to feed some penguins to make up for that though. ### Speaker B: Haha. That sounds like a lovely time. How do you get the fish smell off of your hands afterwards? ### Speaker A: You don't :### Speaker B: The only thing that gets the grease off is dish soap. Have you ever tried vinegar? I heard it neutralizes a lot of odors. ### Speaker A: How is your job going? Have you thought about doing something you find more fulfilling?  ### Speaker B: To be honest I\u2019m at the end of my tether.... I\u2019m out of here as soon as I have someone decent in hand! ### Speaker A: I can talk to the administration out here at the zoo to see if you'd be able to qualify for an entry level position here if you want! ### Speaker B: Omg... that would be like a dream come true... I\u2019ll take anything at this point and trust me you won\u2019t regret it! Truly appreciate the referral... I feel good just thinking about the possibility:) ### Speaker A: I'll send them an email later today. I can't guarantee the work will be fabulous in any manner, usually the entry level positions start out cleaning enclosures and feeding less dangerous animals. But the pay is pretty decent and usually they'll provide on the job training. If you can get into a full time position they also offer benefits and help to pay for schooling so you can progress in the field more quickly! ### Speaker B: You have no idea how grateful I am for this opportunity!

How is your interview practice going?  I am pretty sure you be excellent during it! ###Speaker A: I think this discussion is helping me with making small talk, so thanks.  I just have to try and remember who i am and try to sell my good points. ###Speaker B: That is a good approach.  I suppose you have been doing research on the company you are interviewing with?  I find it always helps to know the company as best you can for an interview. ###Speaker A: Yes. Thanks for the reminder.  I have a couple of more companies to research today.  Of course, it is always interesting to figure out what a company's corporate culture is. ### \n\n``` Speaker A Input:\nRecent Dialogs: Speaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you? ###Speaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses. ###Speaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set? ###Speaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up. ###Speaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe? ###Speaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood. ###Speaker A: Chemicals!

Which recipe do you think I should start with? ###Speaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients.

What's the easiest thing to start with? ### Speaker A: Well something like a cup is super easy, other things require cutting the paper.I haven't tried that many, but we can try some together ### Speaker B: That sounds like a great idea. I would really like to make origami animals. It think it'd be cute. Are those hard to make? ### Speaker A: Well it depend on if you're talking about just their heads or if you want to make their whole body, I think the heads are easier. ### Speaker B: I would prefer to make their whole bodies, just a head seems a bit weird.

Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing? ###Speaker A: Yea, I think for the more complicated origami it's kind of a use it or lose it but for the simple stuff you can usually take a couple months of and still remember to do it! Did you see origami in Japan? ###Speaker B: Not up close, but I noticed a lot in shop windows in certain areas. I love Japan -- they're so welcoming. One of our acquaintances GAVE me a kimono. She said it's customary to try to share their culture. Kind of different from America in my opinion.   ###Speaker A: Oh, that sounds wonderful.

I did different numbers for all of my 50 tickets so I have 50 chances. ### Speaker B: Yeah, both strategies have their pros and cons.  But if I win I want it to be on the news.
