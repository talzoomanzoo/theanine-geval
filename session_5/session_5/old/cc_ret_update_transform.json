Mentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here. Mentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people. Mentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering. Mentor: And remember, it's also important to keep in touch with your old friends. You can schedule video calls or even plan a visit back home. Mentee: That's true, I'll make sure to keep in touch. Thanks for the advice, Mentor. Mentor: Anytime, Mentee. Is there anything else you want to talk about or any updates you'd like to share?
