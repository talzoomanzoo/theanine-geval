Kids don't read enough these days.  ### Speaker B: I know! I feel like most kids would struggle even finding a book in a library, internet has made it easy for them! ### Speaker A: No kidding. Things sure have changed over the years. ### Speaker B: I know! I can't remember the last time my grandkids asked to go to the libary. ### Speaker A: Have you ever thought about taking your grandkids to a library and explaining what your mom did for a living as a librarian? It could be a great learning field trip for them.  ### Speaker B: Kids just don't seem to be interested in going to the library anymore. ### Speaker A: I agree, I see libraries closing more and more. Even school libraries are half the size they use to be. ### Speaker B: I'm not really sure of a solution to keep libraries open. With the rise of the internet people do not need them as much as I used to. ### Speaker A: That is basically it. Everything is becoming electronic. Paper books are not really needed, only people who cherish a real book keep them relevant. ### Speaker B: I do find it interesting that libraries now are finding creative ways to still stay relevant like creating little maker spaces.  Some are adding 3D printers and other tools to keep kids learning and entertained in a safe environment ### Speaker A: Yes we implement those in our library. We still get parents bringing in their little kids which I find encouraging ### Speaker B: Not only will the kids learn but the parents will also learn new skills to ### Speaker A: even librarians like me learn new skills too, lol ### Speaker B: That's true you're never too old to learn a new skill ### Speaker A: :), so how was the trip to the park with your grandkids? ### Speaker B: It was great the weather was really nice and I really enjoyed getting outside and getting some fresh air ### Speaker A: My youngest child just asked me if I could teach them how to play the flute! ### Speaker B: Oh really? So they want to play the flute like you. That's wonderful to hear. Are you planning to teach them yourself or hire a teacher? ### Speaker A: I am going to teach them myself. I am just so proud that they came to me and asked for my help. It was nice to feel wanted by my kids.  ### Speaker B: I bet is a wonderful feeling. I took my grandkids fishing once because they asked me to. It's a great way to bond with them. Now you and your youngest can bond through music. I think that's wonderful. ### Speaker A: Yes, I am so glad we can spend some time together and bond over flutes. She wants to learn because of the singer Lizzo. She can play the flute so well that it inspired her. Have you heard of her? ### Speaker B: Ah no I have not. I'm sure one of my grandkids have. Are they very famous? I'm a bit out of touch with music these days. ### Speaker A: Yes she is famous. Me too. I am a bit out of touch too with the latest music. My daughter played the video of her playing the flute and singing. It was incredible. I am glad she found a motivation though. Can any of your kids play an instrument? ### Speaker B: No not my kids or grandkids. They spend so much time on their phones and tablets that they rarely take interest in such things. It would be wonderful if one of them did take an interest in music. Is your youngest the only one interested in musical intrustments right now? ### Speaker A: Yes at the moment. My other two are just like yours - addicted to tablets and phones. I hoping that when I start teaching my youngest the flute the others would want to join in. I will grab a few spare just in case. Did you ever take your kids fishing? Did they like it? ### Speaker B: They sure did. Even though the oldest girl was so busy with her texting and what not.

Today was a good day since I got to play with my son's kids. You? ### Speaker A: I love kid too, but I dont have much time with them am a librarian. ### Speaker B: That is interesting. My mother also had the same profession as you. ### Speaker A: Thats cool I have 3 children does your mother has the same thing? ### Speaker B: No but I had a lot of kids.. ### Speaker A: Are they up to nine my is below the age of nine. ### Speaker B: They are all grown up now and have kids of their own. ### Speaker A: Really, how do they go to work everyday is it by boat like me? ### Speaker B: Most of them take the subway. What do you do? ### Speaker A: I love playing flute but that is not what I do for living. ### Speaker B: Do you play in a band or symphony? ### Speaker A: Get to spend more time with your son and grandkids? ### Speaker B: I did it was a great time, we went to the park! ### Speaker A: That is always a great way to spend time with kids. ### Speaker B: Most definitely, for sure the moments I cherish in life. Have  you got to spend time with your kids? ### Speaker A: Work has kept me away from them more than I would like, unfortunately.  ### Speaker B: That is unfortunate but I know how that goes. My mom was a libraian, so she was always busy helping people ### Speaker A: It is a taxing job, but very rewarding. ### Speaker B: Most definitely, I think the rewards ulitmately make it worth it, plus your kids can get any book they want! ### Speaker A: That is a huge perk! Kids don't read enough these days.  ### Speaker B: I know! I feel like most kids would struggle even finding a book in a library, internet has made it easy for them! ### Speaker A: No kidding. Things sure have changed over the years. ### Speaker B: I know! I can't remember the last time my grandkids asked to go to the libary. ### Speaker A: Have you ever thought about taking your grandkids to a library and explaining what your mom did for a living as a librarian? It could be a great learning field trip for them.  ### Speaker B: Kids just don't seem to be interested in going to the library anymore. ### Speaker A: I agree, I see libraries closing more and more. Even school libraries are half the size they use to be. ### Speaker B: I'm not really sure of a solution to keep libraries open. With the rise of the internet people do not need them as much as I used to. ### Speaker A: That is basically it. Everything is becoming electronic. Paper books are not really needed, only people who cherish a real book keep them relevant. ### Speaker B: I do find it interesting that libraries now are finding creative ways to still stay relevant like creating little maker spaces.  Some are adding 3D printers and other tools to keep kids learning and entertained in a safe environment ### Speaker A: Yes we implement those in our library. We still get parents bringing in their little kids which I find encouraging ### Speaker B: Not only will the kids learn but the parents will also learn new skills to ### Speaker A: even librarians like me learn new skills too, lol ### Speaker B: That's true you're never too old to learn a new skill ### Speaker A: :), so how was the trip to the park with your grandkids? ### Speaker B: It was great the weather was really nice and I really enjoyed getting outside and getting some fresh air ### Speaker A: My youngest child just asked me if I could teach them how to play the flute! ### Speaker B: Oh really? So they want to play the flute like you. That's wonderful to hear. Are you planning to teach them yourself or hire a teacher? ### Speaker A: I am going to teach them myself. I am just so proud that they came to me and asked for my help. It was nice to feel wanted by my kids.  ### Speaker B: I bet is a wonderful feeling. I took my grandkids fishing once because they asked me to. It's a great way to bond with them. Now you and your youngest can bond through music. I think that's wonderful. ### Speaker A: Yes, I am so glad we can spend some time together and bond over flutes. She wants to learn because of the singer Lizzo. She can play the flute so well that it inspired her. Have you heard of her? ### Speaker B: Ah no I have not. I'm sure one of my grandkids have. Are they very famous? I'm a bit out of touch with music these days. ### Speaker A: Yes she is famous. Me too. I am a bit out of touch too with the latest music. My daughter played the video of her playing the flute and singing. It was incredible. I am glad she found a motivation though. Can any of your kids play an instrument? ### Speaker B: No not my kids or grandkids. They spend so much time on their phones and tablets that they rarely take interest in such things. It would be wonderful if one of them did take an interest in music. Is your youngest the only one interested in musical intrustments right now? ### Speaker A: Yes at the moment. My other two are just like yours - addicted to tablets and phones. I hoping that when I start teaching my youngest the flute the others would want to join in. I will grab a few spare just in case. Did you ever take your kids fishing? Did they like it? ### Speaker B: They sure did. Even though the oldest girl was so busy with her texting and what not.

Not too exciting ### Speaker A: Well I am excited for this adventure for you! Are you traveling alone or are you going with friends or family? ### Speaker B: I'm traveling alone, but I'm planning on trying to meet up with a friend who lives up there for visit if our schedules work out. ### Speaker A: That would great! I am impressed, I am nervous to travel alone. I prefer having someone around I know when I am on new adventures.  ### Speaker B: I don't mind it.  And sometimes when you want to go somewhere, you just want to go, and it's hard to coordinate with others.  I'm always up for a traveling pal though ### Speaker A: Have you made plans with your friend to get together when you get to Alaska? Does your friend enjoy action movies too?  ### Speaker B: we are working on plans currently. trying to get our schedules lined up. I'm not sure if they like action movies or not.  ### Speaker A: two weeks of the great alaska. have you decided how you spend your time outdoors. ### Speaker B: lots of hiking and trying not to get eaten by mosquitoes. lol ### Speaker A: what else is alaska known for? what can visitors expect besides hiking? ### Speaker B: i'm not sure honestly.

I wish my teacher was better, or at least made the topic interesting.  It's so boring in his class that I have a hard time paying attention. ### Speaker B: It is for my sport medicine. It is the last one of the class I have made A's all year so hopefully I can pass this one also and I'll be done. ### Speaker A: Oh nice!  I wish that I could get all A's.  I'm more of a B and occasional C student.  The only guaranteed A I have is in gym, haha ### Speaker B: I think everyone gets an A in gym. I have studied really hard to get those As I want to pass with good grades. I figure it would help me get a good job afterwards. ### Speaker A: I'm sure it will.  My sister got good grades in school and ended up with a great teaching job.  I know it's not the same, but it definitely helped her.

Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future? ###Speaker B: I would love to get back to Italy but need to save up and the hopeful priority is to Greece this year.  You have friends in Europe are you in contact to see what plans you can make? ###Speaker A: Yes I've been talking to them quite a bit so they know what's going on. I'll be staying with some of them while I'm over there. I have never been to Greece....I'd like to go though. Maybe I'll add it to my itinerary! Maybe we could plan to be in Greece at the same time?! ###Speaker B: That would be so good.  There is so much history and the roman statues i take my daughter to see in the museums and through our local resources is fab.  She is building up the passion which is lovely to see.  Have you still got your hair blue or has it grown out now? ###Speaker A: That's awesome! Maybe you can teach me a little about all the mythology. I think I've never liked it before only because I didn't understand it. My hair is back to being its natural brown - lol I'm being boring for the moment. ###Speaker B: Never boring you will keep styling it all sorts of interesting styles im sure.  Yes i would be lovely to be your guide for the day out in Greece.  Bring some decent walking boots and some sun cream, its a different heat out there but your tan is probably topped up with going to the beach each day. ###Speaker A: That's good advice! Thank you! I saw on the news Cali has been getting a lot of rain. Have you still been able to run on the beach each day? ###Speaker B: I've got very wet most days unfortunately but need to keep up with the exercise.  Been taking to the gym to keep dry.  When im not out in the surf of a morning first thing on the weekends, to avoid the crowds as you know im not too good at the surfing but its good fun.  ###Speaker A: That's great you've kept your routine though! I want to learn to surf someday!!! ### \n\n``` Speaker A Input:",

Lol, it took me a moment to realize you were talking about the CAT's wee one! What does the kitten look like? ### Speaker A: Bahaha! Hilarious. She's an orange and white striped, just like her mama. Tabby cat. My cat's name is Ginger. I'm thinking about calling the wee one Marmalade or something like that. ### Speaker B: Little lady marmalade! Haha! She sounds adorable!  ### Speaker A: She's definitely a cutie. I wasn't sure about having another cat but as I've gotten to know her, I've gotten too attached to let her go to someone else!' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin! ###Speaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name?  ###Speaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls!  ###Speaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well? ###Speaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens. ### \n\n``` Speaker A Input:\nRecent Dialogs: Speaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name.

Get some outlandish curtains and hang up a bead door to the room and call it the chill room where colors mesh and collide to make an inspiring hippy feel.

Maybe you could even get some on the couches or on the wood furniture just for fun.
