I'll keep working on a teleport machine. For now, you'll have to get there with more traditional means. So, airplane it is? Have you ever been on a flight before. ### Speaker B: I have been on it a couple times.  My mother said it was powered by pixie dust and I believed her for the longest time!  I am not too scared to go this time.  Have you invented any flying things? ### Speaker A: Squirrels! When I was a kid bouncing on a trampoline, a squirrel jumped down from the tree it was on and landed on the trampoline. Due to my super energetic jumping, he flew for a moment! I guess that's not really an \"invention\" though. Do you ever invent things with your programming experience? ### Speaker B: LOL!  You had me going there for a minute.  I could just see that sucker flying in my mind.  \"Hey Bullwinkle, where's Rocky....\"  LOL  Good one!  I am really good at coding and automating systems, but I haven't really made my own thing. ### Speaker A: I see. I forgot about Rocky and Bullwinkle. That used to be my favorite cartoon. I even watched the live action movies. Thanks for the throwback! I think you just teleported me to my childhood bedroom. I appreciate the free ride down memory lane! I wish I could pay you back with a free plane ticket. ### Speaker B: It's ok!  You gave me the biggest laugh today so I think we are even!  Not to say a free plane ticket wouldn't be nice, but you might just set me on a trampoline and send me flying too! ### Speaker A: That I can do! I'm not sure the squirrel would recommend that method of transportation though, but as long as you sign some liability paperwork before hand, I am good to go! ### Speaker B: Wheeee!  I'm just being so silly now.  Who needs a therapist when we can keep each other so happy? ### Speaker A: What is on your itinerary for your Alaskan vacation? ### Speaker B: Oh, I haven't really looked into that much yet, I guess I should get on that!  Any suggestions?   ### Speaker A: There is so many fun things to do if you enjoy the outdoors! I have heard the fishing and hiking is second to none in Alaska.  ### Speaker B: I'm not big on fishing, but I bet the hiking would be beautiful!  ### Speaker A: I am sure you could even get a hiking tour guide. May help you stay safe from bears or other dangers there. I love a good hike but am often concerned about the bigger animals around.  ### Speaker B: I would definitely go with a tour guide!  I'm not trying to get eaten ha I think it would be cool to see a moose though.   ### Speaker A: Good to hear, that way I know you will be safe! I would love to see a moose in person. I have heard they are larger than you would expect.  ### Speaker B: I can imagine!  I think the biggest animal I've really seen around here in person would be deer or turkey.  Not too exciting ### Speaker A: Well I am excited for this adventure for you! Are you traveling alone or are you going with friends or family? ### Speaker B: I'm traveling alone, but I'm planning on trying to meet up with a friend who lives up there for visit if our schedules work out. ### Speaker A: That would great! I am impressed, I am nervous to travel alone. I prefer having someone around I know when I am on new adventures.  ### Speaker B: I don't mind it.  And sometimes when you want to go somewhere, you just want to go, and it's hard to coordinate with others.  I'm always up for a traveling pal though ### Speaker A: Have you made plans with your friend to get together when you get to Alaska? Does your friend enjoy action movies too?  ### Speaker B: we are working on plans currently. trying to get our schedules lined up. I'm not sure if they like action movies or not.  ### Speaker A: two weeks of the great alaska. have you decided how you spend your time outdoors. ### Speaker B: lots of hiking and trying not to get eaten by mosquitoes. lol ### Speaker A: what else is alaska known for? what can visitors expect besides hiking? ### Speaker B: i'm not sure honestly.

But, yeah, I wouldn't go camping with a small baby either. ### Speaker A: You might have to go soon then and like you say just go along for the day. Your wife would probably get quite tired with all the walking and standing though. ### Speaker B: We have one that is local and I think we'll try that. And, I'll let her just sit by the stage while I get all the food and run around.  ### Speaker A: So tell me, did you and your wife end up going to your local festival? ### Speaker B: We were on the way out the door and unfortunately she suddenly had really bad morning sickness so we had to pulll out, such a bummer!  ### Speaker A: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that! Is she feeling any better? There will be other events, as long as she is ok.  ### Speaker B: It's true! Obviously her and the baby are the main priority, so I was okay with it.

I thought it was cool at first, you know, to see a raccoon unlock a door. And now, I regret it so much. I've had to change the layout of my apartment and put deadbolts on my doors so that Bandicoot can't get out. And, he is sneaky about it. One time, he unlocked the pantry and was eating some cookies!

I would hate to think what might happen if Bandicoot got into any of that.  Hey, when you drive do you lock him up in a cage or let him wander around in the car?

The lock requires a specific key, which I have hidden in my drawers. For medication, I have a small box that I also keep locked up, but it's a combination lock, so Bandicoot isn't able to get into it.

If I bought 20 tickets, all with the same numbers, and won the jackpot with three other people, instead of getting 25% of the jackpot, I'd get 20/23rds of the jackpot instead!  So that's what I did! ### Speaker A: LOL but now you only have one chance of winning! I did different numbers for all of my 50 tickets so I have 50 chances. ### Speaker B: Yeah, both strategies have their pros and cons.  But if I win I want it to be on the news.  They'll say, \"There were 23 winners of the jackpot.\"  And then people will think, \"Well that's lame.
