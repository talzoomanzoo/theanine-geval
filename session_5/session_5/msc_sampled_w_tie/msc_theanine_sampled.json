How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\nSpeaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. \nSpeaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it. \nSpeaker A: That is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks?\nSpeaker B: The only trick I was able to teach him, that I deeply regret, was how locks worked. I thought it was cool at first, you know, to see a raccoon unlock a door. And now, I regret it so much. I've had to change the layout of my apartment and put deadbolts on my doors so that Bandicoot can't get out. And, he is sneaky about it. One time, he unlocked the pantry and was eating some cookies! It's like having a toddler that never grows up.\nSpeaker A: That is bad I guess.  Do you keep all of your chemicals, poisons, and medications up and locked?  I would hate to think what might happen if Bandicoot got into any of that.  Hey, when you drive do you lock him up in a cage or let him wander around in the car?  That could be dangerous for you driving and he freaks out.\nSpeaker B: All the chemicals and poisons are in a gated lock in the basement. The lock requires a specific key, which I have hidden in my drawers. For medication, I have a small box that I also keep locked up, but it's a combination lock, so Bandicoot isn't able to get into it. For driving, I bought a harness that keeps him strapped in the back seat, he can move a bit, but mostly sturdy. I put blankets down and his favorite toys so that he stays calm. Sometimes, I'll pass small snacks to keep him occupied. I also take the side streets to work so that it's not too much for him. What about you? When you foster dogs, do you put them in a cage when you drive?\nSpeaker A: I do keep the dogs secured. You never knwo how they are going to react.  Most of them I only have for a few days, so I really do not get a chance to see how they will act in all situations.  ",

What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?  \nSpeaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere!\nSpeaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it.\nSpeaker A: I don't have recipes but I know how to make a good grilled asparagus. Are you looking to bolster your chef book?\nSpeaker B: I sure am!  Grilled asparagus does sound good.  Do you pair the grilled asparagus with your fajitas?  What do you prefer, chicken or beef fajitas?\nSpeaker A: I prefer chicken to beef. I pair it with beef fajitas andI think it's great to have with a glass of merlot. Do you like wine?\nSpeaker B: You're making me hungry!  Yes, I do love wine.  As a matter of fact, I used to live in the Bordeaux region in France, so my favorite wine is Bordeaux wine.  But I also love champagne and cognac.\nSpeaker A: Haha, I know right? I lived in the Champagne region for a bit! Always wanted to go to Bordeaux. How was it there?",
