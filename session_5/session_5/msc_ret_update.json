If I had to, I think I could muster the courage to face the animals out here, but I will happily avoid them when possible. With you around, I'd feel much better, as well. How do you feel about being that close to wildlife?",
            "Speaker B: Well I don't have a lot of experience with that but I guess I'd be ok as long as I knew what to do. Most of the wildlife I see is squirrels, pigeons, and the occasional possum. ",
            "Speaker A: We have plenty of those out here, as well, and you'll see them far more often than you'll see wolves. We will just have to take extra precautions at night and make sure we don't leave any food outside that might attract them."

        "response": "I'll definitely keep that in mind and follow your lead when it comes to wildlife safety. I trust your judgment on that. It sounds like a thrilling experience, and I'm excited to learn more about the local wildlife during my visit."

Alaska was by far my favorite, but I'm kind of a loner and it feels like a lot of people there are, so maybe I just relate. But the scenery and landscapes are unbelievably beautiful. What's your favorite place you've been to?",

In Japan, you should definitely visit the historic temples in Kyoto, explore the bustling streets of Tokyo, and immerse yourself in the rich culture by trying traditional tea ceremonies and enjoying the delicious local cuisine. Don't forget to visit some of the beautiful gardens and maybe even attend a traditional Japanese performance. You're going to have an amazing time there!"

Oh, the good old times.  If only I were this excited about my career!",

That's one of the things that excites me about the idea of becoming a chef - the opportunity to travel, learn about different cuisines, and work in various kitchens around the world.

I had trouble at first with the actor having a five oclock shadow all the time but he plays both parts really well.  I get people who don't like him cause he's not edgy but I loved the hero aspect of him.  I do love me some Deadpool though.  Ryan Reynolds is the best.",
            "Speaker A: True. I think Green Arrow trys to be like Batman. Oliver Queen is not as rich as Bruce Wayne and not as edgy, but it is a TV show after all. I agree totally about Ryan Reynolds. He has played some really great parts lately. I just saw a recent movie with him in it. I forget the name though. It wasn't a superhero movie but he played the same sort of character.",
            "Speaker B: He does play mostly the same character in his movies and I think that's him in real life too but he's so funny that I don't even care.  I just saw him the new Hitmans Bodyguards Girlfriend movie.  I think that's the title anyway.  He's also got a new one coming soon called Free Guy that I'm excited for.  It looks different than anything out there recently.",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, that was the name of the movie. The Hitman's Bodyguard. I think it's the prequel to the latest movie. I also watched 6 Underground as well. I think he's that way in real life, too. He and Huge Jackman are too funny with their sparing."
        ],
        "response": "I haven't seen 6 Underground yet, but I'll definitely check it out. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are hilarious together. I'm looking forward to Free Guy too. It does look different, and I'm excited to see Reynolds in a new light. His humor always shines through, no matter the character he plays."

Yeah I’m gradually getting better at speaking and understand spoken English, but can read the words pretty well, so I usually listen to shows or movies in English but also put on the subtitles so if I don’t understand I can read along. It really helps me learn better English by watching things on tv. ",

You will be able to pick up the Spanish language real fast. And also start by practicing how to roll your R’s that’s the hardest part of learning Spanish I think. ",

Conversing in the local language will definitely enhance your travel experience there. Just keep practicing and you'll see improvement in no time."

            "Speaker A: The Kindle is OK, I like it but still will take a good old book over a digital one.  I did not get any new books for it yet.  The grandkids bought me 4 books with the Kindle.  I am still on my second one.  Did you get your apartment set up?  You could probably play your audio books over the stereo and hear them in every room!  That would be cool.",
            "Speaker B: I have set up, thank you for asking. I have a google home speaker in each room, so it's great to eat dinner and just listen to a audio book. Or, when I'm working on the computer, I will have it play in the background. Some audio books I didn't like because of the voice. It's need to be a soothing voice, don't care if it's male or female. You are still reading the Trevor Noah memoir? It was good, but it seemed to fast of a read for me.",
            "Speaker A: I finished it, it was OK.  Very weird that he has a memoir.  I mean, he is just a young person compared to me.  Maybe there will memoirs part I, part 2, and so on from him.  If he does this it is kind of an interesting idea.",
            "Speaker B: Well, wisdom doesn't come with age, it comes with experience. I have written a few memoirs when I was young, and a lot of people said they related to it. The older generation can see themselves, and the younger generation can make sure not to repeat history. I hope he writes more. It would be interesting to see how his thoughts may change in the future.",
            "Speaker A: What?  You wrote a few memoirs of your own?  Did you do enough things to complete more than one memoir?  Your tax accountant work must be very interesting!",
            "Speaker B: My memoirs were centered around my childhood and my mother's passing. I took a few classes on writing memoirs, and my teacher help me compose a book. My friends and family have bought copies of them, and I've read at some college book clubs. Just because I am a tax accountant doesn't mean I had a mundane life. Memoirs can be about anything in your life. I've read some that I could relate to, and I've read some that taught me new cultures. I recommend reading some made by the generations younger than you. It might give you a new perspective on the younger crowd.",
            "Speaker A: That is interesting.  I guess these memoirs can act as some sort of therapy.  I always think there are many variations on each persons life, but fundamentally most all of us do go through some very similar events.  I agree that we all can learn form one another, but at some point if you focus too much on reading about others you just do not live your own life to it's fullest.",
            "Speaker B: I would have to disagree on that. Every one experiences life different. No two events are the same, and the emotions we experience from the events are the same. Too see a different perspective or something to relate to. To read about the past to make sure you don't make the same mistakes in the future. To catch a glimpse into someones personal life is interesting, because we may have done something different. Reading how other people coped with the loss of their mother helped me cope with my own experiences of losing my mother. Not everyone wants to live their life to the fullest, especially because that can mean something different for each person. You should try writing a memoir! It can give your grandchildren a fresh perspective of what your life in the past was like and what changed over time with history. It's a way to connect with people and get closer, and hopefully, a better understanding of each other.",
            "Speaker A: Perhaps I will write one.  I just think many aspects of our lives are very similar.  We each do have unique experiences but we also have experiences that are close to or the same.  Have you ever wondered what this ratio might look like?  Very different life experiences to similar experiences?  Many times it how the person reacts and handles the experience instead of the actual experience itself. "
        ],
        "response": "That's a fascinating thought. The balance between unique and similar life experiences is indeed intriguing. I believe it's the individual's reaction and handling of those experiences that truly shape their narrative. It's the diverse reactions that make each memoir special and worth exploring. Writing your own memoir could be a great way to reflect on those moments and share a piece of yourself with your grandchildren. It's a way to bridge the gap between generations and create a deeper connection through understanding."

It's rather inexpensive, and it's filled with cultural treasures from not only China, but other Asian countries as well. There is another the gorgeous Chinese decorations and giant gate that welcomes you in. It's really a sight to behold.",
