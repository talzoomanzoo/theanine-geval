Since you live in Portugal, I'd love to stop by for a visit if you're free this coming month.  I've always wanted to visit Lisbon.  It has the world's longest bridge!\nSpeaker B: That'a great idea. We have a holiday house just outside of Lisbon. You are welcome to lodge with us.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great!  I'm already very excited about my trip to Spain, and now I get to visit you in Lisbon!
