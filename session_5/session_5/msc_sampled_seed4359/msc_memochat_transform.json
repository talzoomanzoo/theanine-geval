Have  you got to spend time with your kids? ### Speaker A: Work has kept me away from them more than I would like, unfortunately.  ### Speaker B: That is unfortunate but I know how that goes. My mom was a libraian, so she was always busy helping people ### Speaker A: It is a taxing job, but very rewarding. ### Speaker B: Most definitely, I think the rewards ulitmately make it worth it, plus your kids can get any book they want! ### Speaker A: That is a huge perk! Kids don't read enough these days.  ### Speaker B: I know! I feel like most kids would struggle even finding a book in a library, internet has made it easy for them! ### Speaker A: No kidding. Things sure have changed over the years. ### Speaker B: I know! I can't remember the last time my grandkids asked to go to the libary. ### Speaker A: Have you ever thought about taking your grandkids to a library and explaining what your mom did for a living as a librarian? It could be a great learning field trip for them.  ### Speaker B: Kids just don't seem to be interested in going to the library anymore. ### Speaker A: I agree, I see libraries closing more and more. Even school libraries are half the size they use to be. ### Speaker B: I'm not really sure of a solution to keep libraries open. With the rise of the internet people do not need them as much as I used to. ### Speaker A: That is basically it. Everything is becoming electronic. Paper books are not really needed, only people who cherish a real book keep them relevant. ### Speaker B: I do find it interesting that libraries now are finding creative ways to still stay relevant like creating little maker spaces.  Some are adding 3D printers and other tools to keep kids learning and entertained in a safe environment ### Speaker A: Yes we implement those in our library. We still get parents bringing in their little kids which I find encouraging ### Speaker B: Not only will the kids learn but the parents will also learn new skills to ### Speaker A: even librarians like me learn new skills too, lol ### Speaker B: That's true you're never too old to learn a new skill ### Speaker A: :), so how was the trip to the park with your grandkids? ### Speaker B: It was great the weather was really nice and I really enjoyed getting outside and getting some fresh air ### Speaker A: My youngest child just asked me if I could teach them how to play the flute! ### Speaker B: Oh really? So they want to play the flute like you. That's wonderful to hear. Are you planning to teach them yourself or hire a teacher? ### Speaker A: I am going to teach them myself. I am just so proud that they came to me and asked for my help. It was nice to feel wanted by my kids.  ### Speaker B: I bet is a wonderful feeling. I took my grandkids fishing once because they asked me to. It's a great way to bond with them. Now you and your youngest can bond through music. I think that's wonderful. ### Speaker A: Yes, I am so glad we can spend some time together and bond over flutes. She wants to learn because of the singer Lizzo. She can play the flute so well that it inspired her. Have you heard of her? ### Speaker B: Ah no I have not. I'm sure one of my grandkids have. Are they very famous? I'm a bit out of touch with music these days. ### Speaker A: Yes she is famous. Me too. I am a bit out of touch too with the latest music. My daughter played the video of her playing the flute and singing. It was incredible. I am glad she found a motivation though. Can any of your kids play an instrument? ### Speaker B: No not my kids or grandkids. They spend so much time on their phones and tablets that they rarely take interest in such things. It would be wonderful if one of them did take an interest in music. Is your youngest the only one interested in musical intrustments right now? ### Speaker A: Yes at the moment. My other two are just like yours - addicted to tablets and phones. I hoping that when I start teaching my youngest the flute the others would want to join in. I will grab a few spare just in case. Did you ever take your kids fishing? Did they like it? ### Speaker B: They sure did. Even though the oldest girl was so busy with her texting and what not.

Should I hire someone? ### \n\n``` Speaker B Input:\nRecent Dialogs: Speaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends? ###Speaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do. ###Speaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars. ###Speaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there,  ###Speaker A: You'd have to get some serious blackout curtains for when it was daylight lol! You'll have to stock up on some warm essentials before heading out. You definitely don't want to get stuck in a bad situation in the cold, especially if you're alone. I bet they have great ice cream! You'll have to tell me about it when you get back! ###Speaker B: Yeah, I need to call my friend and find out what season they are in so I can pack accordingly. I will take pictures of the ice cream too so I can tell you about it. I wonder if there are a lot of bears there? I don't like bears either. ###Speaker A: I'm pretty sure they have grizzlies up there. You better pack something to fend them off too just in case. I bet your friend knows everything you'd need to keep them away. ###Speaker B: I will bring whatever they let me bring on the airplane, but I am really counting on my friend to help me out with the local customs lol. Do you know if Rocky and Bullwinkle were from Alaska?  ###Speaker A: No, they were from Minnesota. Are you going to have your friend be your hiking guide? ###Speaker B: I invited my friend to come stay at the lodge where I'm vacationing and he said it would be fun to get away for a bit. So I'm hoping he will show me around for a week or so. I might have to hire a hiking guide, it depends on how much he knows about hiking and grizzlies I think. What do you think?

How do you come up with the plot to your movies? ### Speaker B: We have a lot of weird, creative conversations. We always have in my family. We used to write parts of stories and then swap them half-way through so that the other person could take over the story and add different creative elements to it. That's honestly how we still come up with some of our ideas. ### Speaker A: That's terrific!  Have you seen any good horror movies recently?  Personally, I prefer the classics like Halloween or Friday the 13th. ### Speaker B: Yes, we watch a lot of horror movies in our family. Our favorite right now is the Conjuring series of films and their spin-offs. The newest one just came out and it was ok. Have you seen any horror movies lately? ### Speaker A: Yes, but just the classics like I mentioned.  I'm not too keen on the modern ones, they just don't make them like they used to.
