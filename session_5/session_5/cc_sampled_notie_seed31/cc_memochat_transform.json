It's important to stay physically and mentally fit, especially with this new job. ###Co-workers B: Just don't let your anger get the better of you again. Remember when you exploded and started throwing things? ###Co-workers A: Ugh, let's not even go there. My parents gave me a good scolding for that. ###Co-workers B: Well, all that matters is that you learn from your mistakes and keep moving forward. And hey, you're doing just that with this promotion. ###Co-workers A: Absolutely. Thanks for always being a supportive colleague, it means a lot to me. ### \n\n``` Co-workers A Input:",
