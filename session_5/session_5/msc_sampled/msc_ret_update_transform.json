I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there, \nSpeaker A: You'd have to get some serious blackout curtains for when it was daylight lol! You'll have to stock up on some warm essentials before heading out. You definitely don't want to get stuck in a bad situation in the cold, especially if you're alone. I bet they have great ice cream! You'll have to tell me about it when you get back!\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I need to call my friend and find out what season they are in so I can pack accordingly. I will take pictures of the ice cream too so I can tell you about it. I wonder if there are a lot of bears there? I don't like bears either.\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty sure they have grizzlies up there. You better pack something to fend them off too just in case. I bet your friend knows everything you'd need to keep them away.\nSpeaker B: I will bring whatever they let me bring on the airplane, but I am really counting on my friend to help me out with the local customs lol. Do you know if Rocky and Bullwinkle were from Alaska? \nSpeaker A: No, they were from Minnesota. Are you going to have your friend be your hiking guide?\nSpeaker B: I invited my friend to come stay at the lodge where I'm vacationing and he said it would be fun to get away for a bit. So I'm hoping he will show me around for a week or so. I might have to hire a hiking guide, it depends on how much he knows about hiking and grizzlies I think. What do you think? Should I hire someone?\nSpeaker A: I think it could be a good idea, especially with all the large animals in Alaska and the terrain. I wouldn't rely on your friend and have someone more professional that knows a lot just in case.

I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. \nSpeaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it. \nSpeaker A: That is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks?\nSpeaker B: The only trick I was able to teach him, that I deeply regret, was how locks worked. I thought it was cool at first, you know, to see a raccoon unlock a door. And now, I regret it so much. I've had to change the layout of my apartment and put deadbolts on my doors so that Bandicoot can't get out. And, he is sneaky about it. One time, he unlocked the pantry and was eating some cookies! It's like having a toddler that never grows up.\nSpeaker A: That is bad I guess.  Do you keep all of your chemicals, poisons, and medications up and locked?  I would hate to think what might happen if Bandicoot got into any of that.  Hey, when you drive do you lock him up in a cage or let him wander around in the car?  That could be dangerous for you driving and he freaks out.\nSpeaker B: All the chemicals and poisons are in a gated lock in the basement. The lock requires a specific key, which I have hidden in my drawers. For medication, I have a small box that I also keep locked up, but it's a combination lock, so Bandicoot isn't able to get into it. For driving, I bought a harness that keeps him strapped in the back seat, he can move a bit, but mostly sturdy. I put blankets down and his favorite toys so that he stays calm. Sometimes, I'll pass small snacks to keep him occupied. I also take the side streets to work so that it's not too much for him. What about you? When you foster dogs, do you put them in a cage when you drive?\nSpeaker A: I do keep the dogs secured. You never knwo how they are going to react.  Most of them I only have for a few days, so I really do not get a chance to see how they will act in all situations.  \nSpeaker B: Oh, does that make you want to adopt a dog?

This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now!\nSpeaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her?\nSpeaker A: I think so.  She seems like a very sweet girl and she seems to care deeply about my son, so that's what matters most.  You know, maybe I can stop by and visit you as well, since you live in Europe.  France, Spain, Italy?  Where are you living now?\nSpeaker B: Bless her, that's good to hear. That would be great! I live in Portugal. It's not too far from Spain. We can always arrange something. How long would you be there for?\nSpeaker A: I'm planning to stay in Spain for three weeks.
