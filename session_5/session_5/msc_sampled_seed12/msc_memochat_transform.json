Even school libraries are half the size they use to be. ### Speaker B: I'm not really sure of a solution to keep libraries open. With the rise of the internet people do not need them as much as I used to. ### Speaker A: That is basically it. Everything is becoming electronic.

I think that's wonderful. ### Speaker A: Yes, I am so glad we can spend some time together and bond over flutes. She wants to learn because of the singer Lizzo. She can play the flute so well that it inspired her. Have you heard of her? ### Speaker B: Ah no I have not. I'm sure one of my grandkids have. Are they very famous?

I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens. ###Speaker B: hehe you're right. But i can't explain that why I am not a cat person to you sorry. How's the weather like today, still good weather to have iced tea out there? ###Speaker A: It's beautiful. I'm sitting outside while the Spice Girls are chasing bugs in the grass. What did your kids name your cats? ###Speaker B: ohh so nice sounds like you are enjoying the weather. Still we are discussing about that. Did not name them yet. Also I want to put them back since I am not a big fan of cat ###Speaker A: That would be cruel to do.
