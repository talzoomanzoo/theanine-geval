I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat? \nSpeaker A: I've thought of a lot of  names, but in the end it will probably depend on the breed and the sex.  \nSpeaker B: That's true. Is pilates hard? I've always wanted to try it but I don't know if it will be too difficult.\nSpeaker A: No, I don't think it's hard.  I actually enjoy it.  It's more fun than work, at least to me. You should give it a try!\nSpeaker B: Maybe I will. Do you think I can start at home by watching Youtube videos, or do I need to go to a Pilates class?\nSpeaker A: You can probably start with Youtube just to see if you like it.  Much better to go to a class I think though.  Of course, I'm biased. I'm in love with my instructor! haha\nSpeaker B: Lol, okay I will definitely try it at home first. If I can get the hang of it, I will sign up for a class. Hopefully I can get an instructor as good as yours lol! \nSpeaker A: Well, getting some individual responses to questions and individual attention at times, I think makes a difference.

I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks.

You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus!\nSpeaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing?\nSpeaker A: Yea, I think for the more complicated origami it's kind of a use it or lose it but for the simple stuff you can usually take a couple months of and still remember to do it! Did you see origami in Japan?\nSpeaker B: Not up close, but I noticed a lot in shop windows in certain areas. I love Japan -- they're so welcoming. One of our acquaintances GAVE me a kimono. She said it's customary to try to share their culture. Kind of different from America in my opinion.  \nSpeaker A: Oh, that sounds wonderful. It's impressive how much things that came from there and how giving a culture they are. America is definetly a lot different from them, have you visted different states in America?\nSpeaker B: Oh yes. I live in North Carolina, but I've been to almost every state. Alaska was by far my favorite, but I'm kind of a loner and it feels like a lot of people there are, so maybe I just relate. But the scenery and landscapes are unbelievably beautiful.

I kinda think it may be a little to violent for kids, but I would just allow it to each parent to decide I would probably let my grandkids watch. What is your opinion? \nSpeaker B: I agree with you. As long as the parent can explain what's going on regarding the violence, and make sure the kid knows it is just a movie and not real life, I think most kids would be able to watch the movie without really being harmed or negatively influenced.\nSpeaker A: Yes exactly.
