I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat? \nSpeaker A: I've thought of a lot of  names, but in the end it will probably depend on the breed and the sex.  \nSpeaker B: That's true. Is pilates hard? I've always wanted to try it but I don't know if it will be too difficult.\nSpeaker A: No, I don't think it's hard.  I actually enjoy it.  It's more fun than work, at least to me. You should give it a try!\nSpeaker B: Maybe I will. Do you think I can start at home by watching Youtube videos, or do I need to go to a Pilates class?\nSpeaker A: You can probably start with Youtube just to see if you like it.  Much better to go to a class I think though.  Of course, I'm biased. I'm in love with my instructor! haha\nSpeaker B: Lol, okay I will definitely try it at home first. If I can get the hang of it, I will sign up for a class. Hopefully I can get an instructor as good as yours lol! \nSpeaker A: Well, getting some individual responses to questions and individual attention at times, I think makes a difference. But there is nothing wrong with going to youtube first!  I did!",

As long as the parent can explain what's going on regarding the violence, and make sure the kid knows it is just a movie and not real life, I think most kids would be able to watch the movie without really being harmed or negatively influenced.\nSpeaker A: Yes exactly.
