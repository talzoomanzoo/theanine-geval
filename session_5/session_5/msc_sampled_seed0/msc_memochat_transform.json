I am not too scared to go this time.  Have you invented any flying things? ### Speaker A: Squirrels! When I was a kid bouncing on a trampoline, a squirrel jumped down from the tree it was on and landed on the trampoline. Due to my super energetic jumping, he flew for a moment! I guess that's not really an \"invention\" though. Do you ever invent things with your programming experience? ### Speaker B: LOL!  You had me going there for a minute.  I could just see that sucker flying in my mind.  \"Hey Bullwinkle, where's Rocky....\"  LOL  Good one!  I am really good at coding and automating systems, but I haven't really made my own thing. ### Speaker A: I see. I forgot about Rocky and Bullwinkle. That used to be my favorite cartoon. I even watched the live action movies. Thanks for the throwback! I think you just teleported me to my childhood bedroom. I appreciate the free ride down memory lane! I wish I could pay you back with a free plane ticket. ### Speaker B: It's ok!  You gave me the biggest laugh today so I think we are even!  Not to say a free plane ticket wouldn't be nice, but you might just set me on a trampoline and send me flying too! ### Speaker A: That I can do! I'm not sure the squirrel would recommend that method of transportation though, but as long as you sign some liability paperwork before hand, I am good to go! ### Speaker B: Wheeee!  I'm just being so silly now.

I have heard the fishing and hiking is second to none in Alaska.  ### Speaker B: I'm not big on fishing, but I bet the hiking would be beautiful!  ### Speaker A: I am sure you could even get a hiking tour guide. May help you stay safe from bears or other dangers there. I love a good hike but am often concerned about the bigger animals around.  ### Speaker B: I would definitely go with a tour guide!  I'm not trying to get eaten ha I think it would be cool to see a moose though.   ### Speaker A: Good to hear, that way I know you will be safe! I would love to see a moose in person. I have heard they are larger than you would expect.  ### Speaker B: I can imagine!  I think the biggest animal I've really seen around here in person would be deer or turkey.  Not too exciting ### Speaker A: Well I am excited for this adventure for you! Are you traveling alone or are you going with friends or family? ### Speaker B: I'm traveling alone, but I'm planning on trying to meet up with a friend who lives up there for visit if our schedules work out. ### Speaker A: That would great! I am impressed, I am nervous to travel alone. I prefer having someone around I know when I am on new adventures.  ### Speaker B: I don't mind it.  And sometimes when you want to go somewhere, you just want to go, and it's hard to coordinate with others.  I'm always up for a traveling pal though ### Speaker A: Have you made plans with your friend to get together when you get to Alaska?

How're you scoring these days? ### Speaker A: Right! It definitely feels like I'm on a hot streak. Hopefully it keeps up through the tournament. One of our other players is injured, though. Did you ever play sports? ### Speaker B: I played intramural soccer in college. Nowadays I mainly just watch it. I like Manchester United, they're my favorite team. Do you like a particular US or FIFA team? ### Speaker A: I love Arsenal, even though they aren't doing so well lately. I can't wait for the season to start up again. I do enjoy watching the international teams in the meantime. Having the tournaments on is so fun!' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? ###Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position.  ###Speaker A: Exciting when it really counts though!

I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living. ###Speaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime? ###Speaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play. ###Speaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with. ### \n\n``` Speaker B Input:\nRecent Dialogs: Speaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? ###Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position.  ###Speaker A: Exciting when it really counts though!

Our favorite right now is the Conjuring series of films and their spin-offs. The newest one just came out and it was ok.
