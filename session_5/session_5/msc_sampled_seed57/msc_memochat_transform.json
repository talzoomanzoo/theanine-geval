I'll keep working on a teleport machine. For now, you'll have to get there with more traditional means. So, airplane it is? Have you ever been on a flight before. ### Speaker B: I have been on it a couple times.  My mother said it was powered by pixie dust and I believed her for the longest time!  I am not too scared to go this time.  Have you invented any flying things? ### Speaker A: Squirrels! When I was a kid bouncing on a trampoline, a squirrel jumped down from the tree it was on and landed on the trampoline. Due to my super energetic jumping, he flew for a moment! I guess that's not really an \"invention\" though. Do you ever invent things with your programming experience? ### Speaker B: LOL!  You had me going there for a minute.  I could just see that sucker flying in my mind.  \"Hey Bullwinkle, where's Rocky....\"  LOL  Good one!  I am really good at coding and automating systems, but I haven't really made my own thing. ### Speaker A: I see. I forgot about Rocky and Bullwinkle. That used to be my favorite cartoon. I even watched the live action movies. Thanks for the throwback! I think you just teleported me to my childhood bedroom. I appreciate the free ride down memory lane! I wish I could pay you back with a free plane ticket. ### Speaker B: It's ok!  You gave me the biggest laugh today so I think we are even!  Not to say a free plane ticket wouldn't be nice, but you might just set me on a trampoline and send me flying too! ### Speaker A: That I can do! I'm not sure the squirrel would recommend that method of transportation though, but as long as you sign some liability paperwork before hand, I am good to go! ### Speaker B: Wheeee!  I'm just being so silly now.  Who needs a therapist when we can keep each other so happy? ### Speaker A: What is on your itinerary for your Alaskan vacation? ### Speaker B: Oh, I haven't really looked into that much yet, I guess I should get on that!  Any suggestions?   ### Speaker A: There is so many fun things to do if you enjoy the outdoors! I have heard the fishing and hiking is second to none in Alaska.  ### Speaker B: I'm not big on fishing, but I bet the hiking would be beautiful!  ### Speaker A: I am sure you could even get a hiking tour guide. May help you stay safe from bears or other dangers there. I love a good hike but am often concerned about the bigger animals around.  ### Speaker B: I would definitely go with a tour guide!  I'm not trying to get eaten ha I think it would be cool to see a moose though.   ### Speaker A: Good to hear, that way I know you will be safe! I would love to see a moose in person. I have heard they are larger than you would expect.  ### Speaker B: I can imagine!  I think the biggest animal I've really seen around here in person would be deer or turkey.  Not too exciting ### Speaker A: Well I am excited for this adventure for you! Are you traveling alone or are you going with friends or family? ### Speaker B: I'm traveling alone, but I'm planning on trying to meet up with a friend who lives up there for visit if our schedules work out. ### Speaker A: That would great! I am impressed, I am nervous to travel alone. I prefer having someone around I know when I am on new adventures.  ### Speaker B: I don't mind it.  And sometimes when you want to go somewhere, you just want to go, and it's hard to coordinate with others.  I'm always up for a traveling pal though ### Speaker A: Have you made plans with your friend to get together when you get to Alaska? Does your friend enjoy action movies too?  ### Speaker B: we are working on plans currently. trying to get our schedules lined up. I'm not sure if they like action movies or not.  ### Speaker A: two weeks of the great alaska. have you decided how you spend your time outdoors. ### Speaker B: lots of hiking and trying not to get eaten by mosquitoes. lol ### Speaker A: what else is alaska known for? what can visitors expect besides hiking? ### Speaker B: i'm not sure honestly. I'll have to ask my friend what else there is to do. lol' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends? ###Speaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do. ###Speaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see.

Right now I am really getting into the weeds of World War II. There's so much to unpack. ###Speaker A: For sure! So much happened and it really affected how the world is today. I like learning about the history of places where I have lived, it's really interesting. ###Speaker B: That sounds really cool! What have you learned about where you currently live? ###Speaker A: Oh, I found out that the big sports field used to be a farm where they grew wheat and raised cows!

I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested. ###Speaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round. ###Speaker A: I would definitely recommend looking for a rental car to have on hand. There is a town within walking distance from me, but it can be dangerous to walk with the wolves and elk around, especially at night. ###Speaker B: I imagine so!!! I wouldn't want to run into a wolf! Ok. I will add car rental to my plans. Do you get scared with your dogs, that you will run into wildilfe like that? ###Speaker A: I think I'm more afraid of the wildlife than my dogs are. If I had to, I think I could muster the courage to face the animals out here, but I will happily avoid them when possible. With you around, I'd feel much better, as well. How do you feel about being that close to wildlife? ###Speaker B: Well I don't have a lot of experience with that but I guess I'd be ok as long as I knew what to do.

If that works for you.... it\u2019ll be a blast woof woof! ### Speaker A: Do you think my pet raccoon and your dogs should have a play date? ### Speaker B: I think that would be fantastic! I want them to meet! ### Speaker A: I bet they would have so much fun together.  I wonder if my raccoon would be afraid of your dogs though?  We would have to keep everybody on a leash until we see that they get along. ### Speaker B: Oh maybe! My terriers are quite elderly so theyre very mellow if that helps ### Speaker A: Yes, being older dogs will be much better.  I know some of those younger terriers can have quite a lot of energy.  How goes the job hunt? Have you had any offers yet? ### Speaker B: It's going okay. I'm not really in a rush because I'm planning on leaving my part-time and having a small break between starting a new one ### Speaker A: I would love to take some time off.  I've been working at my job for almost 10 years now, and I've only taken 3 vacations in that whole time.  Do you think you'll take a cruise if you take some time off?' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! ###Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food? ###Speaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too? ###Speaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out!

Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals. ###Speaker B: Yea, that totally makes sense! I just wanted time off to spend with the dogs and look for a better job elsewhere, I'm hoping that I'll be able to get a job outside of a warehouse! ###Speaker A: That is understandable. I didn't always think I would end up a zookeeper. Do you have anything in mind? ###Speaker B: Well, I really enjoy animals so I might think of applying to work in a zoo aswell! Is it a super busy job? ###Speaker A: That sounds like a great idea! You would be surprised how busy it can be. Not every job is high demanding and you don't have to work with all the animals either.

Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you? ###Speaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses. ###Speaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set? ###Speaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up. ###Speaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe? ###Speaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood. ###Speaker A: Chemicals!  Do the actors hate working with it then?  I can imagine they are a pretty high maintenance bunch.

Like you said, there's a wide availability of products, and on a mom schedule, sometimes I need to do my shopping very late. It's mostly just convenient to live in the city, but I appreciate what the country has to offer too. Do you think you'd like a city at all? ### Speaker A: I used to live in a suburb of DC and I liked some things. I agree, I miss stores and restaurants being open all night. In the small town in the country, there is not much in the way of culture and I miss that. Everything closes on Sunday and town is done at maybe 8pm.  ### Speaker B: Yeah, once you have convenience it's hard to go back.

I don't miss the traffic at all. Around DC, it was so bad and it took an hour to go what was a 20 minute trip anywhere else. I love the peace out here. Our town is famous for Silver Queen Sweet Corn. I can travel to the city when I want and live out here though. That's not bad.
