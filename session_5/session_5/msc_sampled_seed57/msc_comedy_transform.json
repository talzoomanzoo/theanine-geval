What do you think?\nSpeaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus!\nSpeaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing?\nSpeaker A: Yea, I think for the more complicated origami it's kind of a use it or lose it but for the simple stuff you can usually take a couple months of and still remember to do it!

There were lots of bears and huge moose!\nSpeaker A: Wow, that sounds like such an adventure! I love to visit Canada. I have seen moose but never a bear! That must have been scary!\nSpeaker B: Yes, it is quite scary. We could also hear the wolves howling at night, luckily we didn't come across them though. One thing to note about bears, is they just want to come and scrounge for our food, so we learned to safely pack it away and hang it up high in a tree.\nSpeaker A: Yes, I've heard that it's important to be careful in bear country! I would love to see one in person though. Do you take lots of photos on your trips?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I took quite a few. The scenery was stunning. Would you like me to send you some photos?

Hopefully your trip to the art museum is much better than that. Did your boyfriend go to Disney World too?",

Maybe it's because they're more independent and have their own unique personalities. Plus, I've heard that having a cat can be relaxing after a long day at work. But hey, maybe I should try volunteering at an animal shelter and see if puppies can win me over! And speaking of trying new things, have you ever grilled Mexican food? I heard it's delicious!",
