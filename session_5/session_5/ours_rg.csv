Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?
Speaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?
Speaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?
Speaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading ""The Gettysburg Campaign""'
Speaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.
Speaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? ","That's understandable. Speaking of your nephew, with him turning 14 soon, do you have any special plans or gift ideas in mind for his birthday?"

Speaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.
Speaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.
Speaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.
Speaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!
Speaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor?
Speaker B: Yes, more ice cream is always good, haha! I like a good rocky road, or pretty much any chocolate ice cream with nuts or stir-ins! I like most of Jeni's brand too. How about you? What is your favorite kind?
Speaker A: I am a big fan of cookie dough ice cream, and I love cheesecake flavored ice creams too! Ben & Jerry has some that I like, but I prefer to get ice cream from an ice cream shop.  It's just something about being in that environment,
Speaker B: Yes, ice cream shops are the best! They have stir-ins, and the smells are heavenly! Ben and Jerry's used to have a blueberry cheesecake that was amazing! I have only had that and their strawberry flavors. Both were great!

Speaker B: Cats can be nice! I used to have cats, but am allergic to them and had to give them to my friend. I have an Australian Kelpie who is a rescue. She is very energetic and smart!
Speaker A: I had cats as a child and I think that they're a bit easier to care for than dogs, especially in the city. I am a dog lover as well though; Australian Kelpies are gorgeous! What is her name? Does she walk well off-leash?
Speaker B: Yes, cats are very smart and clean. Mine used to bring me a mouse to throw for her, just like a dog! And if you have 2 cats, they play with each other! Mine would run up and down the halls in the middle of the night, haha. Her name is Kyrie, and she walks off leash and is very obedient. Dogs might be hard to keep in your small apartment though, since Kyrie likes to play in the field, run with cars along the fence row, and herd goats.

Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there, 
Speaker A: You'd have to get some serious blackout curtains for when it was daylight lol! You'll have to stock up on some warm essentials before heading out.

Speaker B: I invited my friend to come stay at the lodge where I'm vacationing and he said it would be fun to get away for a bit. So I'm hoping he will show me around for a week or so. I might have to hire a hiking guide, it depends on how much he knows about hiking and grizzlies I think. What do you think? Should I hire someone?","It's great that your friend is joining you at the lodge! Having a local guide can definitely enhance your Alaska experience, especially when it comes to safety in the wilderness. However, if you're unsure about their expertise in hiking and dealing with grizzlies, it might be a good idea to hire a professional guide just to be safe.

Speaker A: I like to go hiking in the local trails here. I am familiar with them and there's so many routes that I can take. Sadly, the bugs are as bad here as they are anywhere else.....
Speaker B: They can't be that bad in the fall right? I hope? Do you camp most every weekend?
Speaker A: A least a couple of times a month. Sometimes, yeah, I go every weekend to relax. Being in nature is so relaxing to me. And nah the bugs aren't too bad in the fall and winter. There's a beautiful river along one trail that I bet you'd love to see. 
Speaker B: That sounds like it would be relaxing. I would probable be okay if we didn't run into any wolves, bears etc. Have you ever came across any predators when you were camping?","Luckily, I haven't encountered any predators like wolves or bears during my camping trips. Most wild animals tend to avoid humans, especially in well-traveled areas. It's always important to be cautious and follow safety guidelines, but in my experience, it's rare to come across such predators while camping."

Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?
Speaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.
Speaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?
Speaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.
Speaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?
Speaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood.
Speaker A: Chemicals!  Do the actors hate working with it then?  I can imagine they are a pretty high maintenance bunch.  Do they worry about the blood messing with their looks?
Speaker B: Our actors are pretty amateur.  No big name ones so they are really good to work with.  Hey, how about you?  How is your interview practice going?  I am pretty sure you be excellent during it!","Thanks for asking! My interview practice is going well. It's a bit like casting for a horror movie - looking for the right fit and chemistry to bring the story to life.

Speaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?

Speaker B: I would love to get back to Italy but need to save up and the hopeful priority is to Greece this year.  You have friends in Europe are you in contact to see what plans you can make?
Speaker A: Yes I've been talking to them quite a bit so they know what's going on. I'll be staying with some of them while I'm over there. I have never been to Greece....I'd like to go though. Maybe I'll add it to my itinerary! Maybe we could plan to be in Greece at the same time?!
Speaker B: That would be so good.  There is so much history and the roman statues i take my daughter to see in the museums and through our local resources is fab.  She is building up the passion which is lovely to see.  Have you still got your hair blue or has it grown out now?
Speaker A: That's awesome! Maybe you can teach me a little about all the mythology. I think I've never liked it before only because I didn't understand it. My hair is back to being its natural brown - lol I'm being boring for the moment.
Speaker B: Never boring you will keep styling it all sorts of interesting styles im sure.  Yes i would be lovely to be your guide for the day out in Greece.  Bring some decent walking boots and some sun cream, its a different heat out there but your tan is probably topped up with going to the beach each day.
Speaker A: That's good advice! Thank you! I saw on the news Cali has been getting a lot of rain. Have you still been able to run on the beach each day?","I've been able to keep up with my beach runs, feeling almost superhuman with the wind in my hair and the waves crashing beside me. It's invigorating!"

Speaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?
Speaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?
Speaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.","That's a great idea! Since you have fresh eggs from your farm, incorporating them into the shrimp fried rice would make it even more delicious and special."

I find that you do healing very fascinating!","That's interesting!

Speaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them
Speaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued. 
Speaker B: Well if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get 
Speaker A: Wow! Ok! This is sounding like a bigger undertaking! Should I embrace bugs in the home if they help the plants or am I getting wild?
Speaker B: Well from my experince bugs do the complete opposite and don't help at all, so avoid that at all costs! Fertilizers are the way to go to help with growth.
Speaker A: Oh man. I have lots to learn. What is the lifespan of a plum tree?
Speaker B: around 10 to 15 years but if you take care of them I'm sure you could get 20 out of it.
Speaker A: Now we are also talking commitment! This is not how I expected my day to go! I am excited, yet so nervous! 
Speaker B: It doesn't take too much time to do per day so after school give it a little water and that should keep them in great way. Speaking off school how are you getting on?",I'm slowly getting the hang of it! Thanks for the advice on taking care of the plants. It seems like a manageable routine to water them daily after school. Your tips are really helping me feel more confident about this garden project.

Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment. 
Speaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon?
Speaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think?
Speaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus!
Speaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing?
Speaker A: Yea, I think for the more complicated origami it's kind of a use it or lose it but for the simple stuff you can usually take a couple months of and still remember to do it! Did you see origami in Japan?
Speaker B: Not up close, but I noticed a lot in shop windows in certain areas. I love Japan -- they're so welcoming. One of our acquaintances GAVE me a kimono. She said it's customary to try to share their culture. Kind of different from America in my opinion.  
Speaker A: Oh, that sounds wonderful. It's impressive how much things that came from there and how giving a culture they are. America is definetly a lot different from them, have you visted different states in America?
Speaker B: Oh yes. I live in North Carolina, but I've been to almost every state. Alaska was by far my favorite, but I'm kind of a loner and it feels like a lot of people there are, so maybe I just relate. But the scenery and landscapes are unbelievably beautiful. What's your favorite place you've been to?
Speaker A: I just visited Italy recently, it was much better than I had first anticipated, similar to Alaska with all the landscapes and scenery! Now I'm planning to go to Japan, do you have any recommendations on what to do there?","You should definitely consider visiting the beautiful gardens in Japan.

Speaker B: There is a horror genre movie that was released just this week which I'm going to watch tonight. It is called ""Girl Next.""

Speaker B: My Film Studies professor job has been going absolutely great lately. I love all my students, because they really get into the lectures and ask lots of questions. Yes, my job requires me to watch movies all the time, so that is how I find the best ones. Is your programmer job going all right lately?
Speaker A: That sounds amazing. Super lucky to have students that really enjoy what they are learning about and I’m sure that’s down to the way you teach and what you teach them. I’m so glad it is all going well for you. Yeah it is going much better now, I’m really getting in the swing of things thank you for asking. 
Speaker B: You're welcome. So, returning to the subject of Pulp Fiction, did you think it was funny? Did you think it was too violent for kids to watch?","I found Pulp Fiction to be quite entertaining and intriguing. The dialogue and characters were captivating. As for the violence, I can see why you might wonder about its appropriateness for kids. It definitely has some intense scenes that may not be suitable for younger audiences."

Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.
Speaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general?
Speaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts.
Speaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts?
Speaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.  Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately?",It's great that you're passing on your grandmother's jello recipe to your kids.

Speaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there!
Speaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo?
Speaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people.
Speaker A: That sounds awesome.  I haven't been to the zoo in so long.  I wish I could go.
Speaker B: You should go with your sister! she can bring her dog. They probably have all kinds of exotic birds...",That's a great idea! I should definitely plan a trip to the zoo with my sister and her yellow lab. It would be wonderful to see the exotic birds together. Thanks for the suggestion!
"Speaker A loves the show Friends and enjoys visiting graffiti-filled places.
Speaker A and Speaker B have a conversation about their personal interests and trips they have taken for work.","Speaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think?
Speaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons
Speaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use.
Speaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful?
Speaker A: Most of them were not.  It really depends on where on your body you get them.  Most of mine are on areas that didn't hurt.  The one on my foot and the one behind my ear did hurt a good bit.  Where were you thinking about getting it?
Speaker B: I hadn't really thought about it! Maybe upper arm or upper back? But I'm no tattoo expert. And I'd have to get permission from my wife first, LOL
Speaker A: Definitely talk to her first.  I had a friend that didn't talk to his wife and just came home with a tattoo one day.  It led to a huge fight - both about the money he spent and not discussing it with her.  He slept on my couch for over a week!
Speaker B: Oh no! Yeah, you don't want to spring something like that on your spouse. I don't think you mentioned before, are you married?
Speaker A: No.  I haven't found anyone that could deal with me or that I could deal with for more than a few months.  At this point, I have given up on the idea of getting married and want to focus on my artwork.

Have you done any interesting art/graffiti lately?",I've been working on a new graffiti project lately.

"Speaker A fosters dogs till they find a forever home.
Speaker A fosters dogs and is used to them coming and going.","Speaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. 
Speaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.
Speaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. 
Speaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it. 
Speaker A: That is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks?
Speaker B: The only trick I was able to teach him, that I deeply regret, was how locks worked. I thought it was cool at first, you know, to see a raccoon unlock a door. And now, I regret it so much. I've had to change the layout of my apartment and put deadbolts on my doors so that Bandicoot can't get out. And, he is sneaky about it. One time, he unlocked the pantry and was eating some cookies! It's like having a toddler that never grows up.
Speaker A: That is bad I guess.  Do you keep all of your chemicals, poisons, and medications up and locked?  I would hate to think what might happen if Bandicoot got into any of that.  Hey, when you drive do you lock him up in a cage or let him wander around in the car?  That could be dangerous for you driving and he freaks out.
Speaker B: All the chemicals and poisons are in a gated lock in the basement. The lock requires a specific key, which I have hidden in my drawers. For medication, I have a small box that I also keep locked up, but it's a combination lock, so Bandicoot isn't able to get into it. For driving, I bought a harness that keeps him strapped in the back seat, he can move a bit, but mostly sturdy. I put blankets down and his favorite toys so that he stays calm. Sometimes, I'll pass small snacks to keep him occupied. I also take the side streets to work so that it's not too much for him. What about you? When you foster dogs, do you put them in a cage when you drive?
Speaker A: I do keep the dogs secured. You never knwo how they are going to react.  Most of them I only have for a few days, so I really do not get a chance to see how they will act in all situations.  
Speaker B: Oh, does that make you want to adopt a dog? I know you said it makes you sad to see them come and go, so why not adopt one?","Fostering dogs is a rewarding experience for me. While it can be tough to see them go, I find comfort in knowing that I can help them find their forever homes. Each dog that comes through my doors leaves a paw print on my heart, and I cherish the time I spend with them, no matter how brief it may be. Adopting a dog is a big commitment, but for now, I'll continue to foster and provide temporary care and love for those in need."
"Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.

Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? 
Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.
Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. 
Speaker A: why don't you like books like that?
Speaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading?","Yes, there is actually a movie adaptation of the book I'm reading. It's quite thrilling, but I can see why you prefer the more light-hearted animal-themed movies."
"Speaker A is from a city known for great iced teas and prefers unsweetened iced tea.
Speaker A enjoys drinking tea and water.
Speaker A lives on the Moon, where it is cold with very little traffic.","Speaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin!
Speaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name? 
Speaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls! 
Speaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well?
Speaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens.
Speaker B: hehe you're right. But i can't explain that why I am not a cat person to you sorry. How's the weather like today, still good weather to have iced tea out there?","I might have some iced tea outside, but only if I can bring Pumpkin along to join us. Maybe the fresh air will make you a cat person after all!"

Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.","Speaker B: How are your pet snakes doing?
Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha!
Speaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes?
Speaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe. 
Speaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm? ",Do you plan on taking Hansel and Gretel with you to your college dorm?
"Speaker A recently gave birth to twins and is a stay-at-home mom.
Speaker A wants more children and feels lonely due to their husband's frequent traveling.","Speaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.
Speaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.
Speaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping?
Speaker B: I love being out in the wilderness and sleeping under the stars in the fresh air. It makes you realize how beautiful life is and how small we really are in comparison to the universe.
Speaker A: I miss doing that! I have done lots of picnics with my family but it's been a long time since I've slept in a tent! Looking forward to it again when the kids are older.
