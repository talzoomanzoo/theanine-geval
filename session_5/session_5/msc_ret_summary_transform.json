Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\nSpeaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\nSpeaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler.\nSpeaker B: Ah yes, that's my favorite time of year. Oh and speaking of Tasha, I'm still amazed she knows Mandarin. Have you been learning more of the language?\nSpeaker A: I've been learning a little more. I try to learn a few things a day. Tasha's reactions to my talking to myself in Mandarin is funny, she looks confused most of the time.\nSpeaker B: That is funny. And impressive that you're learning. The closest I can get to another language is doing a bad New York accent LOL\nSpeaker A: I can't wait to go to New York and hear that accent. It's a great accent, always makes me laugh a little though.",

How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nSpeaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study?\nSpeaker B: Ah, English should be easier than History. Sure, I can help you. What do you need to do exactly? Write an essay?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, we have to write an essay and we have a spelling component towards the end of the exam, I sure could use a little help!\nSpeaker B: No problem! I like correcting and editing essays. Although, it seems like your English is pretty good. I doubt you even need much help.\nSpeaker A: Excellent, thank you for taking the time to help me out a little. I would like to get an A!",

I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nSpeaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\nSpeaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. \nSpeaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it. \nSpeaker A: That is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks?\nSpeaker B: The only trick I was able to teach him, that I deeply regret, was how locks worked. I thought it was cool at first, you know, to see a raccoon unlock a door. And now, I regret it so much. I've had to change the layout of my apartment and put deadbolts on my doors so that Bandicoot can't get out. And, he is sneaky about it. One time, he unlocked the pantry and was eating some cookies! It's like having a toddler that never grows up.\nSpeaker A: That is bad I guess.  Do you keep all of your chemicals, poisons, and medications up and locked?  I would hate to think what might happen if Bandicoot got into any of that.  Hey, when you drive do you lock him up in a cage or let him wander around in the car?  That could be dangerous for you driving and he freaks out.\nSpeaker B: All the chemicals and poisons are in a gated lock in the basement. The lock requires a specific key, which I have hidden in my drawers. For medication, I have a small box that I also keep locked up, but it's a combination lock, so Bandicoot isn't able to get into it. For driving, I bought a harness that keeps him strapped in the back seat, he can move a bit, but mostly sturdy. I put blankets down and his favorite toys so that he stays calm. Sometimes, I'll pass small snacks to keep him occupied. I also take the side streets to work so that it's not too much for him. What about you? When you foster dogs, do you put them in a cage when you drive?\nSpeaker A: I do keep the dogs secured. You never knwo how they are going to react.  Most of them I only have for a few days, so I really do not get a chance to see how they will act in all situations.  \nSpeaker B: Oh, does that make you want to adopt a dog? I know you said it makes you sad to see them come and go, so why not adopt one?",

Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \nSpeaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows.\nSpeaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity. \nSpeaker B: Yes, I agree. What kind of hours would this new job have?\nSpeaker A: It's third shift, which isn't the greatest, but it pays a bit more than the other shifts, and I think I'll like getting off early in the morning. Then I can just go down and get in my hammock and have a nice relaxing moment after work. \nSpeaker B: Would you feel safe being out there all alone, possibly falling asleep? That just sounds a bit risky.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, you know the area it's in. It's pretty safe, but I'm also a light sleeper. Thank you for your concern though. You are a good friend.",
