It's something I'm not proud of, but it's a part of my past that I can't change. ### Mentor: Of course, Mentee. I'm here to listen and support you. Could you tell me more about your experience with substance abuse? ### Mentee: Sure. I started drinking when I was 15, and it quickly became a habit. It was a way to escape from my problems and feel better about myself. But over time, the drinking got worse, and I started using other substances too. It was a downward spiral, and I didn't know how to stop. ### Mentor: That sounds incredibly tough, Mentee. I imagine that getting sober was not an easy journey. ### Mentee: It definitely wasn't. I had to confront a lot of difficult emotions and learn how to cope with them in healthy ways. But now that I'm sober, I feel so much better about myself. I don't wake up feeling ashamed or guilty anymore, and I can focus on building a better life for myself. ### Mentor: That's amazing, Mentee. Congratulations on your sobriety. I'm so proud of the progress you've made. ### Mentee: Thank you, Mentor. I couldn't have done it without your guidance and support. It's been a journey, but I know that staying sober is the right choice for me. ### Mentor: I'm always here for you, Mentee. If you ever need to talk or want some advice, don't hesitate to reach out.

How have you been doing it? ### Mentee: Just paying attention to the little things that I used to take for granted. When I'm eating, for example, I try to really savor the tastes and textures of the food. And when I'm outside, I try to notice all the small details - the way the sunlight is streaming through the leaves of the trees, the sounds of the birds singing, and the feel of the breeze on my skin. ### Mentor: That's a great approach. It's amazing how much more you can appreciate your life when you slow down and pay attention to the things that matter. ### Mentee: Absolutely. I used to feel so overwhelmed all the time, like life was just passing me by. But now that I'm living in the moment, I feel like I'm really experiencing everything fully. It's brought me so much joy and fulfillment. ### Mentor: That's wonderful to hear. Keep up the good work, Mentee.
